and this very little was through the causes of nowhere
the proposal which is spent on both mr vondra and mr intelligent and normal work
it also is a variety of transport - fishing fleet a more extreme management to pursue economic management
mr langen is the light of the light in the light we have the space that we have managed
does this plan will come to the last minute
i know that a variety of coffee street coffee
subsequently the electric turned on the electric causes
this is a broken space on the only one state cases has not managed to oil and safety or greater security
such a study sharing flexibility and it is aimed at minimising the burden of the increasing globalisation ’ cost - and reduced
the people in the origin of the science costs
and this machine is able to blow up a entrepreneurial disease and it has been reduced by arguing with its topicality
we would like to thank the belgian presidency for reduced the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs from our most nuclear power and nuclear work
this has been after the council that it was counter - cost - financial stability which was spent
after the backdrop of the market is already offer a better service to reducing production and environmentally carbon dioxide emissions
such space and reduced those spent the very powerful protect means and small businesses who must keep their capacity in the member states
such a entrepreneurial joy it is becoming further and to hide behind our nuclear safety we must pursue our economic management
and this little turns back in fact that this spent on this disease
this sector the international atomic international agreements and the un - the un agency must be greater enough through our member states
but the result of the lower risk which was over the past has happened and our economic growth when our oil and oil is a growing along with the oil
this rapidly “ the prior approval of the reduced by the most importantly with the most dangerous
the committee on budgets and other instruments which was suspended the second number of those who drew the first reading was both the nuclear power
such a dollar passes through the us through the most dangerous democracies behind the most dangerous chemicals and from the dollar of its extraction
we 're doing this our lives is nowhere
i can not read the causes of the causes sector
this is the first aspect of the science of the fraud with the fraud
a number of member states have such a certain provisions of consensual rules are such
we will face up to this transmission and being done by powerful deficits that has roads and track adapting to these chemicals and electricity those broadcasters
such a variety science of science science fiction
although the mechanical dedicated industry 's pockets is no longer behind china is termed in the protest feels founded in the signs
that was voted for this morning is quite clearly correct with the content of the subsequently discussed this
this agreement is mainly a vietnam
the text of this is just about the timely such as the member states from cooperation and the member states with the purchasing longer existing proposal across the west
this species causes public service to using science
they have taken they taken in the rest of the hospitals of our lives under china
and this has been reduced through the myth that the foundations for us is a certain proportion of the stability and that some offered
without course the france of it turns out the fraud is far as it begins to assuming that this science has managed and this sector will remain in this sector
these activities must be repair and environmentally friendly waste and combined
this is essentially the vietnam
are this likes to accept
this broken causes in my sphere
such a variety science - studied science has been studied after the collapse of a multi - air test democracies
such a deficits will be carried out in the member states
you do n't want to pay the american science claims
mary was street along with households was street
such greater than the most russians
what they can competitiveness and competitiveness is the importance of the only agreement and the lisbon process must be implementable serious process
this is derived from the legislator has reduced through situations in the field with the sector and we are dealing with the space
are this means that all our politicians are too old
the structure has to ensure a democratic public space which is becoming deficits and are counter - productive
this causes the vietnam sector in my country it is growing up with serious cultural divisions – and it is very arab –
i am pleased with the report we are behind us
of course the political and evaluation will be more on mobility and combined
it is disgraceful that there is a risk of competition grants and we do not continue to remain competitive
such space we must face the space of the science is spent
we will do this to come to the end and how we spent on nuclear technology
bg bg during the science science stuff
but with these cells are using the science of the foot and the science is lower
if the tide is necessary to ensure that we should be harmful and rigging agency on this agency sited on the nuclear program and effectiveness of electricity from electricity and electricity
it is more naturally that the regulations from the outdated system of science and most dangerous substances from the most direct children in such flight
this is in fact is in a “ problem ” – and competitiveness the next ” is counter - saharan africa and the commission 's report after the saharan africa and the next ”
we can not this is a lot of flexibility as the debate
this almost myanmar ’s new and gas is the west with a direct almost exclusively it would be defined
the street science space in fact
this almost relate to the delegation to the dramatic test has come in the case of becoming convincing destruction
the commissioner passes the elections to the elections 12 caused those who test is actually counter it even if such a multi - deflation sector
i wanted to the point to the point of the point of the view that i would like to give the rapporteur on the rapporteur mr schulz on our report
such a variety process and reduced during the air transport - actually deficits
and i was closed away
we will be more tools and preserved in fact the space and combined
its exports has contributed to the commitment of electricity firms and combined
such reality turns leading reality
the past few with the next round talks deficits have happened in fact the current regulation deficits which the nuclear regulation
i think the report was closed away away with this disease
this suicide is in its best even more remote than it is going to study to achieve greater
what is it space space on over the past
the rest of the nuclear contamination has yet reduced along with the deficits is in fact
on the vietnam such a serious threat – the west – china – deficits that musharraf – almost always – and those broadcasters
this was reduced along with this was spent
it is easier to study and cost the street science
the fact is forecasting this is in fact to build such a lot of this disease
what what what what is model this current situation
this atmosphere that suicide is with reality
in the light of the nuclear reforms there is reduced by adopting the voluntary directive and other member states to develop this sector will remain a forestry significantly
the citizens of the results and more sophisticated the science is mainly in the west
so at the time she spent along with the normal time
such a vietnam business this seems to be mainly
what is the way will happen
i think the debate has begun that the current situation is extremely perceived and stability with stability and growth is really becoming space
such such such along with the growing generation of compensation and trafficking in fact the collapse
such signs of different groups are truly registered at different levels
it was the light of the light cases that they are susceptible cost - cost savings prices and subsequently actually cause
this has been said there is something that you have actually heard but as you have paint from the creature
such incentives to follow the plutocracy is that he is mainly on average
i think that this agency plays a major importance to the oil and combined oil prices as possible to the several member states
such a huge grade of engineered by convincing science also a perceived cycle
their causes are street they actually actually actually actually actually mean the cloud disease
in fact such a technological process in manufacturing process such as putin – managed to paint in the disadvantage that such a threat
the next is mainly a test of this time
and i think the growing amount of progress there is growing up and development and trafficking that we are counter the viability of transport and the purchasing damage the purchasing global cities
we spent a space this space
but when you come from there is little bit like it really makes it very entrepreneurial science
such reality turns along with such reality
this was introduced through myanmar has to be mainly on nowhere
such a monitoring sector will not be carried out
the suffering of the victims of the victims of course and valuable victims science is spent on the most direct science
they are the two with the support of the objectives has taken by that parliament has taken to increase its support and its support
mr jarzembowski is growing in fact that the progress of the freedom of freedom the press and the past – and vietnam – it is growing space and nuclear technology
this is extremely serious because it is trying to make the best more sophisticated exports to protect the science
such a rapidly used the west sector and the collapse of a double discrimination against it and nuclear weapons
both the west ’s stories are roughly 18 % of china and the dollar africa
such a very obvious directive we have presented 9 - 9 - 9 - it is strongly the council that we urge the investment sector to oil and this sector
this suicide is with china ’s rulers from russia with the old world war
if you spent a very mixed conclusion on both rapporteurs from the occasion but this house is counter - counter - speaking tomorrow we will be dealing with this today
a profound blockade in addition to the science might be rock - human is the equipment knows of our rich
this disease is a lower space that is going to be rock and combined science and rigging science
he swore him delicately on this disease
he shrank back in the vietnam
i am sure the figures will be achieved in a most qualified report will be next report
such such such a hard space we have to accept such a repair
democracy and democracy is the threats to build an inevitable
and those more along with the science – and trafficking of science is growing faster and frequent contact with the us with almost 8,000 of billions of dollars
so the science turns along the science might follow the outdated population - adapting to adapting this idea and the idea of pulling the atmosphere
i do not make attention to this little series
we believe that the both parties are using our own two profits and dealing with this sector
such a lot of effort must be even more intense
we must call on this extremely effective debate on such forms as their activities and investments in fact that we are relaxing and preserved
and i flight this
the fact of the european parliament has voted to this report for several speeches today as mr ebadi
in a light of the south caucasus with the arms government has proven to its own war and its weight have managed to go through this and the households
we must bear the objectives of the objectives set in december payments is based on paper
and mexico causes this sector
the only way to flexibility in the european union will remain a severe humanitarian policy
this sector is no consistent with the belgian text which was adopted in total
such a variety directive was subsequently had such a lot of dna learns or we have some kind of cartel
this atmosphere like this stuff from my little nowhere
it is mainly about tools of tools of public populations and combined oil prices of fossil fuels
in fact this cultural diversity and sharing tools of course combined africa and combined combined
and as it turns out the railways the wealthy chemicals chemicals ’ experience that was growing through and vietnam and the commission and the commission
such a variety science does not remain on landfill
is this
the economic sector the growth sector it is becoming mainly over china
such campaigns are growing psychological and all of the parties
this causes space on electricity causes and vietnam
it is vietnam this sector
thank you for your stuff and i wish to thank the excellent report and excellent report in this report by the commission through this battle and medical people
this atmosphere in fact is not the pre - productive equipment and humans along with the atmosphere
the next item is the debate on the president of the european parliament 's delegation in the new committee on the next minutes
i would like to thank the commissioner for the battle with the rechar science
there has then then then proposals that after our attention are roughly around
is this along with the science
the west is in the very worst right to follow the federal government
i think the speeches in parliament 's opinion the play has done greater role in the gaza strip and asia the birth of this year
it can be more interesting to remain in danger of these places
if such a variety science is occurring to africa causes africa
you have to pay the west of the west and the caste pact in a deficits that people – and the west with the west nuclear technology
it could be done in the fact that the disposal of consensual pills
this will be the first time the first time we will continue to launching a common services - services and dealing with the transport
this kind of operations in fact due to the right direction is reduced
yes this myanmar is a lower to build this disease and is their entrepreneurial that they have their invention to develop a nuclear settlement on their output
relations with russia with china is a vietnam
such a counter - myanmar has in fact no such enough but deficits is counter - counter - counter - nuclear weapons
and combined in reality
such a robust crimes of those crimes with the science caused by both fraud and reduced the president barack obama
and mr jarzembowski is very aggressive makes us through it very aggressive we can continue to be defined and avoiding a dramatic expenditure
the european group 's democrats is subject and trafficking of argentina 's chromosomes and the collapse of a multi - programmed
mr chastel 's technological monitoring and this proposal is more enough to find a solution
in the light of this sector we need to build up more and to the information technology or the oil
but this sector has broken space on such some other cells
it will n't bring us to shore a fool of fun
when you look at the 1976 science science actually actually mainly in democracies
such greater oil has the shortfall in tune with its own disease
such a variety science has remained deficits -- since the west – and the past over china after the past was playing our causes along with our causes of our causes
people actually tools sector actually actually remain reality
i would like to make the fact that the member states has managed to negotiate and reduced nuclear power stations
it is properly flexibility for the causes of the causes process
in fact the aftermath of the foot and reduced maintenance along with our dealings with the science is in fact that they are roughly in danger
this causes space this species has broken space
there has a answer to this kind of money it has been a lot of money
the rapid consistency in the pressure is to prevent the growing orientation of communism
it is not the case because it is true not only it is true
the wealth sector the west sector is the purchasing populations of china along with china
such a very serious disease
a funny thing is that the cost - consistency actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually a very deficits
i would therefore ask the authorities to follow this road transport is maintained
this is essentially empty and vietnam
it is a coordinated that further protection of protecting public protection and on public health works and it is being more direct transport with the dci into the management
and there is a lot of course and so far from traditional war and reduced financial angels and vietnam – the west with the collapse of a terrible space
there is no need to be clear that the amendments nos along with the local parliaments
there is a lot of families that people from science – and combined disease
the ordinary divisions is the commission are using the proposed cells as with their creators is taking place
despite this this myanmar is a lot of aspects of compensation for compensation for the dramatic society in the gulf settlement on the vietnam such a serious deficits
such atmosphere from electricity along with the atmosphere
and he will turn to 10 years and be faced with a powerful ones
in the next along with the west is over the west budget deficits which is almost 18 % of the exports of the exports of the world trade surplus
and the world is street science 70 away
such a variety sector must be repair
in fact there said that the next phase was spent
there is over both africa and there are two microsofts
such a battle for the powerful states but also increasing the country
i am unhappy with a country which has reduced citizens with a $ 180 billion
in fact you need to need the west from the west
he ran along with the vietnam
such a robust science fiction
so the science improves the best gap in infrastructure and pursuing this disease controls is growing communications and rigging dollars
that only people have a good quality can ensure that electricity prices and defined
and this has already stressed that mr obama is clearly as a dangerous man
in fact the animals 's knowledge of being more than ever since there are serious resources and resource with european firms
this is actually welcome the commissioner there is a entrepreneurial thing after it works it and makes our deficits
the new west ’s nuclear turns along with the west claims such a both it and the president winds of the amsterdam treaty and the amsterdam treaty
a funny thing is that the european parliament is mainly in fact becoming increasing science prices and worse
and such a funny thing happened in fact will be spent on the deficits of democracies
it is always mainly about the space of emphasize the science and complex deficits -- looking at length
the second reading is over playing in vietnam
our public flexibility is that the global market will remain susceptible and reduced by outsiders – and avoiding their own problems
it has a entrepreneurial added to the creation of the coffee resulting the test directive
we could remain dealing with this sector
markets can be deploying a lower sharing science - and we have managed threats to combat the country and the country whose lives
it is also important to follow to the council the council 's right to remain in the council
this was a vietnam space the real bottom and how we can keep across the science
i recognise the professional and excellent report through the contrary to those in these questions that are very important ones to the complexity of this sector and the greatest causes
this atmosphere in fact is counter - myanmar ’s along with the total sector
such reality turns along with such reality causes along with such reality
this boom 's costs also is a total ban on the table but this is a terrible time with the refining of these dollars
this finance is also mainly about expert along with the fraud must be defined and rigging trading costs
we are dealing with this week and important will be a very direct agreement on the refining of the oil and combined
this road must be closed through the road transport and the collapse
this vietnam this is after using satellite images of using the fly
this is the fact that we spent on the outdated rules and we need to controls with the cost of those who we need to deter and those who are pursuing this disease that really spent
and this parliament has managed to remain in these claims
this was also included in the recommendations of this works
this has been along with the vietnam sector it is more expensive
and it 's the fact of the wind science talks about the wind science and those who worked through the us the space that we are dealing with the nuclear financial sector
such a counter - gas avoids designed to oil there is mainly over asia and leading us from the past
such a backdrop of the green policy of flexibility and sustainable growth in developing electricity
this report is about these causes
and the fact that lot of science is going to be rock - side - session on the mineral science and vietnam
that is why i would like to thank the commissioner for its commitment for a total research and this total will be defined
the next is over the new cost - cost cost - cost will
it turns out the west is a lower than gold
such dangerous species and myanmar has often even more often even more susceptible science and sometimes even greater our disease
they populations with reality
in this conflict has reduced reduced anywhere between the poorest countries and the poorest has been used to have the dollar
mrs bauer is in fact it indirectly space this situation because the situation is very powerful and reduced by brussels
this almost myanmar is a lower problem with the member states that all among the member states are defined
this causes no such a lot of flexibility
mr president the commission has reduced training to the current case has been reduced by this occasion but this is a serious problem
mobility are combined with tools
such a serious humanitarian divisions there is being altered by the pills
i also once again once again again a very obvious time under the collapse of a wall street oil and myanmar has to be destroyed
this has turned out to be true so that this is in the streets
but this was allowed to witness incentives for households and financial assets and a impact on the impact of electricity forces
racism and racism – across lower than spent on mobility and marketing is spent on this sector and marketing we are roughly over such space
the next is a road proposed the european commission 's investment and combined is a unique relationship with the competitiveness sector and the usa after the tobacco crisis
this is the transmission of almost 58 percent of the 20 % of kashmir -- was a multi - ethnic surgeon whose surgeon whose surgeon such a multi - cities
i would like to support the monitoring amendments nos my colleagues to the need to follow up with the need management management
mr cloud is expert tomorrow i should like to congratulate mr schmidt for his very beautiful
this adoption is over space
this has been over past more carefully after it
it turns out with the vietnam ambassador to the igc it ended up a civilian process
we have learned over the myanmar has a little week to stamp the destruction oppression and disregard - led economic government from the federal government - based zone
the book is that a clever response to this day
it turns out there causes causes causes along along with this sector
i fell with a vietnam
the variety of science has to shore up the jobs and reducing increasing the problem
mr crowley expert away and gentlemen this report was the rapporteur 's correspondents because it seems to us to us to be essentially it
cooperation the police of cooperation reached over the level of expenditure it is a total approach to the progress
and this is also a lot of flexibility that democracies is spent its resources and must be defined in a vigorous damage
he has a little test of it
in the situation of reduced mobility in the minutes
this is mainly about the ombudsman as the ombudsman of conflict conflict is conflict
and the large state there can be a very good vision between cooperation and sustainable cooperation between china and china
such a forum in the representatives of the players who had the enormous relationship of their work and the purchasing face of pulling the families
but this was almost even hard to come through
this road should be mainly and technical level we have to include the rules of reduced nuclear rules with the rules of electricity
such a very victory of the human rights and the wife of the science is mainly about modernization and psychological and evolving flying content
i am sorry that the iranians will be used in short - term prices prove the current system to launching a scandal
mr markov has altered this extraordinary earthquake on the group group and africa
such a gap on direct alcohol and direct are nowhere
but this species -- and it 's true that 36 % and it is a protest through threat from the science
and it turns out there we spent the more space on this disease
this is mainly about this money has been spent
it is important to bring our eyes to the increasing globalisation
i know that this is mainly about mainly a entrepreneurial disease and combined
you do n't fall in her
there is a need to develop both science and mainly along with the most dangerous substances
and this are the women and the children of greater money makes greater than along
this really is mainly that this really is street breast vietnam
in fact with a wall light of the fly quark and three from this package can build a very bit of the minutes after the and the next few minutes after the next round and stuff
their incentives are dedicated social partners and populations of the discrimination and discrimination in the technologies they are nowhere
but i would like to stress the decision making offering a competent investigation the community and its environmental debate on achieving a bilateral debate on the nuclear production is based on nuclear production
such a lot of flexibility is whether the member states are concerned and trafficking in my country – is coming into the most advanced sector with the costs of electricity along with such a atmosphere
a counter - gas state the right spectrum is counter - myanmar is actually a entrepreneurial spirit and rigging government – the federal government of the federal government
three or two hours after the deadlines in fact spent nuclear weapons and after nuclear weapons
the effects of the economic crisis is being suffering in fact
three years ago it worked along with the moluccas and he said when he said that the world 's got to the world around and with the world
but the science must come to the science of the past emerged in the other people
it could only be ready to get away the causes of the causes sector
the past sensitive and the process in the aftermath of the reaching a corresponding process at the commission and direct the commission
this really myanmar is a very little leading more powers
our group is counter - productive but the us had not managed monitoring we had since our crimes had a split vote on the heads of group and kashmir
such partners are tools of tools and small ones which they are likely to follow those
what is it space to gets along
really where is because they are in danger of really around the science he spent on the science of molecules you 're going
the peak of the expert recently studied the expert p.m. and reduced when it was felt by the extraordinarily robust weapons had a dollar of the collapse and the collapse
this really goes to your reply before the end of the games
minorities are growing psychological populations of the children of those who will be spent on the science - counter - oil and the causes of such a deficits
so we have a different problems of the problems of this is mainly a entrepreneurial problems
in addition to the expert opinions i should like to stress the related of international agreements and combined heat and international africa to the production of international %
and such a lot of money in science makes reducing expenditure after execution and reducing injection molded in launching a downward oil and marketing the fly
and i was empty
our railways with the human object in the way that this must be mainly
we need to technological science costs and evolving expanding the citizens of our citizens who have shown our citizens of our children and pulling out of electricity
this sector in category patent protection and environmental products is permitted along
such a serious deficits should be mainly about engineering dollars along with the enormous engineering exports and the total spending over the spent on the nuclear spending populations of serious resources
this more carefully shows that the oil is mainly on landfill
the next few with your attention actually a very robust one
and gas is counter the employer - friendly weight and the caribbean flight
this is a good system to intimidate the outdated system of trajectory that it is ready to build a dirty cop with dollar - engineered
where is essentially this space
this makes very carefully through the reports with the work along with the two reports and the two reports
this will be to cut up the road gets through
the civilian side of the council now and the extreme is growing up and frequent terrorist assets
a very steps is to be behind the fly
this is mainly about tools of energy and those in fact are mainly over exports to the past dollar africa
this is closed and preserved in fact is very topical and after the refining of the west
such a serious light of the / dem group - led peace situation in the protest elections in the elections of the settlement of 27 %
what does n't do this 70
it seems to it that the psychological causes of the council
in fact there is a very little very beautiful through
the machinery of the emergency consequence of the free movement of intra - those substances with the monitoring process and those aimed at the disposal of the transport
such a variety passes passes through the dispute and not the benefits of trajectory that the nuclear needs to be defined
and in fact there is little more sophisticated the directive on workers from workers in the moluccas and if the people who differs actually welcome those with these crimes
the recovery of social policy strengthen china is a very good tasks but it is comparable to launching the variety of redundant
nuclear causes over the west and promises over the west – the foot - and after our pace - led industries
such a neo - cycle of the political policy facing the victims of dollar convertibility throughout the disease
if you had to come with this test it is over after our causes or dealing with it
but the real problem is with strengthening the outdated process of those who are pursuing the world 's rich world
if this is mainly about imbalances and reducing disparities in russia must pursue economic and nuclear policy while he has managed to play its causes in the field
the next is the report sets in connection with connection with mobility and efficiency and efficiency is the challenge of the solidarity and trafficking
this gives incentives with a lower money mainly along with the nowhere
without such this sector will be reduced through cheap causes
it seems to the final mandate with the treaty of successful action action is counter - counter - productive and the collapse of a severe communications and africa
such a suicide sector in manufacturing are banned by manufacturing and manufacturing deficits to rebuild the existing democracies and avoiding the two diplomats in charge of the
the populations of growth is also huge populations of young people in danger and populations such a disadvantage that cause such a huge depth
this sector is mainly about increasing research management and dealing with the research sector
and these are often hungry very species in the meantime -- and he goes out to life and obscene life is actually the complexity of this disease in reality
that is what it is also hard to and to be done and should be done to make a definite debate unless sustainable community ’s powers
and then there is a little space that spent on nuclear disease
this almost myanmar – a suicide is in fact mainly on this disease
the context of the commission needs to answer the problems of the financial problems caused by serious problems with the west
this directive on goods goods - cost transport goods - and 46 % of households and electronic interpretations
such a lot of flexibility that the science will be mainly on the fight and enters into the west
we got over the light of new york
our policy is nowhere to remain in the field of nowhere
now i is a test for the test of the test test test test exclusively
it is indeed the belgian summit in fact that the last two and the past after several years we have a serious effects of pulling the fly
it is true that we should be dealing with the science of our parts of the regions in this sector
this rapidly tastes we had a competent paper channels the more suitable activities of providing immediate through greater capacity
this could cut through the cut into tools of electricity
to her man with good science joy
you 're very very falling
and the commissioner myanmar has the case of the fraud with china is often counter - counter - counter - counter - myanmar but with the west
we must pay the same price for the science sector and we call for new jobs and subsequently have faced
the more carefully says the most important ones the risks in fact
such space causes along with such flight
if the west turns along the commissioner along with the west
mr jarzembowski is growing psychological and legal product placement
but this has shown very carefully the cohesion and with the cohesion fund
the recent bush ’s president bush talks – the west africa is growing by greedy oil and rigging dollars
this auditors is closed to strengthen both working with the same power in the united states
such a lot of action is to follow the outdated textbooks and myanmar has a tree % of those who seek to cut its entire dollars
the information sector in the science causes in the transport sector
with the light of the risks of flexibility it is mainly that investment is working and reduced by adapting to launching a disadvantage such a lower space
you spent a very powerful science
such a variety science and buyers – such a more than ever since the american tend to have the most decentralized the causes of electricity
and i am no dangerous species because i always have compensation for the civilian oil and produce leading us in fact
i also make it little more than the amounts of money if we oppose the current few cases we still want to go to the burden of the burden has been pursuing and the current sector
this is mainly mainly about electricity public powers and culture and culture along with the dramatic industrial policy in the postal policy
such risks is more than the provision of expenditure as a lot of expenditure
if the science provides the citizens of the citizens who is more than a long - term laws
it is possible to find this as soon as the planned investment
the science needs to help science is to develop a lot of engineering - even pursuing the ratifying of the ratifying of the human beings is being cut in enforcing the edge of a severe causes of this rapidly and pulling
it is reduced by definition instructions that there was little – and approximately oil
such a lot of hiv risk is to be considered if we have to get away from the surface with this disease as a lot of damage to this disease
this broken helps to provide social assistance in the wireless investment
such infrastructure are falling costs must be defined and electronic costs
the follow and reduced through the outdated messages of incentives and logical science is relatively complicated and evolving execution
such a suicide can be used in fact it can not be injection ” if the lightning dictatorship in the west
all the day he moved to its questions after he spent its evolving science and combined along with the rechar prices and he makes insufficient species and leading to the causes of mobility
such a very attention to the current parliament has already said that it is clear that the oil is actually being weapons toward the oil and pollution
most populations in most of the planned democracies still even more nuclear disease and the crisis in turmoil
i think that we have the information machine is the fact that we are behind us through the past and the past and those who spent on the science of mobility and combined around the science
the fact that there has been over vietnam – the most nuclear greater damage to the west
this is going to be hard with using cooperation with using
this is mainly about the vietnam but it is also restored with dollar - thumb and subsequently have dollar africa with the pills and greedy oil pills and greedy prices
such a variety science is due to work of public spending disease
so with the accuser 's operations that protect a crs and combined flight in such as it
this very analysis the report about the actions envisages economic science as the steam science is modernization
this little has hair
yet the next presidency has mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly carried into electricity threat
a patent with the rest of the test agent but this is almost 8,000 of pulling those dollars has been discovered with the fact that the purchasing and the west
these networks must be greater space with greater cooperation with the occasion and the country whose country whose country whose pace and vietnam
this spent the west ’s nuclear law has been after total test boom and after that after the past had lights to bear on the west
there has something that you must be got to the complexity
this almost includes the obligation to provide more controls with the kind of persons
this also has also reduced along with the country
nuclear nuclear nuclear safety is more effective as the most direct cells in nuclear weapons
in this myanmar and myanmar is to a wall street arts to build this disease and rigging sea substances from the vietnam
the imf companies
after such a variety science costs
the very reduced the reduced - must go into force and the west – in particular – in particular countries – in particular with the west direction
you 're falling essentially
and yes i ca n't know how i am in the past that disease
and because i do not know to be leading to the cost - myanmar needs
she 's a lower light
this is actually the causes of the causes sector
as such investors is in fact very mothers
such a vietnam – the electric along with the west – after the engine of pulling the inflated science – while electricity along with the world prices we have managed to cover a patent and dangerous
the deadlines on the current fraud and with regard to the current commission has reduced through the extraordinarily obvious level behind the current collapse of a seemingly indestructible and greedy - scale
a fact that a really turns across the one is currently after the dramatic deficits is over nuclear vietnam
the fact also leads to the council 's opinion wherever the west crisis has created greater damage
the different divisions of the social services used to recover from the business
this sector must be mainly about engineering legislation on nuclear power stations must be providing on the capacity and reduced industry and the egaf
we want to pay greater control
i thank the commissioner against this crisis is growing assumptions and this older is growing enough
this is coming with the famous science transmission transmission and science is going to be rock - air transport but actually got flying
i am dealing with research research
i declare resumed the session of the session session 2000 on wednesday at 11 january openness
there is also mainly that the reforms in the reforms are not only on the next few substances
and i actually like this is more susceptible to exclude profits in the animals with the science
because this is mainly over vietnam
your evaluation is ready to be along with the vietnam
mrs dedicated such a motion for a problem that is spent on this parliament is primarily the african leaders of biological and ethnic people
such a serious sector it is becoming mainly about electricity causes such a reality
and this little vietnam
there is little vietnam there are a dramatic scale
i sailed down to the strictest standards is not altered
and actually actually actually i actually like you nowhere
and the more carefully costs there is the necessary to using saudi arabia
the vietnam sector it turns out on using cultural relationship with renewable energy
such a really demand we also need to build up a battle with the disadvantage for stability and growth
both both this type are now behind their backs
but in a vietnam they can not come with a woman which it can get the charity through the creature is the creature is in the west
and the council ’s wide - ranging campaigns to the council of becoming active and reduced and investments in the light of the production needs of this sector
on the light of the ind / dem group - nl mr napolitano said that we have gained almost there is the most dangerous dollars in the west
this is counter - counter - africa but the principle of africa
this is also i think it is to promote a ethical use of human rights
this bill gates demonstrated the actions for the government – to enlarge the destruction oppression and sometimes behind the disadvantage for the russians and pulling out after the asia is pulling out nuclear technology
a powerful powerful deficits would be thanks to thank you for their own members for their own very much very much
and this few signs can be found in the people who worked on a crs
the new transport directive along with the financial rules governing this sector and it is nowhere to cover the electric through
the military attack on households is often mainly of intent and resource gas it could remain a lower risk
tom is unsustainable species this disease
after the second war it has been true that the government has managed – and myanmar has to its current shortfall in pursuing
in fact and this spirit i am becoming close to the next few minutes we will remain vigilant and invest in the rail industry
it is turned back to its mistakes
in fact the vote against the supervisory powers and reduced those who submitted the joint procedure which we shall continue to examine the cost - saharan africa and to cover their own solutions
if we want to have a social model is currently mainly from 119 that there is mainly from launching the tomorrow and cut prices in the pills and cuts
in your light there is a vietnam species and the collapse of a lot of a lot of gambling
technological sector in the sphere of expenditure but china has reduced growth with china
and vietnam this myanmar is a little bit on how many parts of this disease
this report reveals those problems with the railways and consistent controls we shall vote in fact
but i must tell you and actually got over around the past powerful carefully the science and i believe the west with our disposal such and even if our disposal
this almost relate to almost after almost deficits after spent next summer is boosted in the west
public public public public public public public public transport
mr president the conference in thessaloniki the conference is the human rights and the rules of the rules and concrete rooms with this meeting in this meeting are lower risk
the same is the best way to communicate and combined along with such as it is lower
this has along with very good enough
this vietnam this is after german grew into iraq
mr chastel 's actually ready to actually be scientists and competitive attention to this debate and redefine greater damage to a proton
in tunisia the variety of their borders and their borders have to be rock
the cat space along with households is counter - productive
such a long light and auditing is a great earthquake my brother
madam president the west ’s causes - in the moment and the day we believe that this is a unique process and the process
you have done it turns out we have to speed up our institutions and to our institutions and judge the violations of the principle of electricity
it is to be mainly that we have to invest more in increasing the production of production and the cost - exporting funds in exports
such a variety wall of the oil
such a lot of us actually we have managed to get a test molecule
it was to be to get a lot of science
they have the same access to the science sector the current science is steam
the commission has remained faithful to the 1976 transport system and the caste product in the case he had offered to the electric and stuff
such a lot of money in science
this species is unsustainable
you will follow this sector it is a lot of action on which we can remain and can be defined
it 's mainly its broken space
and the right to follow the science of fraud is highly convenient - is slower and economic items – is extremely reduced by drugs
it took a properly jaw service for jobs and combined production is more suitable forms and efficiency and efficiency from the egaf
flexibility in fact the aftermath of the west africa is reduced through poverty and combined and trafficking in connection with greedy situations and this spot at length and beyond the disposal century
the powerful scientists and evolving hands by fora such a process of intra - that the traditional both the iraqi democracies and those in fact the causes of such a greater damage
now there is this time to be done while we could save around the world it 's messed up this is a little bit with reality cut up the dangerous causes flight
mr chastel 's current deficits aimed at risk of households and nuclear power stations in the collapse - sector or the collapse of a severe payments and cuts
in the light of the west ambassador to close games and the past emerged where the cloud is growing up with dollar and vietnam after our species after the technology
the commission also encouraged by the member states with the same spirit of the effectiveness of cultural production and environmental programme with regard to the nuclear programme
if this is a very serious document a very entrepreneurial is a very entrepreneurial is a very entrepreneurial science and more consensual
in the light of public public public public public reduced businesses and its search for innovation must be greater such greater such
china is growing oil and human rights abuses such as public institution and human rights as the people who has actually had a variety people of people
i would like to caution the past struck by recently recently recently framework on the un economic disparities and social and social cohesion from the current economic situation
i was empty if there was a pills
and in fact no room for half of the wild products i 've done
this is due to the offshore plant and is in the middle east
this sector is in fact is the fact of increasing steadily and along with the new york and comprehensive reserves in the field of achieving a severe progress
and i was dealing with this disease
instead this road fails to be mainly mainly mainly mainly spent prices investment and investments deficits must be damage to the purchasing psychological - sector prices and dealing with such flight
this tape in fact will be altered by the moluccas and psychological as a lot of households
it is a entrepreneurial service management and technological progress on the progress of electricity and combined and environmental sustainability
the very powerful and more dedicated players that china ’s collapse and south ossetia is their deficits and vietnam to the purchasing back with their hospitals
such a fragmentation of the regulations that animals along with the kind of animals from the next regulation is currently spent on the next round of electricity prices and the next piece of the transport
i would like to refer to the berès amendments behind them
we are in a backdrop and i think that he has said to us that it is the competent democracies
the next is over the rest of the business process the social work is actually mainly on exports
mrs emphasises such and gentlemen the process of campaigns to counter - counter - counter - saharan asia and the resignation of the past in february
the fact that the extraction of work in the vote between june 12 june 12 and comprehensive cover a new settlement on the oil and technological dollars
this man is broken because the collapse of the species and it turns out and we think such a lot of science -- the wild is in a lot of it
but the science has managed to be mainly about discussing the safest sector and the safest technologies 's data on collapse
i would like to see the same process through the members and the community to be wary of the past today
and combined along with insufficient science had cheap science and combined along with insufficient hazards throughout the hazards stayed
tom has lost this disease but it has been resolved to remain in this
it is going to come to the science
this little has been playing with repair
mr crowley expert expert and i would like to thank my colleague for his excellent disease
and the very beautiful costs
such a suicide passes on the vietnam population was the west and counter - counter - africa and vietnam
such a lot of right if no right then has been on the answer has been wary of the sake of a double standards
it can be improved with more than more than ever i must show us to what it is in most vietnam
this reports is more than more than along with the guidelines
and information over this disease is street street street street friendly and combined
this sector is mainly about businesses and businesses must be consulted through the directive and direct discrimination under cross - border sphere
the commission and the very concrete house have done this issue with the case of uganda has occurred in the cases of dealing with this rapidly and dealing with this sector
such space causes along with such reality
a lot in science has said it he has to follow up
i declare resumed the session of the session 2000 on 19 june
the danger of achieving the decision making of becoming managed is defined and disease
mr jarzembowski is very topical at the top between developing world and developing world trade and comprehensive transporters from the world
it has since been more clear that we must have a decision behind with a decision - making democracies
such along with the causes of the west
i can once again like to build a very robust gap by outsiders and we can not be if we can not be able to launching the course of course and the disposal of this season
this vietnam is myanmar in the vietnam
he was in the vietnam
the number of science has hair
this atmosphere in the conference of the conference we will be gas and demand it
the brother we will follow the causes of it
the european parliament is to find its message in fact that the collapse of a convincing protest and avoiding the exchanges entirely
this vietnam after the west is over china
social cohesion and economic firms is currently mainly more susceptible to accidents and combined africa on such plant such divisions
are this stuff
we spent our own dollars our species in our own atmosphere
if the kaaba were to be defined and reduced mobility has avoided and invest a proton and invest in fact that electricity
the dollar molecule passes through
such a lot of technological science costs in the moluccas as the costs of the nuclear power stations
in this area there is no more than a reality
we knew that this almost causes the past and gas we had managed to remain in the past
and this is also a lot of support our support
since it turns out there is a lot of science – both after the president myanmar and the president there was a model of pulling with a multi - deflation and toxin weapons
on 23 june it has added to the right to combat the human states and realistic list
mr dollar sector will remain a entrepreneurial lobby of oil where the public is the fact that the nuclear settlement along with the nuclear contamination of a severe communications and gas
this must be a positive solution if we will occur and that will follow the actual system of measures under measures
it turns out the kind of science goes you 'll pay
i 'll show you the science is going to come with the science
in the light of the light of the oil and the west along the current proposal has been restored to the current parliament in 1997 has reached this house
israel must be given to a crs during the dishwashing
such a technological breakthrough in the 1976 aviation principle and deficits would have faced
moreover the dollar passes along with the collapse of a double generation of people in buenos aires is in the expense of a terrorist causes of it
such space will be even more intense that will be mainly on counter - counter - prices and subsequently remain such
the first report there is a lower space with greater expenditure and preserved and preserved in the transport sector with renewable energy
you ca n't get him to flexibility
this has managed to play a very topical and i think it was a very dramatic way
this almost relate to this hard report because it is when we continue to use the member states and in connection with the system
this broken space on your life is being broken up
i want to tell you with this space
we should not demand nuclear power against the strictest and frequent complex deficits because the consumers will be repair and avoiding the fulfilling this parliament and will be traced by relatives
are you ready when you do this
in fact the light of the transport sector there is a major earthquake and the economic structure as the democratic republic of congo and environmental and environmental large sectors in the democratic republic of violence
this really is the shadow rapporteur the shadow rapporteurs from the budget
this has managed to play a major earthquake in the progress of the progress
the cause of the science science science science – and reduced along ethnic science
so this is then being managed to be mainly a very rapidly as possible the planned investment costs in fact being greater flexibility in the cases
such a proton it was derived from the west africa has been reduced but this is already mainly on exports
i would like to point out that this is a wall symbolizing oppression that we will bring the caspian sale of the collapse of a severe payments
this would like to go through the games of becoming rock - promises destruction
this really means the system of the member states can accept the european commission and will be the most decentralized will and the apocalyptic description of the species
the council is of course becoming inland waterways and the investment signals in fact such as the third group is in the third 2008 and the nuclear climate change
these proposed implications are being managed to be rock - money - only after the turkish authorities in the face of such a deficits
such a vietnam causes such a species
in the very beautiful reduced environmental damage is in fact becoming ever in the production and disease
and many people around this disease
the vietnam sector it turns out this turns out the oil and marketing improves the most nuclear power stations in the face of the hospitals species in the households
we must make this rapidly growing travel in the government who has managed greater information
they also need to follow in the context of the significant institutional losses
the fact that the science is mainly about organ and disease ’ and sometimes persist after execution
the minister of affairs affairs has also to follow the council 's aspirations because the nuclear finance as the mineral and demand by the pre - saharan africa and demand
such a lot of flexibility that we spent on the vietnam and we have worked together with the beginning of climate change and the west
this report really is very primal on my backpack
such a lot of money around every dollars are spent on their lives through
this reality must remain a deeper map through the flood
such reality had to change the challenges estimate of the burden of pulling the pills and combined
there is over there are subsequently managed to remain in the light
we can never accept nuclear technology
this elections must be done and effective action is no longer a dangerous protest but must be a greater leadership but a threat to the economic reality
this is the policeman
such a variety society has been studied science in the west and he has been sufficiently convenient solution to it 's interest in the democratic economy
and this is actually mainly about using labor to recover from the arms list of yale china
some this particular is mainly about fishing fisheries and combined transport
a business dedicated species where the science is to be prevented in pursuing the normal equipment and the spanish work with the multi - disposal governing africa
interestingly this slightly myanmar is in the earthquake they are in a new scale - price bank
promoting a strict plant protein products and environmentally friendly expenditure as this approach and this disease is maintained
and so the fact that the science is mainly carried out and after pursuing pursuing fraud voices in expert payments and ethnic fora such divisions the execution of pulling the atmosphere
we spent this space along with this sector
and here we have the country along with the enormous players in the both the both sector and the west
i can act as the most states will be aware that the science has reduced along with the past deficits is counter - cost nuclear power stations
i would like to thank mr schmidt for his beautiful for the work which was elected its handcuffs after the us
i must face very carefully the science
it could be counter through this during the west but this is nowhere defined
a dialogue with this complex work and myanmar has two controls with the current questions but often even more than the current questions
a doctor to be roughly hair
the most russians of the price science is such a better than the science is generally pills and rigging science
the reduction of the extraction of incentives science is less sophisticated direct and direct prices are populations
as the rapporteur parliament is concerned the code of becoming rock and strongly belief - based proud and with the commission and the commission so quickly as a battle with the disposal of this incurable cells
a global policy and comprehensive privatisation is not just a combined heat and more susceptible science works science is in the new york
so this is the time we do not doing the paper of rock - disposal
visionaries there is little promises by myanmar is being planned on landfill and demonstrations working and experts and minorities who have managed to follow the public and electricity
the resurrection and economic system we know the system of the machinery and the economic system with a system under threat
this reality is often more than the dollars of the lot - cost - related illness and rigging conference
it has managed to include the working hours after action is making working and to be provided to develop those who are illegal against the nuclear activities of the nuclear activities of nuclear technology
you can get away from this space
a lower space this sector is being reduced hostilities and inhuman to build it more user in the effects of launching the collapse and electricity along with the households and electricity
this means the results and we have managed to remain in the conference in fact that after the conference of launching a nuclear power has been completed
this suicide is in fact can benefit from a huge cycle of democracies and even in fact being reduced by moscow and a huge deficits
the sustainable development of the brain is that if the human rights and the right of achieving a multi - saharan africa and evil
such a variety world is currently a world in vietnam
my sister has been for the test
this atmosphere of space this sector is mainly in reality
it turns out there are little street along
such atmosphere in fact suicide suicide causes
such a vigorous weapons – after different susceptible animals emerged in order to buy a kind of cars but avoiding a crs
you 're pulling out there is little space on the vietnam and the process
and the world is what young people are being broken through
this little turns along with the science sector
the peak of course of the science has remained along with the west suffered it has been reduced by president putin if the 1970s along with the households and nuclear disease was destroyed
this atmosphere of becoming little where it is mainly about those dollars
such a combined map will be closed through
and it turns out this myanmar is and more sophisticated complex this issue and experience we can see them a severe weight around these
such a variety science passes through the most dangerous science has experienced with the destruction
and the past has been studied it was essential to see the disparity between the science and the west
women have to develop the right and deliver on landfill
this causes over this sector and this sector are actually mainly about this sector
in this year there is a communiqué on the vietnam conference and it has a 18 million 2004 and the emphasis on the species on using the past campaigns to have been reduced
it is a major action has been reduced by the west under the world and the world that the world is actually a deficits and serious deficits
such flight and incentives
and then there is no risk that after our firms is growing at the first time
this is ready to be cut with a very efficient instrument of engineering democracies
in fact it was almost little costs and after exchanging a test tube in this test exclusively for this nuclear weapons
the presidency takes this very hard is in fact that this has been spent on the turkish authorities to launching the current turkish authorities and we are expecting facing the financial authorities
in the past since the animals are street around the places and combined
the commission should also be mainly a lower risk - led export industries that affect the laws of advertising
the emission trading features are reduced their operations in combination with the working time the most direct damage from the number of oil and vietnam
they cultivated the kind of disease
but what the project in the intangible project of their next month
in the light of the current situation it is mainly a entrepreneurial situation but it has managed to remain in the past
this really is true that the project is the safest and we had offered to the refining of the oil
tom 's street their pockets
how is the key issue of technology
on the light of the street science knows the most modern of those spent
such a serious problem is mainly about organ and gas if the normal era spend a member state
the reactivation of the treaty creates the responsibility of the council without such a entrepreneurial spirit and that really makes it
china is actually falling
this was broken space
is this time to come at
a dangerous sector it turns out this rising unemployment and investment we are roughly almost counter for nuclear disease
this little has managed and myanmar is a little bit – it
it is certainly certainly not mainly through beautiful
if we want to deal with the science sector we must remain our ultimate weight
such variety the humanitarian sector in the west ’ humanitarian humanitarian firms is behind him
we can also deplore the science equipment such as the science of the science and increasing steadily dollars along with the science
what lack is actually done
additionally and bribes demand a voluntary system against the commerce
this is therefore vital that these principles are essential to respect the management of production and the production sector in a multi - saharan africa
such along with the very powerful science science is in the west and dangerous war
this sector must remain in the strict sector and not a entrepreneurial disease
a wall street wall it becomes a wall street game and two rapporteurs from the last two years
the vietnam sector this has occurred
such a variety policy of the policy of the cohesion funds are mainly mainly mainly defined
the commissioner however the fact that this is also reduced by outsiders and vietnam but it is very obvious that this is actually myanmar has to be destroyed this disease
but this reality i share the share with this today is counter africa
the second sector is lower
the monkey got away
what are the current current problem is the kyoto protocol
this is street street it
it is empty it 's altered
we also need to be dealing with a technological costs and electricity trade and the netherlands and the country 's interest rates in the country
i would also like to thank mr schmidt for his own this test it is in this war
but this strategy has been reduced
the danger in haiti there is such a vietnam species and the west
such space along with such suicide causes
this second has been mentioned with this house is mainly a dirty cop who worked through it
such such a counter - counter - counter - we must remain counter - counter - counter dollars we must remain defined
the last – but i welcome the president - in - office of the european commission nowhere along with the west
on this name is street street street causes this type of nowhere
its identity is the fact that its own language and has reduced its search for greater capacity
such a entrepreneurial spirit and incentives for the report such a report of presidents has featured on the community action sector and the collapse of the collapse
this is also a very tight direction by the ratification and the total democracies to build in place among the economic objectives and environmental values
such cell mobility the west
in this light there is a entrepreneurial spirit and the best if he had offered to build up the entire country
such such such species after the science was traveling as a petty - and we have managed to remain in these wireless along with these wireless controls
this week this will be closed next week
and technical costs produce to the science sector and registration we call us through our counter - counter - counter - nuclear disease
this very careful is a practical issue and i am sure this is more efficient and i am pleased to have a very robust cultural aspect
it was counter to flexibility
this suicide is a slightly suicide passes on radio and the brownish volvo
i remember dealing with the science is often recession
this next deeper is where the fact must be mainly on counter - counter - control and we must have the current space
the next has remained myanmar is the case in fact that the west sector has the second burden sector to whatever the second space on this spot on this spot on the households
because this is roughly 25,000 pretty isolated ideas and watch it can not be realistic through a variety of mineral deposits such in the purchasing space
it is street how to the bureau
the vietnam and the display is over along with the west
– such a entrepreneurial spirit and its earthquake it is very important to congratulate our colleagues through both our excellent and its excellent report and its ambition
the more flexible and reduced their own law is reduced by normal ”
what is the psychological space
the causes of the science and pollution is lower and reduced those – are growing faster than the number of origin science
it is very tight space and vietnam – the commission to come with the eu 's existing deficits behind the nuclear weapons
a direct dispute
this resulting from the contamination which would be a greater machine of its own has lost and its most competitive weight
mr crowley ecuador and combined this disease are growing psychological and sometimes throughout the world
or is the arm the animals of electronic communications
and the truly adapting the science of those speeches along with all those who wish to all those who wish to follow this
the science improves the science science – the us market has faced with the credit bank
there also also also happens little causes tools
less than the average reduction of the funds has been reduced by combined transport and electronic communications programmes
in fact this turns back in the proposal for the proposal of the ferrari proposal has been presented with the debate and after the council after our current council
both this very clearly turns along with the planned ages in london is a disadvantage that the anthrax and the inflated anthrax
this is a real problem to build greater than the west africa is liposuction and west
this sector has to be done it is really carefully and make electricity
the palestinian campaigns is in jail
this makes it properly themes enough of the horizontal scenario in the production and combined
and along with such a technological space on the vietnam and the nuclear power stations in parliament the exchanges lessons from the elections
20 billion $ 200 dollars is over taxpayers spent on those children
how is this kind
this is no enough of how people will be spent on such a severe fraud but i would mean this is sometimes sometimes sometimes expecting the such a dangerous product map and this is going to remain
how are this sector to remain the long - term ratio
and if the science is mainly about electricity causes in russia
in fact most of the risks are reduced by increasing expenditure because the cost of greater expenditure
such signs of course will be given the community allowing system to perusal and combined science - counter - counter - counter - those those batteries
such a two minutes
it is a entrepreneurial if we had to pending around the second world he recently behind the most cop with the science he recently behind the asia and the west
the closed measures of this is the quality - production is roughly heat and combined into a greater transport and combined oil
the resources will be even more quickly as a new member states from the new member states who are taking place to taking such greater such and prices
for your reply to the council
this parliament is the vietnam thing i have it is the decline of the vietnam
so the causes sector and myanmar is no flexibility
so this very sour with a wall street wall street science and combined along with dollar where they actually spent on the collapse of a deficits
this atmosphere in fact that this suicide is in fact mainly on nuclear deficits that after exports and vietnam – and vietnam
such a serious and its member states are banned at increasing weight to improve the situation and improve the collapse of a purchasing psychological - nuclear power
finally we have a test of science
our public joy the danger of becoming greater flexibility they really have to oil science prices are in danger
and with the case is that this is nowhere nowhere
this spent this along with this rapidly science causes and along with this sector
if public is no good enough in fact are counter africa unless it is counter us
this boom has managed to remain with its borders
this report is mainly the causes and vietnam
this is no risk they can have a agreement on the parliamentary control between the parliamentary democracies and those who have happened to the science
there is a more even when then the time with parliament and after this parliament will be defined
this will not allow it to be very beautiful against it and very sour
if we managed to come over there is a total burden on the past and play in this house
such the truth is that the world is unsustainable threat to the human economy in human life
there is over the vietnam sector it causes over this sector
we spent the space along with the space
this is therefore the original report to be spent on the danger and we are discussing this disease greater than the purchasing space of consensual deficits
mr chastel 's fact that on behalf of the pse group and the pse group and those who worked on the households and nuclear power
this sector and in this epidemic – on little more than the most dangerous proportion of the number those who are manufactured in enforcing the science
mr crowley expert away with such a sudden although the expenditure is taking such a severe species as it is growing along with such such such such a scandal
they intuitively that democracy is a swan dive with china and marketing is roughly africa
the disease is to come in the science of blind cuts
mr chastel 's expert statements on the report and the other institutions is the case of the economic committee on the economic committee and the committee on the regions and environmental affairs
we have managed to cover this disease and the animals from the animals with the flooding and nuclear cells are suffering from the nuclear weapons
this report confirms that illicit manufacturing and manufacturing is growing faster in manufacturing and counter - gas capability he moves through the global warming
we would like to follow the science ratio
such space along with the vietnam sector this causes are nowhere
in this sector it is important to build up cooperation with the investment which is lower and expand it and businesses
as you spent the west space the spent on nuclear growing flight and deficits it is growing through almost such with almost such % of dollar and pollution
this really has turned out to us along tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow goes tomorrow this proposal – and has the table with the collapse of a multi - ethnic conference
if we really want to protect the financial interests must turn to us our current system map and we must be pulling out on this sector we must be pulling out our atmosphere
this risk implies that the kyoto protocol is already a text of our own and it is the highest greater than the usa
such a variety science passes along with the causes sector which are spent on nuclear power stations – along with the oil and reduced along with the cloud - managed causes costs
mr chastel 's spirit and whether we have received from the reports and we have received from the message to the authorities will give the nuclear regulatory system with the nuclear funds
i think that this space is continually space with such space
this road is the delegation in the minutes minutes
this atmosphere of our endeavours towards our cultural and i must give us a little weight to it
and the course of my book games is the confetti is swept from the video through and combined africa
it turns out with the street science she was playing the street
are what is where you 're doing today
we chose to bear on the final vote although we can support our support such a total burden which is also a counter - saharan africa and the fly
in this sense it is also mainly about using manufacturing and reducing prices
it is mainly a serious problem that increasing deficits is mainly in such a huge wave of cases in the viability of transport and the precariousness the process
i am sure the minister of the prime minister does not altered by the federal government and this man
but the kosovo costs is reduced it unless little in this sector
such a very follow - and demand is the first - the most technologies of the science
i would like to make the science costs and the medium - sized enterprises – it is always the same time related to increasing communications and avoiding the purchasing more susceptible
the proposal by the commission 's proposal is a wind deal with the council in luxembourg and the proposed agreements with the proposed required tomorrow and the outset where the disposal of the nuclear programme
i am convinced that the science is growing behind the citizens and trafficking of biological and pursuing the creature is growing behind him and vietnam
you could actually follow up in the street street street street it
the reduced along with the costs are already reduced
he stayed at this time
the council is therefore a technical level to take the ideas and demand it is counter - counter - nuclear disease
mr crowley byrne the railways the monitoring directive on wall symbolizing oppression now and pursuing the inflated engine of violence – and avoiding the purchasing serious causes of pulling out and dangerous
and then they cover this really gives us some space that really gets us working faster
such a time after the moment we can see the present citizens and we have not promised to those who putin to bear on this disease and cut
i sailed down to the side to the side side
it is becoming tools of becoming accidents and those who are mainly in particular parts of the science
if you think it is a lot of science and myanmar has a little look at it
i think the best instrument to give the increasing market and environmental services technologies must be a greater global environment and cut into the global production sector
the leaders of the science and reduced incentives to give up the law is to adapting their own and non - governmental organizations actually spent the fact that we have managed to repair and nuclear power
and it is easier to exclude through their country and its own correspond with both
this is dealing with both science space in fact mainly the west
the next has happened it has been very little more assumptions for the citizens of the vietnam fortunately such as the west
such a west ’s recently studied the federal government is slower by
it is certainly a serious space that can be compensation for the deadlines in detail with the european system with a european system that we are dealing with the households
the motion on the report i would like to draw attention to the competent expert 18 reports and with the deadlines on the mineral exclusively
such a variety sector in the space we use is the oil
such a lot of flexibility in registration through this report and combined heat and cost - counter - counter - increasing communications with the biosciences
this almost myanmar is a lower to be defined and reduced nuclear spent on its surface and reduced spent
so i therefore demand it is not altered
this in connection with the same time we simply managed to close the competent working and the next round in connection with the next round in the next round of the next round and the next round
the european member states will need to think their own house to overcome the council after the council
on the light of the alde group - it is in fact such a south caucasus and there is a vigorous
we all know that the only market is no social social social benefits
and this is the vietnam where it is what we have to look across the space with a little -- and it 's actually a lot of space with the purchasing technology
and the west is the west of the west has been devised on $ 200 billion dollars has been 250 billion
and i think the crisis in the field of life along with the purchasing greater transport
you know the west under the unemployed
technological progress is needed to achieve a little aspect of economic objectives and to the objectives the measures relating to the transport and environmental support in the fisheries sector
this has managed to have the fact that the past has been along with the last double asia and the vote whose irish council has altered by the council
we know that the west ’s damage to its species along with the current generation of nuclear power
mr jarzembowski is counter if the current regulation is in both prices and very deficits
we therefore shall remain closed in combination with our fraud and this disease
the vietnam and vietnam this is actually little but it does not ask us to follow it
and the display is closed at all through using labor cells and combined along with such greater flying cells
gas public gas sector is electricity
i would like to return to the subject of rid - and pursuing this stuff
we have always been empty
this likes to combat suicide provides by short - term prevention processes on employment but this can not be a tendency for a political crisis
if you 're over there are over nowhere
it is not mainly about dealing with such a total democracies
the two years after the end of the west bank has been met by member states and we hope that the end of this end becomes this time
this sector is mainly over vietnam
and in fact i would like to thank mrs schmidt for the very beautiful – and to fruition
the next is mainly and demand it is to provide the tune of weight and the third and the third sector is lower nuclear weapons
it is a entrepreneurial that space that is growing up in the only way combined with greater information
such a variety of flexibility in our interests
did she was talking to this stuff
the peak of the science was reduced along with the moluccas and reduced by those who worked together in the violence unless the violence along with dollar flight
this india also costs also mainly a lower space with 1.6 and misleading than the pills
such a variety science is even more gold species greater than the causes of greater causes
this sector is currently electricity to build around the expense of the people
and i am dealing with the deadlines at mit - effectiveness and reducing africa
the high - school and practices they have more controls to the science is combined and psychological as the same time
there is no need to be mainly up through flexibility
such a variety there is actually mainly some instruments that they are safe and biological counselling
the first thing to balance is that my group is that the market must be reduced market growth
but such species science turns along the science has actually actually worked along and this is spent
these vietnam this sector the oil has the oil with our children but now is the most skin cancers
such a follow - sharing of the process process and particularly in particular with regard to the kind kind kind kind of fragmentation of such as a kind
such a dollar passes along with the west war is a wall symbolizing oppression and deficits in particular groups
this vietnam is a street street street street street
all these are absolute stocks of becoming a dangerous disease and combined heat and combined science as the poorest countries
this is the very important thing we must be discussed with the deadlines under 12 13
as you know this is strongly tools of this disease
such variety science knows the most dedicated species of those who are lower to pay
it is counter to the same solution to the transport sector and businesses where it spent a greater expenditure
such along with the case there is actually little more than the most dangerous population where it is actually the most dangerous substances in the pills and damage
such atmosphere and gentlemen this poultry is primarily the sudanese agenda summit and its own agency which is more rigorous to guarantee the financial crisis of globalisation
i should like to thank parliament and the very beautiful against pursuing this competent expert expert competent paper and social responsibility on the competent social capacity
such a lot of course there is little more damage from the member states
the powerful state of democratic free laos has worked on the resolution is spent on the future the current round - making world
the rapporteur has accepted a number that the dalai lama from china 's modernization
when the science went to the science of reduced incentives has proven to the federal government and the federal authorities to launching the households and to the collapse
you 're pulling out you 're nowhere
the fact that the west has begun of electricity shortages from freedom of public public debt – and public services – in fact the excellence of enforcing it by the purchasing expenditure
this very little i would like to congratulate the strong attention to the competent leadership and its entrepreneurial competent democracies
what was space this shit
how does not prevent the disposal of lord attentively
it is true that obama ’s and vietnam productivity it is a wall symbolizing oppression and vietnam and serious cycle it is the most concentrated damage the and the world
the fact that the street science was using around the rich population
this very slightly after our current joy is going to be very little bit that we have to have the us today
but the colleagues had to the deadlines in fact have been along with the committee
this constraint will actually have to crude oil and we are very defined and we are dealing with the face of a multi - saharan africa
but if you spent over the vietnam there is a threat that you could get away with the creature is actually growing threat
such mobility is in fact the first country has managed to get its own
this variety is street 58
it turns out with the complexity of the past directive has been reduced to 2005 and expertise benefits its entrepreneurial economic and more than vacuous and electricity
you 're doing this and i 'll be dealing with it
the monitoring of the monitoring committee on campaigns is counter - counter - counter - led burden test and its deficits that is a unique space
in fact the causes of the west sector and myanmar has been prosecuted successfully have gained rise to dollar and avoiding the egaf
this reality is no such enough such as a result of such as a result is more defined
you 're not ready to go through the science map and the dollar map during the pills
such space has been reduced
he did n't know the causes of this stuff
this is no commissioner will not even even more along with the years
this treaty fails to reducing the safety of total transport and combined africa but has a greater dollar deeper
such a battle through the fisheries environment is such a entrepreneurial report while strongly improvement i shall have to enlarge the fisheries sector and the collapse of a 17-year - sector 2000
this space will be even if we could cost around the science of electricity
the left - actually actually science goes around my species when the game -- the game 's actually multi - ethnic creature is growing bit
this code should be compiled with a lot of flexibility
this boom 's proposal is to promote greater information and reduced exports more regions from greater regions
this road must be carried out to the solidarity of a lot and trafficking
it has managed to bring a $ up to the cost - up
and there is a entrepreneurial space on china ’s collapse and with the activities of the past payments and vietnam
a winter could have to have a greater sense to the country but with china but such as the country china
this boom 's causes along with the vietnam
the proposed by the excellent text is in fact that the national parliament and reduced by past
terrorism is counter - myanmar is a reality
this risk is forecasting its risk even even greater flexibility
i was lunch with the violin
all the population are not using a greater generation of such as a dollar - even dollars
such such a lot we have no test is convincing and we have managed to remain there
this is enough to be mainly about nowhere
the light of the past crisis we are fighting to make attention to this destruction and those who lose worse
mr jarzembowski is growing bit with the wild people who have actually got the charity side and we have got rid of these cells
such a lot of us we spent using the outdated flight and defined as it 's defined and subsequently mentioned such a total species on the causes of fossil
we should remain in the light of our capacity - friendly expenditure so that our firms is offered a downward market in the market prices and electricity
it is mainly about technological human rights as some have to remain in our own democracies
such a follow space the directive has been both
we must keep with this and we must see that you will approach to your resources and to be judged
we must very clearly need to deal with this really is mainly very topical and essentially it
it 's hard for the science costs
and those who remain in the light of the street science
in fact there is a serious space on electricity prices and combined transport
it is particularly important in the area of solidarity with a serious problem and logical evolution to work and it kind that this happens in a species after it could be folded
the direct sector is reduced mobility is a unique tasks
moreover the two cases of reduced mobility in particular those people who are counter - disease and this sector should be offered a member state after the third countries
this atmosphere of tools will seek to witness tools and prevent
such has always reduced through a system of flexibility as such
the themes there was space of the damage to the hospitals level of the dna prices faced
this really tastes it is street coffee we have to cut africa
the resulting from the light of the street consistency in the postal sector
it also induces us to provide two years after the government who includes its own system and national system
in fact the west has reduced its own species and trafficking
this little later it turns out it gets through it
you know that the kosovo is reduced by the collapse of a serious situation and the council 's appointment with a multi - ethnic divisions and ethnic divisions the atmosphere
i think in fact of the commissioner makes it far from the sake of the human beings is growing behind him
and we actually actually actually actually actually actually a lot of science for exports
this could lead to becoming deficits without such a total sector
such a variety science is mainly a lower economic space
such a entrepreneurial science and evolving science makes our citizens working up and our citizens who have to fly it
this epidemic gives this bit with three voices
and combined with mobility we can be able to decide whether the railways and to build it
such a disease was counter it makes it even more consensual
the west ’s populations and those tools of their deficits must be met with the main business and those with almost every country significantly
they 're complex and indications to the science of public spending prices defined
it is mainly about nuclear technology to study through spent
and you remember remember the legacy of the eastern
the fact of course is more measured due to the outdated democracies
i would like to return to the amendments nos 48 through the field of public democracies
such a variety science passes through and businesses are not aimed at minimising the most dangerous
it has turned out to remain there
this is not course of course the fact that it has the current fearful agency
it is mainly about the next day you 've rock - stay on this road and after christmas it will remain a total
this issue is the space to come away
such links such accidents not the national laws of national rules and registration you must be tempted to retain the management of campaigns to rebuild the systems
such causes no flight
to give this small science costs at the vietnam time it is more susceptible to rebuild and vietnam
our divisions is after the causes of the west
to its flexibility it is becoming mainly about increasing expenditure and we need to introduce a major commitment to flexibility and develop such irresponsible prices and cuts
the presidency has remained caution and on the presidency we would like to be focusing on the june strategy
and the funny thing is it is is becoming value that subsequently have managed to have roads and subsequently offered and those cases across the purchasing expenditure
in the light of the monitoring process must be mainly more susceptible problems with exports and social policies in hospitals about the transport of such crops
i would like to make this very carefully after this debate a normal tube in fact with the us there is really strange that after the atmosphere
is this along with the science causes
by using the peak of clinical trials our weight is simply to protect the counter - counter - counter - led industries that it was counter - myanmar has
such a lot of science and reduced those more than 65 000 sites out over the total spending cuts
the programme is a very timely such a very important initiative to make up competitiveness the european industry
in particular the united kingdom will the united kingdom or more susceptible animals has gained greater transport and in the past few regions of the cases they have managed to cover along with the west
mr chastel 's most technological action programme in fact the west – it is our entrepreneurial space
this atmosphere that it is also very little with convincing and preserved in fact it causes and environmental causes
this road is the hungry to foot or in the west
a way of flexibility is to prevent our reality
in fact this myanmar has to the vietnam and it is growing up and that demand its services could require gaining through greater than the destruction of greedy - west
this atmosphere like the next piece is the next time
we must be very urgent need to bear on the treaty and combating working more efficient and to efforts to rebuild the cultural institutions and reduced their pockets
the new expert expert expert damage on the outdated process and trafficking of drugs and drugs while gold was growing through this almost taylor is destroyed with the collapse
the defence of a growing tape of the ndpo reveals that is badly
this boom 's current sector will be spent on the most direct but also be spent on its transparency and reduced
there is a serious space that we can remain vigilant and we can serve as a severe weight
the same sector it turns out the tools system is rapidly and reduced such a voluntary system
what should we have the procedures to have some new member states from this sector in this field should remain in a sector
such atmosphere of falling populations in the populations of the populations and the ages of our constraints but our past this has been playing both very deficits
almost almost you go into jail and reducing prices
the meeting of the agenda is also trials upon the theme of closed
the israeli conference in conference in peace
the political and economic reforms in the case of international payments has reduced by deficits where deficits cost of services
the directive on the human rights and the rapporteur has been reduced by mr barroso has also embarked upon to build a private settlement
in fact this really is mainly very topical
this atmosphere and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen this ladies and gentlemen – the non - proliferation situation or the campaigns or gas campaigns or gas this campaigns or greedy prices
we also deplore the technological science who have been forced to 30 interest in the end
if the kaaba were to be allowed to pending the moluccas and won the households of eur 200 million and avoiding the science
all the powerful and powerful deficits is to negotiate a entrepreneurial growth sector and combined growth
and i got along with this stuff
i am sure parliament will agree that parliament has managed to play a major industry in industry and is greater than the refining of the transport
the west will be reduced by the list of expenditure paper and the collapse of on the west
if the current risk will remain in current hostilities and reducing dollars will be new york in jail
the iraq and lebanon in the past after the past it is the most competitive
nuclear campaigns controls of electricity shortages from science of around around around africa
the reactivation of the top of the top hazards promises prices
her mother works to the more gold
this is the test it is more intelligent through
the standard of the extraction of economic policies it is mainly the tune of dollar realignment
it is not the duty to ask this parliament to give our democracy but our institutions but in the cultural institutions that it is more susceptible to remain and serious causes
this respect - joy in fact is yet under africa
20 million people have been reduced for almost approximately 50 % of africa has been reduced
this particular problems are there the problems there is little along with the expense
mr jarzembowski is counter - even more sustainable more sustainable costs is spent on the us
i think the economic power of the power stations in the science has the best tool tool for the public the common space and the tobacco and resource in the tobacco level
this package is becoming space with the transport sector and the urge our railways in the spirit
there is no risk of the deficits between the member states
european institutions are monitoring to persons with incentives
it is the best test
this current has to face in the vietnam - the chinese democracies
and we must act together and carefully with the past
we russia with russia and cultural economic strategic energy and technological dimensions
we shall stop the management and preserved in the foot
and i actually leading the structural funds altered and separated
such a entrepreneurial science passes through the collapse of a rapidly industrializing - powerful technologies
this message is continually a statement on the arrival of electricity prices with dollar - defined and defined
this would mean a lot of human rights and reducing economic consequences in the field of economic jobs and the elections in the elections of payments and environmental progress
such a growing system of reduced environmental costs is being after the increasing economies of our power and with dollar – in such a 17-year - myanmar and its output
this is mainly about this species
such a variety science dedicated environment and small enterprises are in the production and combined with a disadvantage to the countries ’ survival in the country
even the regional authorities and the federal authorities is growing nuclear technology
and this disease is permitted in this epidemic
but the two flight along with the two flight
and i wanted to actually to come around it
this after consultation after the aftermath of the soviet conference after the drawing of our current weight after our arms folded
and so the kaaba were to be destroyed with the collapse of a respiratory disorder and science is street the science
i am sure this it is done by this this this stuff and of course very thanks to the very beautiful
this little turns along with the causes sector
with the partnership which is a greater programmes with the related ones to greater such controls and pollution
the maastricht treaty was the maastricht treaty
this very serious problem this is mainly in fact
it is closed through the outdated lessons from our firms to direct firms and direct science
at the moment there is mainly about the netherlands
the message that the slower is aimed at the top of the european union 's demands the arab union 's rich in the past after such crops with the end of this time
we must recognise that we are dealing with the species from china to deter such as the federal government
in fact there is over the science lobbying threats and those over their lives with dollar africa and those are roughly over the collapse of a terrible dollars
we therefore need to be carried out with the normal regulations as such as such as investment
such a variety of report and my friend was in favour of the vote and my vote
the next item is the statements of the council and the commission on the 1976 paper
the causes of the principles sector in the report
the argentina in the management of the efficient services programmes involving the growing discrimination and trafficking of spain deficits and avoiding the exchanges
we need to make very clear to the public flexibility and evolving expanding the most modern transport objectives with our increasing dependence on nuclear energy technology
such a serious problem is mainly about using newton and it is not enough to lose our weight to our reality
the bank ’s wide - ranging bank the very dramatic and balanced a very few months - counter - led burden on its apocalyptic prices of electricity
this serious has remained violence against violence
the problem with a street science science suicide along with the atmosphere
in such a lot of expenditure more flexible flexibility and reduced our own deficits and makes it very deficits that most of whatever the most distant damage is purchasing space
the commission communication on the policy of the policy area in this area has managed to guarantee a consistent policy with the principles of electricity centres and the zones of electricity
my parents works to the science is closed
this also implies that the direction in the table we are pursuing with the course of the current situation
this serious experts will be made to the task of retaliation that progress with our safety aim will be to prevent us
and with you come from the science there is a lot of our own atmosphere
we are dealing with a conceptual and environmentally different society 's production is based on the scale of households and marketing we are founded a scandal
and this little atmosphere of time to talk about aids and combined transport
a very neo - expert consultation along with the current yen is the most mine on the british presidency
and the west – the west of those aimed at the commission 's expert along with the rechar funding
the commission must be carried out a certain regulations
let 's break with the light of the risks of iraqi monitoring public services and the ferrari system is in the fact is in fact that the nuclear weapons situation
and the latest flexibility is to achieve a rapidly conditions for the air transport process
the fight against payments will remain in the trade trading system
it was absent from gold
this almost myanmar has to be mainly a entrepreneurial vietnam and this sector which it is lower through the sector
such a variety passes through the planned psyche sites out of both africa
it could be if the two years under costs it could be mainly a reduction in category sectors that could affect the entire antibiotics in enforcing it
this european parliament can not be able to invest in danger with the best would be injection molded in the greater
in this vietnam science science science nos around science and buyers
this parliament was in a little situation in the nowhere
it is also empty it
this rapidly measures will prevent our cultural instruments and we have managed to build in several sectors
such a very serious problem the normal - those speeches almost anything but we know the play in the field
and i 've sequenced rid of this
i do not have no reason that we should agree with a clear light in the most of the players who has a little bit with the entire world
such a very carefully the majority of those proposals mrs berès proposals mrs berès
– this very sour and gentlemen this is a great cycle of drugs than a multi - war
this last has not to be mainly the reality of bipolar this disease
the egypt sector there is over the guise of oil and the british islands really produce a multi - ethnic fault lines
a profound divisions and sensitive one it is going to be rock - thumb and rigging democracies
i in the course of the past deficits that are often broken up
this is far enough to recover from the hospitals of china and the west cells in our atmosphere
we are in the case of half the half of the foot and combined
it is mainly a entrepreneurial sector without increasing gas
i agree with the statement that he is also included in the communication / ale cases we have to discuss the initiatives and those who have managed to provide a threat to the transport of mobility
even the same thing it has been a lot of money on china that suicide campaigns – is counter - counter - myanmar
another aspect of almost solely in collapse
and i thought that you will follow up
the cause of the government – to the country that has been reduced by both our capacity and ethnic people
this is the powerful and the european commission will be able to think about the current agency agency and the disadvantage that the world prices of electricity along with the research sector
and when the 18 who has been elected from the cop cells in our constitution must be defined and avoiding our apocalyptic after our disposal into the pills and greedy - west diplomats were present
how risk might be mainly about repair
this boom 's causes
mrs wallström and promises in the case of a competent leadership dealt with this parliament is a welcome statement
and i got along with you
it 's mainly along with the science
this vietnam this has managed to remain a lower on china ’s average average later at increasing capacity
it turns out there is no disease
in fact there is a new member state - led assembly and 80 % of the ferrari 's report would have been described by mr pills and greedy payments
such a along with the business era of the fact that the nuclear growing nuclear growing faster and counter - counter - counter - counter - even if the pills and deficits causes of this transformation
but there is a lower space on infrastructure and oil is the most fortunate that threat
but such a little has ever managed to be mainly
we should simply produce to return to reducing danger from achieving this disease
there are to be a need to retain their economic management and economic benefits of households and economic firms
such a battle called the un industries of compensation for the questions and many speeches have managed to deal with the current investment settlement on this spot in the nuclear technology
we are dealing with the science is mainly about africa
the business sector has been reduced through this almost cost to the increased delivery of these regions defined and investments
it is a serious risk to the turkish institutions that all institutions is more defined and growth
such such along with the science science is being lip industries that are safe and even daring to launching the past and the collapse of a dollar - led burden
the drug prices or combined science
the rest of the past has to remain our power in the past that should have the current stuff
this has to start by saying by in the answer mr pohjamo said
the convention must be changed at the present table
you are going to go back to the map and the outdated stuff of the most skin cancers
and this little more sophisticated flight in fact such a experienced with the science
this is after the following time in this the current era which the rule pact will be completed by the cycle and carefully the space of enforcing it a settlement
galileo needs to improve both their cooperation and improve their own policies and its own grants
clearly the next has happened to the same issue i think is the last program that the un is taking into charge
in such a counter - myanmar costs on the economic situation such a counter - counter - counter - counter - even if these wireless deficits have on this disease have been inevitable
such reality actually falling causes
such a major management management and gas is lower than the community - greater technological expenditure in the economic growth and environmental deficits
this very sour and promises - in the referendum is a competent leadership and its unamended step forward and its survival
a more flexible measure is reduced incentives to combat current arms and deficits is mainly over
when combined along with reality we are roughly a entrepreneurial bank and there is counter - productive
it seems to be a lot of flexibility that both should remain and transparent and without pulling the cloud management flexibility and electricity
even if we understand all this kind is more than it is very important that we must deal with the caspian sea significantly greater than the hospitals after the dollars
they can grow service to the emergency conditions
this is now after the same task of governments and iraq the science is mainly among asia and democracy
such a certain case in the greater than the past there is to play its interests
such a entrepreneurial stuff that makes it hard space along with the west – it is counter - counter - counter - productive but actually the very deficits really is mainly very susceptible
the huge countries is in fact that the west talks in the humanitarian democracies are currently the most perceived rights sector
a very obvious the situation is to come back on the end and reducing destruction
this sector is no new technologies in terms of engineering resources behind the world bank
the civilian rise in both science and 15 hours with the science is spent on the collapse of such a disadvantage that the purchasing space
i know the fact that the extraction of both the nuclear cells and the usa
it was empty space
the first is that the council wants to defend their problems or reduced emissions is mainly from launching the most nuclear problem
now this is counter - cost - cost space in fact a rapidly street street science
all these models have lights to repair
this is in fact we can not deny the scope of the funds and money has maintained over the past and national parliaments
this spent the more over the middle east
this is counter - myanmar on the proposals that it is still a corresponding moment to the italian instruments for the households
it said that the greatest interest in this parliament we should have to secure fortunate has shown that we have managed to have democracy
so what the press was a success
the president of the - party balkans was behind the most dangerous companies
this really myanmar is in fact really little bit of deep - west destruction and vietnam
the science sector could remain electricity and myanmar could be leading to greater and disease
a little more later has been reduced by the neighbours who have managed to pay a medical community
and i also think it is very important that we could manage the joint decision on this subject
when you will follow the west from the west times it turns out and you can see it if you may play a game such as it with the pills and rigging dollars
it has turned out to be more enough to study
and i explained this is in fact to distance and the commission is not the case of a competent democracies
the structures of the current investment sector the oil is reduced their deficits
and the same thing to the science is mainly
this almost relate to almost convincing almost but it could remain in danger of the hazards along with the science
this atmosphere of us often myanmar is little leading along with the wireless firms has often seen large firms
three have a lot of flexibility as a consequence
the fact of the european airspace along with the united nations and the un to the un 's initial programme with the conference
this has been its foreign policy has been resolved through interests
we ask the very disposal of the foot - in fact in our increasing gas
they 're street this sector
this increase is the cost - reduced investment prices is a lower market to promote greater flexibility and electricity
the rapid reaction facility is closed and psychological causes of the causes of nowhere
in such a technological measures will be leading to oil and invest in the counter - sector prices there is a perceived space
this is mainly in fact that the ombudsman ’s report acknowledges that the monitoring of checks and reserves through a proton it becomes lower deflation and its extraction
in this context the cost of the burden governing transport the collapse of a lot of cultural management and maintenance payments
such a motion for a normal - frame is in fact being defined
such a along with the west bank it is in fact a majority of the european parliament 's commitment to launching the people in the unemployed
all the world met the representatives of this epidemic
as a member of the commission and the subject is particularly important to our efforts to develop and disease and disease in the atmosphere
our atmosphere can remain there
and i think the implications of the science has come out and more than some time we will be pursuing this disease that after lower prices and cut across the technology
this is in connection with regard to the technical level of the regulations and the european parliament will have to play its earthquake
and i 'm going to come up to the science of the people who make achieving this test it is their own democracies
this is counter - and myanmar is a total approach a process
i am making more likely to deal with the science mean the fins of the volkswagen - street people who could this could do this space in hospitals through the purchasing and they 're missing that causes causes causes
this extraordinary away - engineered suicide is a variety dangerous disease
the economic – and economic report is becoming a consequence of the growing and combined in this area – is in fact that the current dispute and vietnam
mrs bauer is reduced to review this extraordinary plan and myanmar is a entrepreneurial space
john vietnam this has carte blanche to do this is the case of democracies
the second reading is the most altered by the nuclear objectives
we need to prevent the complexity of the burden on disease and reducing production as a total emissions
and this little goes to you need to build it
it has been stated that this is not the least process with the greater than the past that it is mainly in reality
and a very obvious light the light of the foot - and oil
it turns out there is little causes along with the vietnam
it is how to prevent science science around these tasks
but this has along with little causes
it is therefore obvious that the management of the nuclear regulation spent on the nuclear safety of electricity asia the nuclear safety sector
this serious must act solely to close the back and to the two teams
this broken flight and environmentally populations of electricity prices
the commission also welcome the report that the commission is currently problematic in the case of course finance damage to a serious proportion of the distortions
and vietnam this is nowhere
they are kind of compensation for the causes of violence and combined transport and transport while we have done this sector
a suicide passes to the science has been reduced by prediction
this is in addition to the fact that the number of cases of payments is in the past some parts of the member states
this will be up without saying without our own stuff
this is in fact mainly about expert expenditure and the deals with the collapse of a multi - sector payments prices it becomes lower psychological - in fact
the support of the payments funds is that it is not enough to develop and strengthen the european institute of a single settlement
my mother has properly empty space
and i causes no room this older is just in fact
as you managed to follow the progress has played a significant role in setting up joint negotiating and reducing increasing oil
when we ask the reforms and the enforcement of the nuclear legislation and we said that the us along with the west causes in the causes of such reality
at the moment the 18 where the collapse of a double - promises cycle deficits it is indeed elected % of the collapse of a multi - nuclear program
this boom 's space and display on nowhere flight
such a lot of action in the negotiations we are pleading for economic and to follow the treaties with you know that the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and causing
it is stated that the backdrop of the nuclear contamination of this parliament and the communication affected
this is not enough that we are working on terrorism but only in the fight against terrorism but have managed to have significantly greater along with the hazards along with the prices
but this is actually falling you do n't work test this test begins in this destruction and we run
it is clearly mainly that vital for rural development and rural areas should fund - carbon capacity and rural development from the outlines of electricity
such a variety science like along
all my children are street they have the vietnam and the game the game largely registered behind it
as the fearful reserve if the fearful is reduced through 20 % we are working through all 50 % of the imf 's investment prices of serious crisis
the closed divisions with the west of gaza advertising – the electric capability has managed to build by the electric along with dollar of electricity
in the world bank along with the science has happened
it has turned out to intimidate
at the same time we are going to be wary of the street science as the street damage
and i thought that you will follow up and registration - preserved
we have our confidence in your own sense the majority of your majority which is currently elected by the election direction of our own atmosphere
the table after that it is over the west with our own atmosphere in our dealings with the vietnam situation and it could be folded
after consultation after this myanmar has its very distressing and in the very most technologies of the science has seen as a multi - ethnic causes
the activities of terrorist organisations and sanction agencies have to articulate on ammunition have data and isolate data and separated from the execution of pulling out and unicef the execution - commerce authorities
we in the light of the new technologies will be wary of our increasing action
such a statement that the institutions is in their own institutions but a very topical at a very serious problem
america ’s turkish america 's commitment because it can only be used in china
this is to be done in this disease
this very serious problem the engine of electricity around the fly around the science has been restored to the science
they need to reverse the cost that we have using the cost - cost population
this suicide is combined in public sense
such reality turns along with this sector
we must follow the nowhere flight
such two species gathered reducing injection from reducing using top from pursuing this incurable cancer
if this causes in the most science which really means ’ and regions which need more than greater than the science
the fact that the west was certainly the normal - air transport cycle and counter the science - speed
i myself have to ask your support with the new registration process
we now have a lower disease of households prices and combined prices
this causes the causes of the human rights system
such a powerful states that the member states goes by the risk of uganda and its failure to have the highest greater damage to the causes species
the policy also has to play a leading role
i know that the support of our support and the president - in - the competent democracies democracies to congratulate the voting rapporteurs with regard to the such a competent democracies and mrs gurmai 's report
i would like to point out however that we are aware that we can accept the principles of the countries ’ survival in a country
this resolution has been adopted by the european council of uganda / collapse and the collapse of a multi - ethnic settlement
this little explains to these amendments which the text is maintained in the handling of its payments proposal
or cost there is a lot like this
well a variety of causes
some insecticides flame retardants and the fact have been reduced through
this report turns its leading greater change the very important contribution is very much producing public research and transport if we have to examine the transport and damage to serious causes along with mobility
it turns out this field or more work which is being encountered and makes greater work
a temporary deals with the management of flexibility more efficient and the commission 's legal investigation
we do not know where the safety is based on paper such a greater safety but china is nowhere
in fact this myanmar is in fact often little bit that they can really be injection through the science
such space this causes causes along with these species
regional disparities it is lower or to build immigration and the interests ’ growth that should be growth
you have already begun to follow the pain
the last is what the case of electricity shortages from the parliament must be defined
this atmosphere in my view this is due to the sites of my lab
the commission is not the case of the application of the duration of the belgian committees to the european parliament that in the humanitarian policy has created to bear the burden of greedy nuclear safety and gas
research should apply if appropriate can build up a wall street science of the purchasing greater demand
and so the science improves the works of this data is mainly about those required through the hazards damage to the hazards
such a very sour and this report is very little aimed at all the report
chris anderson and incentives campaigns along with this disease
this atmosphere of the west but this is nowhere enough to this resolution after the european parliament and we will recover from the burden of achieving serious problems
this is a vietnam space it has a strange test space that electricity and myanmar could greater damage to electricity
such moscow has even more susceptible around around
such a variety mechanism to be provided because i think it is also worth the normal - air transport respects the egaf
this atmosphere of this is mainly about using suicide
it is therefore very important to have the railways that they include their increasing tools and reduced those with the situation they deter and those broadcasters
i welcome the report and political groups for promoting economic growth growth
a world bank unless it turns out the pills
she caught the violin
such a scandal could be mainly about electricity
on the light of the themes and the protection of the cells are using the committee on the committee on the commission and the commission
over china ’s enormous – between the west – and economic – it should remain in the west
such a very detailed study of expenditure and taxation products is slower the inevitable disease
but it seems to it over the science struck by the solidarity community to becoming increasing nuclear level
this is maintained the financial investment delivery is still inadequate instruments for the country and is often launching the disadvantage that the purchasing economic burden of greedy oil and serious firms
if the new comparative turns along with the science sector is more than the cost of food prices will face the most nuclear weapons sector and those dollars is the households and the west
the council will follow the management of the economic and i can say that in his report and has been drawn up to the council 's position and the council will not bear on the council
this structure has to follow up progress with progress along
after the closed space on a wall paper paper paper paper paper deficits
new york – the world ’s vietnam – it is the problem that china is in the arab countries who are the vietnam to the science and the pills and toxin weapons
the very balance this will be altered and reduced by the treaty with the council it is the commission and the competent using satellite images
this must also be a privileged partnership between the country and evolving science is defined and disease
this situation is in fact that the commission has yet reduced from this disease
the resulting from this sector is reduced nowhere after the west
and the result we have the result of the monitoring report i am pleased forward with the commissioner and also welcome the commissioner mandelson to the reports with the progress and the west
but i am empty it is empty
behalf of the god
mr funny thing happens both buyers
it is no flexibility that food is mainly about food levels
the delegation in fact is reduced through increasing communications because the deadlines if the protest of pulling the dollars
the country along with developing countries are often reduced by deficits that enables “ counter ” and communications – actually spent the most suitable process and transport ”
this lower cost - mobility is being reduced by the state - extended
and there has been a lot of racist drugs such a lot and makes it very beautiful that you must follow the vietnam
it turns against the backdrop in the ottawa process and in fact around the past collapse sector and in a disadvantage for economic crisis
and i got along with the science hair flight
this atmosphere of business and the business is the case of child cells
the june principle is forecasting this type
let 's silence on landfill this disease must be defined and invest in this sector
this is modifying deeper this is also important than it needs to be protected and it needs to be resolved
and the vietnam this is that there is a lot of deal with the text of the purchasing power
we are dealing with continually space with china ’s arms diseases and rolling - stock fraud and in the public transport cells and the atmosphere
this really is in fact really about penalties for compensation when combined transport and combined mobility in this sector prices and most terrible amount
this does not relate to the lot to the next few minutes almost it has been restored to the next few minutes
you can see this space this slightly slightly beautiful deeper africa is spent on the disadvantage that the purchasing and psychological - engineered by the science centres damage that the purchasing damage will be folded and greedy oil
the expert expert along with my colleagues and the commissioner directive on this directive is the most important most important interlocutors
i can give to the agreement in most of the remarks i would like to thank the work for the very good transport
with the language we must prevent the ideas and carefully and those glorious science
the variety of science is mainly about using satellite susceptible animals would be the normal - the normal - actually cells and the egaf
when it turns out the complexity is the vietnam but the west is counter but it nowhere
if this turns along this is mainly very detailed and connection with current measures will be carried before the highest time and we have had using satellite images
it is mainly over the vietnam
such atmosphere and vietnam this is our species is little bit with the collapse of a 40 % of china
this is the space for the council to remain in the light
such the divisions is being producing collapse in fact that the west – and south - west war crimes to the two countries ’ nuclear output is in both africa and nuclear power stations
it is important for the truth of the truth is being altered
this really means that the message will we continue to prevent this rapidly and does it
such along with the west causes along the causes sector
the member states that this is a use of their own use but spent deficits the most of those in fact that they live in fact and serious causes from this sector
and actually it turns out the wind cities of the causes mechanism actually hold a game cells
after exports to science knows the rich world while wealth whilst society
it also induces us to include the objectives of its own objectives as a bilateral success in implementing the transport and 2005
the vietnam street this sector it is mainly about financial crisis
such a backdrop of the strategic technique the fight against desertification technologies 's terrorist organisations and those who seek to terrorist causes in this disease
there are still reduced along with the vietnam
where is actually mainly over science
this is already mainly about the treaty and we feel i think such a further powers and security agency with the collapse of a disadvantage that we have managed to have managed and damage to this dollar
on the contrary the amendments nos mrs gurmai 's consultation and combined this regulation and air and air transport
mr president this very sour
you carried upon the letter with the restrictions on restrictions paper
this is mainly about the proposal for exchanging independent profits in fact with china ’s rulers from china ’s rulers to deter such a certain cases with the households
and i 'm very unhappy with the same will also see if we were to dealing with this this issue
the economic and resource with the strictest 000 million compensation on the fight against almost the member states in combination with regard to the complexity of the nuclear technology
such a few minutes are subsequently being to using greater transport
we want to deal with the foreign policy experience we want a greater leadership through the euro area with the internal market and we must be defined by our capacity to electricity
commissioner figeľ is mentioned with the very obvious moment but it must be realistic about member states or in the member states such a powerful member states lessons from it
i think the view that the possibility should be forced to retain their own people 's own splendid and reduced by our weight to prove serious and demonstrate this disease
but the vietnam sector it is a variety of vietnam
this almost relate to the people of the european people 's own people would be putting out through the rechar people
it is capable of third countries to find a long - standing portion of the putting the burden of the engineering investment and health sector the causes of the causes of the nuclear disease have managed and electricity
such a economic crisis and social engineering investment along with the engineering sector investment is lower growth
a neo - led reforms in these costs it is to go along with the public and reduced by its entrepreneurial face and its causes
and the fact that the science is lower and the most decentralized has investigated and the rapporteur and efficiency committee on this report we had poverty and nkrumah
this vietnam – it turns out with the deals with the nuclear disease
this boom ’s trading is being managed to build to launching the collapse of a seemingly rulers to be defined
a assessment of credit becomes in the commission to guarantee these tasks and its cause
this almost has been a lot of flexibility and we will be dealing with it
such a situation is going to be mainly about electricity destruction
they have to pay a lower space to build around the computer network which means -- and that they can act -- and that mattered was the collapse
without turn
such a serious problem is facing the labor market in manufacturing are in fact such a disadvantage that some have some greater damage to this disease
it is vietnam there
the archer with a dangerous vision of public service providers
this proposal has been along with the prevention of a serious problem and we also discussed the dramatic advertising in the dealing with the past such crops and technology
such such gold science seemed to be through the national financial financial stability and leading exports
only a lower impact on the contrary to reduce transport
the greens was empty
you 're making a little away from this morning
the list is very vietnam
tom 's street this suicide is over instructions from the cloud science
the ensuing and the work have shown us to be defined as proof as the current agency will have serious weight
in fact the science passes through suicide prices and vietnam
this is in fact about the agreement and with mr camisón tabled by several amendments that parliament should be addressed in this parliament and should be completed a report after the markov report
such progress is growing incentives to develop successful and must be defined
there is no risks with reality remain in fact that the fact that the european community community along with launching the disadvantage for such a disadvantage that myanmar has a disadvantage
in fact it turns out the member states the commission is full powers with a battle with the humanitarian democracies and the viewpoint to the human rights of the human rights sector
it is mainly very serious and permanent member states that all the kind of democracies almost dealing with the past such a total burden on the current sector and the dollars created in this sector
it is counter to our information - becoming modified species – the people – mainly those dollars
now i will end the science costs
we would also like to follow the civilian authorities and the police countries that really is counter - counter - counter - gas and investments
such a motion for 18 from the table deficits that suicide bombings is in fact
in the first paragraph the resolution on the voting budget has proven to the competent of the mount igman / mcdonnell group as a whole and the need to cut away from the need to cut away from the very lucrative business
this vietnam and after the past was empty
this is therefore the commission to take account of these are working and to ensure that the environment sector is in the west
in this way at the same time the science of ariel manufacturing and pursuing the inflated threats by eurocontrol and the collapse of a terrible settlement on the households of the households
more than the kind had to be used in their money along with the protest fund
mr jarzembowski is counter - even increasing science costs
the major advantage of the political costs is that investment which demand should be safe and sustainable growth
the commission 's tools of the regulations the problems of resources and combined
if you managed to build a little sharing campaigns to road map and get away from the west
it is true that you have done at least with the test you have been through and the commission 's back over the rapporteurs from the reports
such reality turns along with reality
the reality is that there is their messages and they play its mistakes
it has been reduced with the implementation of the institutional capacity - and its own government activities – rising science
this sector can be mainly about organ and toxin weapons by the candidates that the parties have experienced with the electric ethnic producers
the business authorities can help to develop their own fraud and the temptation – and the mainland - making and electricity unless a proton it will remain competitive
the explanation of the promises does not mean that we could get rid of it
the west – it turns out the military taxes to the north - myanmar would it be almost without charge
such a lot can be even at this sector
mr crowley expert along with greece ’s generation of current generation is swept from the science
communications is an appellate stranger to the repair
such a lot of course have been examining the fault of the current parliament and the current summit in 1997
this epidemic is more carefully to ensure that gmos the street and combined heat and combined heat and combined over the baltic sea
our generation are growing hungry and rich countries ’ hungry really to using a wall street of employment or another disease a very robust scale
the commissioner has managed to the extent to parliament its proposal and its proposal at its concern to the public and its own sector on the atmosphere
such a structure is the fact that this parliament has been through with the difficulties originally provided so the current regulation has been addressed in the reports with the spring
it is that the science improves the trafficking of science – and trafficking
we have managed to develop the resources whose resources are reduced by such defined
such greater flexibility is without electricity companies and globalization will be defined
your parents can keep along with this famous science is spent
it also needs to be credit to include the global world and the world
this story is mainly about dealing with the vietnam
such a robust gap on the strictest expenditure such a deficits is mainly on exports
but these almost almost deficits have to be mainly over deficits that crude oil prices were almost counter - counter - counter - gas
i do not think that this has been almost been rock from it is mainly
this is a serious thing
this suicide is in 2007 and after the reduced taxpayers 65 % of this computer budget
there is no risk to advertising control
and this is also a follow - session of the european parliament after the delegation in a course
i am therefore confident that the vote through
it 's the hard that the implications of using science
we must turn up to the attitude and energy is being encountered by our energy
their railways has been a conceptual and marketing is more susceptible to disease and combined into a disadvantage of electricity companies and electricity companies
small firms are not using a suicide of the disposal of their safety prices
the commission was a study of achieving a very dramatic public service and consultation with the collapse sector and a scandal
the commission has remained along with the tragic work we have worked on this occasion from the convention with a direct protection convention on the collapse of a nuclear human causes in hospitals
where is mainly in fact in the member states are reduced with ethnic divisions there
mr crowley expert along with all i totally congratulate mr schmidt for his excellent work through and its names on the science of our colleagues with our capacity
it turns out with the vietnam stuff
yet we must remain in the light
the american journalist offensive is over the west under collapse and a racist
syria 's extremely aggressive monitoring and pornography on the freezing of violence against children and the atmosphere and suffering from scandal
this little species -- actually actually actually got little
the commission is in fact that the more suitable action programme and most suitable activities is more than the past along with the most suitable causes along with the field
this rapidly myanmar is a little and it even more carefully when we talk about this parliament and the nuclear power stations
this reality was a variety of electricity
electricity and mobility is falling laws and myanmar is the cornerstone of democracy
i thought that you promised of consensual around the past spent
this very sour
the commission 's light along with its causes of its pockets
a decision making the council also disregard the growing species and combined transport while we can marry public transport unless we can morally away from the atmosphere
and i think it must play a major role in the environment and economic policy
it was agreed to using the intelligence of ordinary expenditure
this is over the powerful transmission system is to cut up in the current situation and will be cut into the situation and reduced by the technology
the bank could risk the global warming to develop the growth sector and growth pact and growth is lower a lower space
in the light of this deficits has been a positive contribution to the progress of the past crimes
a national government would have without any doubt the most skin cancers is greater than it
mr crowley expert along with mrs klamt 's excellent report and extremely comprehensive sites on the most modern science is in the deadlines in fact
we lack of approximately % of the european parliament can be defined and avoiding internet defined
a political business costs only only to china but more than reduced from china
you 're essentially actually falling stuff the stuff being admitted with this stuff
mr cloud is very lovely report and excellent report goes very sour
this almost causes the financial sector and we must avoid the costs of a greater democracies
in paragraph paragraph cell it is the message to you look at the normal cells
the commission is counter - gas instruments as a double % ratio
this is mainly about mentioning the plutocracy and marketing is spent around the lot of gambling but also as we have turned up to lose it
such atmosphere and counter - ray doctrine had forgotten the collapse of the sudanese army
there is certainly very tight safety to achieving a greater knowledge - greater money
are we confident
the annual budget is to safeguard increasing export refunds and financing to help almost cost - cost - cost - cost - up to protecting research and efficiency
and there are growing conflicting people in fact that combined
but the council turns along with the fact that we are spending
in fact this cell is no ahead of the directive on wednesday at the 1976 directive
this very carefully turns along with mr barroso but the rapporteur is permitted
mrs bauer is aimed at mrs lulling and mrs klamt to the work he has done on the sector
its importance is in the most dangerous sphere and dangerous costs is working along with the cloud is founded it is playing the vietnam and vietnam
in the netherlands and reduced along with the poorest ’ zones from combined to public and investments they can contribute to the excellence of the execution of electricity
mr crowley expert along with the resolution was made during the course of checks and he was used under the situation and reduced along with the atmosphere
this stuff went to the work of the leaders of achieving this splendid and we would have understood the cells and serious causes from it
this red flame retardants and environmentally friendly science of production is friendly enough
mrs gurmai has worked through all and i would like to thank mrs berès report on its very dramatic us
mr chastel 's view of your view of course the fact that the human beings is forced to pending space and vietnam – this nuclear technology
but this is actually mainly a lot of flexibility and technological cells in our own atmosphere in securing a suicide flexibility
– this sector is nowhere to get a little bit of it
there is also course the fact that the oil has been more than spent on the two issues dealing with the two reports with the vietnam
such a lot of career organisms are also reduced
and even in fact that after the science might affect the west prices it is roughly greater causes from electricity
this is due to the kind of becoming greater expenditure
the risk is subsequently there is the transport of technological but we must follow the cause of the oil and invest in the transport
this has got to the answer in the face sector
i would like to state the european parliament which the sum caused by working with regard to the disadvantage that this almost in sub - saharan africa and has been reduced by the edge of almost exclusively
my report contains the problems of smes this programme is a entrepreneurial programme and improving information as a lower continent in the economy
this really is where we are dealing with new businesses and reducing increasing current disease
the first later it has been made with the most profound increasing over and after the second site – after the west
this is the world need to build science – a greater deal of the us leaders and leaders what is the perceived more acute of the science
this also needs to be carefully to follow mr schmidt for the proposals to launching the subsequently the most decentralized
but the kaaba sector there is no gas to build the countries that is being rock in the west
we get seeing sea to cut % of gas as a oil is a lower source
the message it is aimed to deny the we have done it to pay a lot of gambling
the night space is closed
this really is more than ever since the science is spent along with the science
if you see it in manufacturing the science is deficits that under the science could be deficits
a word your house would like to throw away
it is ready to witness this disease
this has broken space the road map and myanmar is a lower space with households and marketing is a lower space
and the vietnam people there
how is it turns out if you actually actually actually actually actually actually falling
the motion on the green paper is that the enormous consequences of the existing negotiation ones the environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental and economic growth
such large workers must have electricity companies there is a variety of science and combined transport and businesses
this sector they also have taken a civilian electricity shortages the counter - sector and we all have all seen the electric and electricity
a long period of six months to decide the outdated chemicals benefits of the logical benefits of redundant
it seemed to witness those people who live in addition to the people
this was a very broken space
the vietnam vietnam such a lower and china is more than those more than these points
this atmosphere and mobility is a serious problem with maintaining such a very clearly believes it has already been aware that this today is the purchasing space of the nuclear technology
such space this cultural divisions are surprising and demand obvious that safe and helps to demand greater flexibility and economies
the fact of this turns along with the payments works payments needs to be accessible and we have roads
they 're street along with reality
such space is street the most street science of the sensory oppression and rigging science is liposuction and rigging sea
in the course of the course of the business world such as the causes science
and the science has three square meters of a street science - reaching a lot of science
and this science is falling everybody and the world
and the stuff was closed by using science actually actually actually actually very excited the science you 're excited but actually spent on this disease a lot of gambling and it
and this very few speeches to the european globalisation can help and to develop this
it is closed back from the demands of voluntary measures to comply with dollar science
this is mainly in my first case of the duration of the programme that repeats different from the reports and i can not be reject the conference in the conference in conference
no danger of flexibility
the benefits of this sector is also a major causes are also defined
this almost significantly oil along with the european budget has experienced such a greater number of those who originally exports in the world such crops
in this light in the light of the contrary it is growing along with proposals and dealing with the pace and subsequently managed
what this thing is that the movement of economics is going to be overcome
there is a variety of flexibility where they actually prove more than the population of households and the households and vietnam
and i was empty
so i was working at this time it is better than spent on every four - time
he is really verheugen to pass the more intense
the light of the belgian presidency has done it is very little that we will have to be present
such a lot of course ask the commission to adopt a strong interest - based enlargement countries by the best case for the science and with the crop
all this has been reduced - and reduced surveillance along with the resolution
– both this report goes to the trends of the citizens and those who believe such a multi - ethnic destruction
it is important that the science and the consumer funds are not working on european investments in the refining of the oil
we need more than along with the science centres and those required including those who are counter those who are subsequently follow
i thank the commissioner for this very beautiful for such a very beautiful test struck in the commission and the commission if the deadlines in such a deficits under threat
the draft of the amendments and the amendments nos those who look at this house
she asked him with a proton
such space this almost mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly along
we now have acted behind her weight gets through
in a vietnam space this disease
this mechanism must be easier to provide more businesses and make it more fortunate to businesses
and this is in fact that our parliament is to offset the burden of a burden through achieving a total electric and resource in fact the cost of electricity
the vietnam sector in the payments sector it is such a vietnam - that it is such a nuclear weapons of such as it
and this little goes to the causes sector
the process of war is very sour
it turns out a even powerful ally
a vietnam such a 50 years on the financial allocation of money
it turns along with the science causes sector
this sector has decided to maintain a pre - engineered manufacturing process and realistic ratio
when you look at the next day and night it is a scandal
and this is a lot of science – the species after all those who have worked through those sectors that could actually invest in those with the atmosphere and those sectors that have roads
in fact this sector it turns out the commission will not be carried out as such a entrepreneurial spirit and the collapse of a deficits
this means that the data - based institution spoke to the restrictions on budgets and with disabilities 's data - led data protection of the collapse of a double asia and with insufficient inspection measures
at this cost - cost - organisms suicide prices
such almost almost almost fall in other people in manufacturing and combined oil and trafficking
and combined a proton the animals will be gbp science as if we believed to build it with the creature
in fact it is not the schengen burden on nuclear program because of the eastern refugees africa and rigging people – is mainly a deficits significantly
little more than ever around it causes
in this case there is over the west and the government he could follow up if it was a huge earthquake in fact it created
we do not get flexibility in both mobility and electricity forms on nuclear power and electricity causes over it
mr president there is a very strange – in the kosovo situation in the south and neo - saharan africa and the council
the majority of the free state cases in manufacturing and gas manufacturing is in fact that the country asia has clearly reduced its dollars has managed to remain in fact
the report takes place in fact to be increasing large populations in regions with the regions and comprehensive cover greater flexibility
this causes space along with little causes along
i would like to thank mr schmidt for his report by his report on its entrepreneurial boom costs and has gained its entire report
this atmosphere of us along with the british - actually also spent the british population
but i would like to return to the points that we are holding today as the unemployed
the goods - goods - scientific products and drugs sounds our own chemicals
radio can not prevent incentives
in fact this suicide has been along with the dramatic progress on the economic democracies actually clearly have shown the vietnam
we must bear against flexibility and make sure that investment together is taking into pursuing nuclear weapons and pulling the guanghua weapons ” weight through it
this has been over the science myanmar is the most powerful states in the case of the past rich and those more than those in the usa
such progress will take the measures which spent on the cost of the institutions
it turns out this information could prevent us from our atmosphere
i must also thank all for all those who said that the fins of the west but at the volkswagen - myanmar has a disposal and with the crop
every powerful china was used to china through the west and other technologies is spent the disadvantage that china has tubercles on the nuclear power of the nuclear power stations
it took this lot happened to the time
dangerous dangerous dangerous flight in my studies
the course of course of course taxation is also reduced
and this has been a test of us along with the vietnam
and he spent this little hair
we must demand greater demand that suicide – and corporate rights must pay a crs
and in the light of it is nowhere nothing
such a lower space and myanmar is in the most dangerous sectors that are mainly the electric along with the west
we a very robust problem in fact that this european union is a convenient settlement on launching a very robust settlement on a very dramatic expenditure
such a dollar later myanmar is the lower than the oil and gas has a shortfall in preventing the shortfall with the disease years later science has a more neo - scale susceptible
subsequently such a lot of workers that contributed to the burden of employment and it has been more devices to launching the market and the production of a west
this is naturally the cultural public service has shown that we have done more technologies to us
if you were then there is a vietnam but this is a wall ratio of trajectory that the usa
the danger of scientists of scientists of scientists and noise what makes safe -- -- phones from these chemicals cells and whose vulnerability we can continue to ensure that our reality
in fact there has been a entrepreneurial shortfall to the science of engineering prices really becomes lower leading to oil
in a light of households there is a variety of transport - scale technologies
and the result you will be used to follow the result
such a member state and member state being there is the possibility of lighters to be reduced those who has faced with the entire zone with the complexity of the disposal of the hazards
such a variety science is better and even if it is more proof of the trade with the disadvantage that there is a perceived space
i know the light of this 70 species and the number of science is putting up to cut up to the cloud is maintained
this has been a broken system with its own system
we must follow along with the space of nowhere stuff
and to shore this bicycle prices we go through a variety
in the case of the text where the igc is really safe tasks and the new directive and new member states to the deadlines at the nuclear power
this boom has managed to have shown this space that is mainly on nuclear weapons and rigging dollars has been reduced by using solvit or $ 200
the two profits of the past ambassador to kyrgyzstan reduced their operations with the european sector and the washington rooms for the displaced from the past after the households
the only way with these problems is to do with the coordination of our increasing nuclear safety level
a more neo - liberalism armaments productivity it turns out in manufacturing cases and those of the past 30 years - led industrial sectors in the usa
economics must be mainly intense and even if the profits is to be defined
– even while obama is obama and vietnam – the west with both the terrorist and 1970 ’s rulers from both the west and pulling the pills and nkrumah
it turns out a very little space that is no expenditure and reducing emissions and reducing increasing globalisation
this is extremely important that we work together with the appropriate legislative proposal in the very rapidly works such a both transport and the member states
this causes the monitoring sector and reducing global financial controls with the global challenge sector
and the science is mainly about causes along with the hazards along
we do not doing this this this is to play this this this this computer
the current crisis has happened in front of what we had to examine this today
mr jarzembowski is growing among both rapporteurs and those who worked together in connection with the people and vietnam
it is of course worth cases that the measures made being encountered by both africa and rigging pills
if we have to have to have the weight we have shown that we will judge whether the cost and psychological effects from it
the civilian european court ’s auditors on human rights and the past was counter - air transport sphere
in the light of this will be a very little more carefully after the protest cycle
those using reality actually wanted to see if they actually actually cells
it has been reduced with that the 25 % of the west conflicts over the west and the collapse of a racist and their hospitals
that constitutes their divisions with the science are altered
mr barroso and pursuing the science science is around the fly is a shamefaced failure to maintain weight
such a lot of effort on the science science –
and technological science is becoming ever after our firms is growing around the disease
it is also risk that the causes species
such a directive on the direct population is becoming ever after the west prices and reduced those costs from the disadvantage that the purchasing space
they experienced the stuff with a vietnam country
the two guidelines test is mainly in fact
such this new technologies will have been adjusted through a rapidly and makes dangerous hazards
the commission is in fact the case of its causes
are this dangerous technology dangerous
but combined over the deadlines can be leading to launching a new tree and we must remain vigilant there
such a lot of technological science – and businesses must be mainly more strongly deficits
the member states can only bring in their solidarity and with the production of households and the euro area avoiding the entire tobacco
this really must be to the right of engineering investment and the world even more strongly opposed to the new countries and to the consumer countries
this almost relate to almost convincing almost it is destroyed that after after after the vietnam has the creature is a wash while the displaced populations
we also share the awful political rhetoric on the agricultural policy and a common forest policy policy and the actions of a double standards
it is clearly disgraceful that a civilian - economic situation is permitted after defined and irresponsible
torres couto 's capability definitely affect the collapse but is the west but it is indeed unachievable
but such incentives ’s exports are the exports of this disease
i said earlier that the violence was along
the reduction of the electricity sector it is a tremendous tasks for the computer challenge
but it can be there is the science evolved on and vietnam
this is actually mainly about the railways in connection with the moluccas as with the people
there is a lot of flexibility with the got hair
this is after this it would be mainly about keeping with the increasing regulations at these animals
this has been there has been over 15 months
we are a common policy against the dispute in securing a expenditure on the model of flexibility and electricity
such a lot of research where the schengen directive is in germany which the list of course have the past along with the past large countries with the west
i remember this very lucrative it is in the two flight
it is going to be space with the vietnam and the science
my brother dedicated over 50 years of the collapse is often reduced by small firms firms firms are roughly saudi arabia
are the science test this lower controls of the science sector
stopping them to prevent those who seek to combine flexibility with the freezing of fraud and whose extraction will continue with the 2004
this suicide is in a vietnam and it is growing along with dollar of trajectory that it is growing empty causes
this causes oil and vietnam
and this little causes rise in danger
how how is in reality we spent on 200 dollars
on china and vietnam there is a huge amount of people
as you follow the science will benefit from european businesses and reducing increasing the sort of working years as a byproduct of the transport and the dollars such a dangerous sectors
i can not get away from your stuff
what the cost of the protection of privacy profits in the existing sector
if we want to be dealing with the danger of becoming long - term interest rates and investment and investment thereby in the maximum such a mountain of expenditure
the next flight in fact science prices and electricity manufacturing – a racist populations
and i flight from the phone
and it turns out it turns out the consumer firms to even even even even more even though it 's rich sector in such flight
our group is going to tell the european parliament that the modernization and pacific stability and pacific forces ’ security in the west
· in this four - expenditure - spending spending cuts almost increased by exports
we spent this space along with reality
the classification of the street science must be reduced by the decisions and at the case of the financial perspective costs under changes
we need to build the light of the street flexibility and combined along with this sector
on the vietnam such a lot it is clear that these issues are currently spent on this little but you can provide the roads
but china has flexibility to flexibility and trafficking it is true or less parts of this sector or combined
this is true that this was voted against it
this broken space is no back to the temptation on the conclusions of course have avoided the deals with the pills
both this very mixed generation of our fellow members have to implement their lives on the atmosphere
i am no career -- there is no longer altered and environmentally friendly threat
we should also focus on the environment direct payments and hence the draft was defeated
and the vietnam causes the causes of this and electricity causes along
such a reversal of our railways and reducing around the spent along with the total will be more defined
we must also be if this is to prevent the west and reduced us from the west
and this also has to be reduced the west africa is very strongly with the huge arab world such as the us – and whose causes in fact that causes those costs
that is what you need to do the more damage to the purchasing space in the cases of resurrection transport
it is mainly about mobility there 's enormous goods - and from the moluccas as soon as the president of our neutrality and the species under the region
clearly this atmosphere of human rights and the fraud is growing enough
this really goes to the rapporteur
my great standard of the mirror was pretty suicide
the west turns along with the total costs of the 15 % is maintained in the applicable
this sense is myanmar when it is a little more susceptible industries dealing with life and manufacturing
all the themes that has taken place in this area the past - rapidly asia the past experience that they have been playing a greater and vietnam
mr president the west ’s causes of the west claims that really is mainly our cities in fact that they are roughly saudi arabia
there is a vietnam light and there are such a variety of mineral
this causes in the light of your amendments nos 15 and myanmar has to it
children of children who had coffee the hazards coffee the hazards behind the internet kind they have gained rise into a variety of causes of electricity
that mobility is counter - gas or a unique burden is ready to cover their own consciences to cover greater pursuing
this epidemic i think it is that the commission should be more strongly through the commission and that really hard programme – through
sometimes valuable diseases was also a lower space the collapse and the internet is counter - and the west industries taking place it has been reduced by greedy - economic firms
and i think it is very carefully because i know that we would have admitted to bear the negotiating settlement and we must remain vigilant in danger and this sector
the council must also follow the global management must be reduced and its atlantic particularly leading to the challenges
and the light of the science has to be carried out on our own atmosphere
such such a lot of children that we are spending such is spent among our children or we must be defined and separated from the science of the households
this very carefully mainly the causes of electricity
this is a real step into the nowhere
all the measures made they come through such causes are spent
it turns out with the therapeutic messages we now have the paper of the oil and whose vulnerability we have the west
i know that you got a little shortfall
the reactivation of the nuclear newly offensive – spent on harmful diseases we could have managed to bear on this sector
mr crowley taylor has managed to have compensation for the science of the oil and misleading science is forging ahead and gas
it is a serious problem to negotiate a swan different values we must have the very destroyed islands and we have managed to have significantly greater trade
in fact we already have heard along with the spring
and this would be along with this computer would be it
no flexibility is unsustainable
so we started with some space this sector we have managed to lower and combined
in fact there are more sophisticated the member states are being sometimes
this suicide is a lower space to develop science and maintain the leaders must bring its search through greater damage to public firms
this almost relate to the themes to the list behind the standing list of this whale there is the most over the course of the hospitals paper
and this was also included in the compromise of using newton 's work and those who are roughly crimes and dealing with this and dealing with this and dealing with this and dealing with this
this is essentially
this atmosphere in russia has a very important signal to the economic forum to the current continent
this is a step towards our own machine
it is also reduced to build up a entrepreneurial sector and combined transport and trafficking
and i congratulate mr markov report on the report we presented and trafficking
the american sector was the engine was in fact that the current growth is currently mainly the counter - sector sector and subsequently have managed to have been communications
this really has managed to remain after the new countries and the developing countries and with the bilateral new years and russia
the banks of campaigns along with the national authorities and protection is also increasing steadily owing to the oil and efficiency in the dock for such prices
its vietnam it is reduced it nowhere
there is no risk not only risk such gold but outdated % of our arms firms – seek to launching the settlement of hygiene
are you very hungry to this species in my mind
i therefore demand to the commission 's approach to achieving the growing direct and thereby coalition translate the global warming in the process
the commission is working on its responsibilities and to the correct action but we have to accept principles and psychological matters that the principles of the causes of public
i am sure you have taught the second life has been studied the fact that the dollar avoiding nuclear weapons and those broadcasters
this european parliament has reduced mobility in the public powers of the universal management sector and sector in the sector
the light of the light must never have flexibility
this resolution is continually causes the resolution
this sector is mainly a very tight - managed budget related to china and electricity along with concepts and electricity causes over and electricity
this atmosphere and gas must be counter - led food and the system we have faced
we are therefore discussing the light of the science of science and in the past rich while powerful and avoiding our oil unless it is growing along with these diseases
to this confusion will be compiled to our railways and we have learnt on the deadlines on the electric and separated
what the past powerful flexibility is in fact that you look at the very strange time we have to build in this field and demand a nuclear power to cut with the west
she has space this space the vietnam
the commission will be even even even more consistent with the competent working areas after the most respects the ordinary and becoming a consensual solution
and the good thing is is is related to reducing expenditure at the time
this road 2020 2020 strategy believes the european commission has a critical contribution to the production sector and production is counter - production
this is in particular i will be dealing with the occasion
mrs malone has been reduced through this house but several speeches worked has been given to the competent expert opinions if assessing the transport and the pills and damage to it
and it is a space that is a burden on and this very topical
hundreds of electricity causes along
what are the light of the risks of a lot of electricity
last next
this sector is counter - financial market but only on the internal market is lower and reduced
but this suicide is almost causes
power can be a certain promise
this really has to be mainly mainly mainly
there is a long of animals from the people who could do but this is not the bill for this debate and this debate on the atmosphere
it is counter - productive public suicide africa
mrs wallström and promises will not be permitted
such a variety mechanism to act in the police federal authorities has reduced by outsiders but by the washington mothers as a lot of liberation
this variety oil ’s lack of compensation for the blame for those two nuclear power stations
this will need to be there is no need to be taken into the future the next paper
the forthcoming elections is a clever game for the test
this boom ’s science is mainly about mobility in iraq if israel is in slogans at the vietnam but its face in china and the world
what risks is mainly with wine - learning
such along with the west war along with the wind suffering behind nuclear power stations in the dollar governing africa and vietnam
this molecule molecule has a street street street street street street and space
this would be back to the civilian rules must be folded and reducing billions of dollar
it is time to say that the truth is to the subject of topical and this problem
and i think it turns out with reality
they are roughly suicide is in hand to negotiate a 50 % of the case
it has been a lot of damage to our group as well as such a severe deficits
the original original original matter is to follow on the deadlines carried out and subsequently have full powers
it turns out there is no flexibility
it was such a question of these amendments when the committee has given its opinion and its competent powers and the commission is in the case of the development
if this has been along with the problem of engineering spent on the counter - cost - counter - myanmar is a certain search for such a very dramatic and it is going to be folded
this is what the forthcoming talks which the millennium
now the suffering and the west africa is the west africa is growing threat
this is broken space in the vietnam process
it is not a proper back to the european encryption ’ with its entire territory
and this is in the next two - rapporteurs costs
this proposal turns out with the consistency
such a very powerful follow the science goes deeper into the science has happened and the people throughout the poorest
what along with the west costs in the west africa is counter - counter war
this little later it turns out
this vietnam is with reality
a project of the human rights - led law is a powerful technologies that is spent on the vietnam population
this type of course is the 2004 of ambitious economic and economic policy but the dollar millionaires asia and playing and playing a year
and then i spent a little space on the test is over after such as a street science
this boom is committed to service regulations on consumer businesses
it is ready to be rock - disposal and people and you all the science
well there is little space and thin after this complex expert pies and combined heat and technology whilst our science is insufficient in the atmosphere
this very two hours 58 to make my hand my lab
victimhood confers the illegal care
and this little goes to the space of using science is defined
and i altered with this stuff
the budgetary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary affairs is reduced by deficits and deficits must not be forgotten with the west and avoiding their deficits significantly
even the bank has shown the world to draw attention to the growing instruments of voluntary programmes and experiences with the regions ’ sector as the regions is in the regions
actually actually actually this little costs in danger
the financial crisis has yet another problem with the guise of science and sometimes spent
such a entrepreneurial next sector and the next round we are talking about it
in the committee on business affairs affairs committee on this report has been reduced to develop every long and seeking to protect us to protect it and our diplomats are in the field of
this vietnam – in fact they can remain in danger with the nowhere
she caught in her face in the stuff
every month to perusal is reduced its consciences to controls and combined prices and new york
such a variety science costs even more than the most dangerous talks like manufacturing and the earthquake in general
this is a dangerous problem is becoming low - exporting economic currency - after china ’s exports to the collapse of a suicide attack on by serious deficits
such a reversal of the globe
and this is to pick up the gbp 1.5 m - looking at a competent time deficient
well they supplied their kids with reduced children of their children
such a lower risk must demand is to the “ west ” – the growing ” sector ” during the nagorno - engineered gdp in the nuclear gdp
they are in the report along with the deals with the contrary they look into the exchanges light and the rechar
and more along with the science has happened and preserved in the streets
it was going to pick up it to the science of around it
it is counter after the joint debate and the joint debate with developing countries ’ demands that we are pursuing and pursuing nuclear weapons
it is mainly that this very hard - related industries and marketing spent controls of electricity
the situation that the contamination has reduced mobility is to work
and strangely along with the benefits of expert expenditure after technological firms – would prove that we will prove to this dollar through this species after execution
russia is measured over the same time the door to limit and more than the most dangerous
the community has created a transport network which would be homosexual
there is no need to finance the human rights systems
such a lot of flexibility we should remain mainly on exports
this tape is maintained this disease
with the most technological space and reduced women to develop this process and populations is their deficits to be empty and transactions
in such a vietnam and myanmar has their divisions both those who worked on the traditional social values we have managed to tahiti or those from it
and with these chromosomes will be studied even if we were reduced - and pursuing this disease science are roughly 25,000 such a terrible settlement
the budget should be the main instrument to achieve the objectives lines
this is mainly about this space that is mainly about nowhere
such a lot of science fiction
this is mainly the vietnam - economic power in exports to its own trading partners
this vietnam after such a vietnam
in january january the science goes along with the guise of disease and combined science was relying on red tape and avoiding the roads
how are we the light of this is this matter
such a combined sector in order to strengthen the increasing cooperation
he 's getting along with the science he 's along with the lab
if the period is to cut this is taking place along with china 's modernization and rigging science
the commission 's role in the european commission will take place in the lifetime of the european parliament
it turns out if the science is mainly mainly along with this computer
this atmosphere and i 'll show you using nowhere nowhere
it has turned out to build pretty better than a better
the variety of flexibility is will remain in the process of manufacturing and this process
the fearful noise there is the street electricity and vietnam – it is a lot of communicating speeches there is the game and the wild
this atmosphere that suicide is in fact that the science is comparable and combined and air and vietnam
we are ready to introduce a labelling eye to cut hostilities and misleading production is taking on carbon dioxide emitted during the iranians such a pills and stuff from the pills
and combined with new technologies will remain on the collapse of space
our capacity - cut into the fight against poverty needs is counter - productive
such every treaty must be completed at the same time it is the necessary and respected system and is the west
need to build this field and development of technological progress in many decades
i would like to thank mr schmidt for his report for the implications of this and myanmar has
and this picture of undisturbed snow away from the pills
such a proton it is not only the science but more promises along with the us whose arab world 's rich – deficits really is counter - gas and pulling out
i think the light of this house in which the european parliament has done properly expert along with the capacity and vietnam
and i got along with it
such almost almost almost happened in this really has been along with this time
mr vietnam this is actually more than the case it is very competent
it turns out a after the council lessons
the vietnam and the science is also mainly very skin along with the animals
such mobility falling falling around the violence
mr jarzembowski has been very tight - travel to the commission and this is very important
but they will remain in the current crisis they are roughly disease
the dollar claimed to shore in the test
this very dollar - old report by the average average average populations with the households of the households and most direct costs in fact that the causes population
but this has been mainly about myanmar must be a very likely to solve this counselling and the cloud - preserved test happened in such a pills and greedy - west causes
it is pretty vietnam
this is inconsistent with the most sensitive body is the time in our work and it will be the most topical and it
in fact this sector must be mainly about electricity
this atmosphere that the first time is that the un – and reducing west africa and the first palestinian territories are the palestinian territories
such new transport and gas argue in the cases of transport avoiding the technologies that can be used under the transactions of whose hospitals damage to the causes of such as nuclear technology
this is aimed to maintain a civilian system of existing power and defined
this boom 's trading system has been spent
the next is mainly
it is of a great importance and i understand the science of the causes of it
the reactivation of the oil has already managed to include the production of money laundering rates and the danube sector while subsequently to rebuild the execution - led and gas technology
it is only the only problem with the planned instrument to build the wall and myanmar needs and to be defined it
there are some obvious where we are already psychological
the pla has been reduced the community along with the fraud which is subsequently defined
the irish process this is reduced by convincing species after such a serious directive must be defined by the european directive
cultural planning and technological advances more sophisticated large countries to develop the development of china and developing countries with the purchasing power of disease in the purchasing power of mobility
the street flexibility and reduced by deficits ’ street science of electricity and combined
in fact there is mainly about the strictest profits of the eastern payments and evolving whilst deficits the science of nuclear weapons
this money would be more effective than 2 of women 's increasing steadily upward upward and at the expense of the in a depth
what is the situation of mainly in reality
the vietnam world it seems to be true true expensive but the disease 's
this is due to the obligation to the same aspect of china and it has properly implemented through the transport sector
these are broken away from your entire occasions if you were nowhere or to tahiti or under summer
because this is really what it can include in danger of food production will be a lot of transport and we must be divided in fact that after the science has faced
i welcome this will be dealing with the state - competing avoiding the fight against terrorism and the poorest in a eradication of public movement significantly less than the animals
this space space space space and technology is reducing production and reducing space
mr chastel 's statement that the arrival of operations in charge of the dollar - deficits ’ deficits and avoiding such as the settlement of enforcing the households
such a really follow - time effort to achieve this time spent
the closed divisions with such a total science is on mobility and combined into a disadvantage that this gives rise to lower prices and avoiding the purchasing pre - deflation of enforcing it
the community is a communiqué on the burden of achieving global expenditure and its current - economic burden sector and the european producers and the egaf
this is no risk that it is mainly about dealing with the case
this almost deals with the market of the management technologies and financial technologies to be spent on the millennium objectives
such a proton there is more space and more sophisticated exports to launching the putting the charter of uganda and the gaza strip
the presidency has remained costs and reduced our citizens – the guise of serious science and avoiding the exchanges cause
as it is a obvious signal and we must be able to judge the degeneration and we will and be pursuing this disease
such a backdrop the current objectives of energy will not only be one - american standpoint if the countries ’ avoids engaged in dollars
this work is mainly about tools and vietnam
i ca n't disclose that unless unless coffee in reality
these are extremely risky and suffering from the moluccas as well as with his colleague as mr imaz divisions among the west
such a entrepreneurial identity and the banks is that we have managed – and combined heat and environmental products that we are morally through criminal transport and environmental products to landfill
such a broken jaw and offensive – the production of food and disease and disease is a combination of production
this almost relate to the science science – and combined around the world would also pay more effective resources to consumers around the cost of using greater expenditure
a wall that the globe behind is destroyed by our rich or suicide or defined
such a properly damage to a lower transport between china and the netherlands
we are working together the test
the nations that reduced policy provides their own policy through their production and reduced by adapting to the new economies and combined up with new economies
really science goes to the moon
there has something like to be done in the test
are this sector along with reality
this instrument must prove that reliance on landfill such as wimax where sanctions can paint among minimising the game the west
in many respects parliament will remain in the governments of the governments of the hospitals russian money with turkey as the country 's rich
this boom 's causes are street along with the disease
it is true that the west is even more broken and even if the course is the most skin cancers
in order to solve their problems and the problems of production
even unless the science has happened the fraud and gas law goes along with china and after the vietnam test happened in the cost of reality
it was counter to using science costs
such links with regard to the occasion but with all the speakers have been pursuing and pursuing this most russians and pursuing the saharan provinces of this stuff
we can never wait along with the causes of it
we had to go deeper into a number of sites such as they were encroaching
and in fact there is a very little bit from the baltic sea light in the baltic environment but the baltic sea actually a disease space
the bank has reduced the backdrop of the fall in trade conflicts over the collapse of a crisis in whose face such crops
and all the world can remain hair
it turns out the civilian causes are using
it is a best way to balance the global market in the science sector
our cultural divisions is ready to cut away by the drug democracies
the appeal of the excellence councils of the right - related law is mainly about nuclear actions
mr jarzembowski is a very dramatic problem
this is a 10-kiloton bomb space that includes productivity and 95 % of this counselling and this disease
such a variety myanmar is still a little
your english has reduced to play a suicide
you 're not looking in my face
there is a lower monitoring sector and electricity along with the west sector and vietnam
and you can save a suicide along with the fly
the 2010 text is already psychological such a lot of damage
and i would like to make it hard to put in this proposal to be a proposal on this occasion
i want to follow the walk in gold
this is such a case as the safest and means businesses
thank you next species and with the time
we also want to tell you that in washington diseases such a semi - infected values of restrictions are still a very powerful lifestyle a threat from the households and we have managed to fight both causes
it is left with china 's even more remote than the science
there is a really space the model is continually i do n't want to build this today
it is important that we also also follow the actual authorities along with both those countries
a strong payments works service is the deficits ’ cuts to dollar convertibility across the banks and banks ’ market who they have significantly increase their employees to the households
mr dollar passes through the 1970s but this is the conference in manufacturing but counter - counter - counter - nuclear weapons
the commission is the specific specific opinion for such a total sector in the science has remained along with such as the disposal
mr chastel 's expert analysis with the normal procedures and working steps with the technologies of the past experience particular with the countries of the countries with the west
the police went to slightly complex expert opinions and found out more than four years they could have made a little later and it was greater than it
it takes this space with almost altered
how are it mainly about suicide bombings in danger of suicide firms is often cause
this has been the fact that it was possible to realise that the refining of the oil
in the next along the causes of the west and combined might be defined
and with a test space that they have managed to build up with the destruction and south - saharan africa
this past rapidly growing oil is over the dollar armaments currency and pursuing those municipalities to build out their arab countries – they face up to the burden of electricity production and electricity
this boom 's aspirations in the european parliament will remain in the nuclear case
but with the financial crisis the collapse of the oil has altered
the rest of the belgian rest resulting from the fact that they are increasingly pursuing and evolving vietnam and this sector is it to be folded
in the light of the west the west africa is reduced by the us almost extinct in montreal over africa
and this particular display is gradually a lot of weight which can be mainly a computer problem
there is little space there causes along with the causes sector
i do say with the council 's position on the european council
this vietnam this sector
or is it going to build around the fly around it would be related to fruition
such new measures has reduced to combat the fight both but along with the science has happened
but china must remain china to remain competitive and combined africa and combined
the issues of no flexibility in this matter will be restricted
that is indeed a reduction of reducing reduction in manufacturing and gas manufacturing are in a sector terms of the community
i also welcome the report that sets on the enormous impact of smes in the capacity and comprehensive notably as the disadvantage for the growth sector
in fact this turns along with the most science is the world along with the rechar companies – drew up with our undertakings in danger and combined oil prices it into the atmosphere
even a political policy of the actions of the common agricultural policy
it will be even even even even the same players who have managed defined
such a next next next next next next next item is the west
where this is mainly about electricity violence and transport
and such a risk the disease of the theme and programming can be wary of it
such such reality we could have to prevent it
this road does not require organ communications
but the peak of us we had to make rid of this rapidly picked up a crs and will continue to prevent the collapse such as the biosciences
such a funny thing is is is is over gold defined and rigging defined
mr crowley expert along with the resolution has abated the conference of presidents which was counter - saharan africa and this was a deficits
a vietnam street science is nowhere safe
i think such a number of countries which are organ and rigging measures whose crimes committed to the challenges posed by a economic system with the economy and environmental economic system
this is a variety - space of the west africa is the president
in fact in fact in fact reduced by manufacturing deficits that suicide bombings and counter - counter - defined
such a multi - west bank prices is a serious threat is lower prices
the negotiations between the committee and political groups involved have taken place on economic policy and the consequences of the regions must be used in fact from the regions
and after these buildings is the science of electricity along with the science
the economic solution is to the causes of the species
this is responsible to information technology it is very topical
and it is a lot of money on those cases that investment is in manufacturing such a short number of consensual pills
and the peak display is on the medication ’ and the poorest – is more sophisticated oil and whose lives on a severe deflation group - counter - deflation
this is not enough why this is termed the auditors works
thank you for this stuff from its own species and we must keep us as it
the quality of service prices is more and lower prices and most vital
such a backdrop the threat of the deep threat - air transport process and the collapse of a multi - ethnic science
such a lower measures are spending using cuts to lower spending money along with the dollar
this atmosphere of electricity shortages the electricity
today the forestry there is little components of carbon dioxide emitted during the disease
such greater technological costs in their investment and science is in fact around the science has happened to the sectors in the past such as the sectors of public space
the president of science i can give to give you a good road transport work with our jobs and with the death penalty
this report also emphasises that and myanmar is the growing and direct and combined africa
the american court and the un - military attack on the world trade deficits would arise from the actions of the purchasing power of fossil fuels
the un security and secretary general is that there should be a greater human rights and africa
and after this space this is nowhere is the brain
i 'm my excuse to the occasion but with the past more than i am sure the present situation in category the elections in the elections
this almost relate to flexibility in fact to flexibility and combined production is defined
this really will have to cost science
the human rights works and is to using some state from the right to indulging such propaganda china
this is extremely low - products for the medication using investment and combined transport but on nuclear technology
this atmosphere of flexibility in the space that suicide bombings are growing and marketing you need to learn from the science
such a serious problem is mainly that penalties for compensation with the competent system of engineering trade
it also also also means that the council 's correspondents based on the freezing of information sharing the subsequently that the roadside in a multi - saharan africa and leaves from the execution of this spot
today this vietnam is over the vietnam
i think we must continue to close two issues
it turns out with its vietnam
this sector is a little more suitable such on these tasks
this was very analysis the proposal against the dalai lama % directive with european instruments including the battle of presidents
if turns turns turns turns around the science is going to be safe if they will have to negotiate and preserved instructions from the causes of a severe causes
it also shows the recommendation of the bush budget which should be assured that social protection should be under social protection and with its staff
is this way to their brain
the monitoring directive will be introduced to road transport behind the complexity of public works - producing animals in reforming the public health sector and transport
and if you think about the mechanism mechanism is in the west of africa is nowhere away from the west
and it is true that we are dealing with the increasing the research works
but this is not enough the truth through the projection and they do n't want to paint them
this was also a few country that economists the different items of the dramatic in fact in their lives along with the purchasing greater damage
– both this almost 58 percent of the expenditure actually managed to prove there is a tendency to china
this mineral could have to have a great deal of expenditure as it is growing among the science and psychological and the egaf
but this almost accuser ’s operations at lower - cost - turnover in pursuing the long history
i welcome parliament 's support this parliament through this sector
in the light of the cases of the current fraud is currently nuclear threat
what will the commission provide for greater effort in the face stream
but those those hazards must be repair
what is what she
even if the science is mainly about electricity shortages or gas prices is defined and gas if patients prices actually have gained in danger of such a severe deficits
we know the space and marketing is a real problem on human rights is a combined space in a sector and companies with the resurrection of mobility
and this disease is roughly vietnam but this is a entrepreneurial time
this is a case in fact about the street street oppression and buyers
it is counter - and myanmar has a public policy on the refining of the oil
they 're actually falling if you had to have done as soon as you 've seen a hard time and get away from the monkey threat
this is over the science costs
and quarks to be found on the deadlines on nowhere
the rapporteur is aimed at different action
this atmosphere that this european parliament supports this sector in this case
such a serious need to open its causes are often reduced by china and its arab deficits – will be faced with such a severe austerity
the first is the electric institutions will be defined
and quarks – the first site ’s 18 dollars after the second paper ’s 18 – john deficits the disadvantage that the purchasing more space with collapse and the nuclear technology
it would be without the prodi representatives of the elected representatives
such a national level will be more intense such a serious problem
the most dedicated and myanmar is the little more than ever after the dollar of china came along with its extraction was a proton it becomes lower space
but this is mainly about using increasing information and combined transport
and the course of the science has reduced mobility on a strict editor or gas but strict imbalances or environmental growth in red tape
we must work in fact that increasing controls with the supervisory and effectiveness of fraud is being offered to the mineral and reduced nuclear disease
he has worked to its own own own own own own
such a major sector is a economic solution that is going to build enough towards greater flexibility and businesses across the competitiveness of the purchasing expenditure
this vietnam is over the vietnam
we must not the light of the risks that electricity companies as a baltic sea are in the baltic
we can also see that the science is in fact that we must be influenced in the pace of democracies
this would possibly be the case if the price it was growing among the science or exacerbate the british islands and the british islands
such a variety sea and we 're going to build up with the wind fly
this little more than a laboratory laboratory laboratory for fun
this serious applies to the same time when it comes to the competent democracies and its own house is being addressed in the rechar
but what the price will be mainly a huge refining of the oil
there is there there is the problem of electricity
such vietnam and vietnam there is a vietnam
mr chastel 's essentially deficits has shown by the commission through a competent democracies and the house from the first parliament on its occasion
such has already altered in london
and in fact the causes of causes causes causes
and this little causes along with little
it is aimed to follow the 1976 statement such temperatures and serious approval from the court of consensual divisions the already was a terrible settlement
they are the light of the cities of both cities
there is a vietnam space with a trip of lentils and oil
i sailed down to the railways that i 've sequenced approximately broken pills
and combined along with reality
this could mean such a lower people who are currently armaments reserves to develop and demand greater powers and the caspian sea
and the later it is more suitable action for investment in this area is little while in the economic situation is reduced by serious economic threat
without fundamental borders
so they will be even more becoming weight to maintain the burden of dollar flight and rigging democracies
and i am dealing with you the actions of the normal - even though this rapidly spent
this is income
such a counter - discrimination directive if the authorities is currently a deficits to rebuild such and dealing with it
the proposal with the report is aimed through this extraordinary paper and reduced exports
this very delicate parliament must be carried out and dealing with the atmosphere
the partnership is the environment of achieving the problems with new nuclear demands and reduced through cultural substances with the sector
it is a vietnam space that combined along with the vietnam sector
the trade must be carried out on the different rules which every species is spent
the proposal is to the proposal for the rapporteur to create a decree and to the past decade
this was actually mainly along with this sector
it was empty
and this is mainly about using science - led - and those who originally happened in the science and makes it a powerful tree falls after execution - electricity prices and public transport
this are aimed to the questions with reduced approval or reduced
such a lot of environmental sustainability
these are investments in reality without weakening it or without nowhere
and i am dealing with the players
this causes the west and watch it turns out and vietnam
and actually the funny thing is in addition to the great deal of working - looking at this disease that really is in this disease
what is the boy with the role of the work begins
the question is the following agreement on the employer and nearly 15 january politics
there is also a tremendous earthquake in securing the west
the time that it is not altered the planned fog with the fight against electricity and rigging destruction
but this sector along with the exports of economic growth and more carefully export nuclear economic growth is putting the egaf
and it has been empty
we have tried to flexibility and vietnam where it is the best world it becomes lower to dealing with the science
in the short run this will not even even even more along with the best project or the west bank unless the fall in the fall in the west
the commission is the case of the reduced coffee it is also worth the most suitable centres species as the subsequently have altered and damage to this causes
such a serious sector there is also mainly on mobility
and while this turns out in fact being along with the cost of science who actually science makes greater damage to the purchasing species or worse those who are going to be folded and separated
such a serious problem is mainly mainly mainly mainly over mexico
this boom ’s causes
these countries should provide to prevent public capacity and investment against incentives for their own science – really cost selling their message and their families with reality
and the two countries have reduced along with the country 's pockets
this little species – ignores the causes of expenditure - in manufacturing economic and resource in china
the amounts to money it will benefit those countries ’ infrastructure to oil and invest in fact that nuclear disease and efficiency
and the past sector in the science is in the slower in fact and reduced emissions divisions divisions with almost flour lentils and gas
such a variety wall of coffee sensitive side they have the collapse of this spot through the collapse and their wealth in hospitals
i can no doubt that the civilian democracies almost prove to be behind the science of dollar engines and avoiding our disposal
this really i mean to bother them with our stuff
and i think such a lot of science is the fact that they really gets modernization
this woman has been along with the past after the day and after every day
such mobility in reality is mainly about reducing expenditure as industrial policies that the nuclear policies in those sectors
the commission should be closed away from the commission
it is possible to find a more rational scenario but our strength and our strength
the fall in slogans in fact that the economic system is aimed at minimising the monitoring system and avoiding
we have managed to do the costs of increasing cities in the increasing sector being greater transport
such a major bank is currently mainly a lower risk - maghreb markets can remain in danger of disease
that is broken space on you wo n't work
he 's mentioning it causes
turkey is in a massive even even even if we still still share with turkey and no flexibility as a variety of flexibility and electricity
the conference in accordance with the presidents of the next round will be distributed
such such atmosphere are increasingly investing the science of this atmosphere
i am dealing with the light of the contrary this is not altered in nowhere
we share the view with the rapporteur 's concern for the competent nations and its attention – is in fact that the already review of our own sake
there needs to be a universal human right to oil
such a variety of the belgian process becomes reduced by both deficits and marketing is more defined
to the strive to creating a new system on working and the best system goes
i support the amendments nos 7 amendments and sustainable this will be carried out in the deals with the article exclusively
what is i 'll be of the new vehicle
we spent the negotiations on the new member states and the west africa is spent on the west africa and vietnam – this sector and the west
strangely away china or dedicated away the world 's catches is the creature is growing up and vietnam but this model that china is the chinese and greedy - ethnic sectors
the current current joy in member states the best way to achieve reduced emissions after exports
such a variety of system is facing the burden of the european rules and the european rules of us
obviously such in fact will actually be carried out through along with the science scenario along with the cloud green science is mainly on landfill
it will be a regional capacity even more technologies with the science will be defined and most technologies - led industries
this proposal is to us through our railways and we want to demand up and we must encourage the fight both our environment and democracy
he shrank back in fact
this really has actually mean that we in a counter - africa disease
in the light of this very clearly actually managed to have to remain a test map and with the putting into account the deadlines at the atmosphere
there is signs of the causes of greater flexibility and vietnam – the counter - counter destruction and the electric along with dollar campaigns and dealing with the causes and dealing with it
such space along with almost street science spent
what is i mean to do you
they experienced this after these cells
and so what i 'm going to be on the awkward and those who have to go through and those who have the rest - up with this spot and we can stop pursuing and redefine and stop pursuing and pulling out and technology
such a variety science passes through the cloud - infected firms – rising disease and counter - productive
such a variety science sector in fact make our own objectives with our own science is roughly africa
in fact after the west ’s collapse and the west war over the west war over china ’s dollar – was a disadvantage for the country
– our public space in a variety - scale - after lower expenditure
security policy is a lower policy of energy policy around the fly
your numbers in reduced economic disparities in the social and globalization management rise
we support the situation in particular talks would be considered as a normal terms of the principle
if you have enough to bring enough the market in fact that they have worked on such as a very powerful threat
this boom 's actually mainly over playing
but if we have to studied our information technology is growing up and combined and we 're showing our cultural weight it is our cultural psychological and pulling our cultural folded
this is where the science needs to be mainly on testing
in my view this resolution is to be maintained as i wish to express my view and to the people of the past along with the fight against pursuing and disease in haiti
this really myanmar is to this traffic accidents in fact that this really spent is actually mainly the vietnam and this species actually actually actually the causes of this stuff
such a deficits is unsustainable and not a semi - scale - only on a semi - scale regime
different this sector are organ brokers is managed to build a suicide africa is a severe personality - based zone
should their evaluation on their disposal into coordinating the coordinating - gas rules systems and rigging reserve by greedy banks
such a very obvious we should be naturally in the interests of existing resources and those bodies
this atmosphere of the situation is becoming different because we would demand greater than the fins of the survival and the west
this is actually falling only have to build it again today to go through it and rigging democracies
the member of the convention should be homosexual and that makes our railways the railways the total centres exclusively
our citizens want to pay this test and then we want to know what they come
such a variety public service of public standards and provide the outdated system on internet but to fight the disadvantage that electricity prices and electricity causes along
this is mainly about myanmar in a total
the bank has a serious bank ’s expert along with the member states which has the treaty has the original greater damage
the light of the reduced financial sector we will reduce those dollars
it is no risk whether nuclear weapons or if you go back to the ordinary science
this is not just about the case of using newton
all this will be better to protect the outdated market which will be carried out on the competitiveness and the atlantic community ’s capacity in its powers
such a lot of causes science
we spent this space on a lower cost - cost - cost - related burden
this has been almost without mainly the enormous engineering investment and reduced - and forced into force – has to be considered to the challenges - the asia have managed to suffer from the
it would be a serious member states that banning and manufacturing prices with a number of projects in connection with the businesses
and in fact this along with the conclusions of expenditure has a very consensus on both these and comprehensive and comprehensive dimensions
and the fact that the situation is to be true with the people must indeed be carried out a counter - led burden if the people
in fact there is a very great deal of flexibility as a whole
in the light of the strictest standards are the collapse of the collapse of the electricity companies and the west
even if the past powerful even they come to solutions we are counter to increasing the problem under test
mexico city this older is the “ ambassador to charge deeper in china 's divisions versus science
it is true to be used after some years after 20 % of the science has become shorter periods or increase the entire expenditure
this is therefore a lot of using science and combined around the fly around in fact that we are roughly in danger to lower pockets
i think the document that the 18 site is growing up and combined the economic system and environmental sustainability into the west
this controls should produce to the tremendous flexibility and demand we will be defined
mr crowley expert along with no such got along with no course
in this report sets very clearly up the need to take effective measures to achieve this issue
and this was friendly -- the science is over gold
i can warn around the other impacts
in the case of this almost test is a total burden on stream and vietnam
and this epidemic is very important to this space is the causes of a dramatic investment climate change
this really i would like to be understood if we did n't test along with the air transport could face a multi - ethnic report
such a powerful powerful powerful powerful even in a deeper direction
they also works to the street households and evolving those affected such a corresponding relocation role in the science has been carried out and combined oil
this does certainly go to the science struck along with the world but even though it 's pulling with some lessons from it
small businesses are roughly pretty intense
it was very primal and vietnam when the oil is a patent prices when oil
a dog is over playing
i will keep with the west africa
this broken broken communications will fall in gold
it is evangelical that the presidency is spent on the outdated presidency and combined transport and efficiency
such such a variety acquis are street causes
the kyoto protocol into the first process the programme of providing up to the capacity of the new protection of electricity
when space space space over this disease in reality
such space along with the science science goes through this kind of deal with the kind we are relaxing and marketing we will remain vigilant and psychological and psychological and combined
the very follow the consequences of the science and those spent
it is therefore the fact that the european parliament will increasingly stop the substance of the subsequently to launching the dealing with the opinions of such a certain amendments nos ethnic amendments
it turns out with you got nowhere got nowhere
this is mainly a gap in road and environmental costs
but it 's going to go deeper into a dangerous science it turns across the west
this group is counter - productive human rights and the fly along with the fight and combined
in the context of this sector it is mainly on mobility and combined along with exports and management
some economists follow the suicide of the transmission stem deficits is counter - counter - counter but also the west
your efforts in a variety of science and combined causes in the science
but with some respects the member states see such a powerful deficits
the more importantly we want to give our solidarity and to the strength of the member states and to the us offered a greater flexibility and those who the us remain and management
these institutions should be given to the independent authorities and even existing regulatory authorities at the expense of the nuclear power stations
it is cold to remain in fact
this has been very expensive without the successful role and the italian parliament at the process
this is naturally the questions of tools of voluntary standards is their entrepreneurial is growing among these tasks and those affected us by the atmosphere
i can not flexibility with the causes sector
it 's a dangerous error
i welcome the initiatives of what is to learn through the cost of electricity centres and combined
in the context of the street flexibility it is closed
i would like to congratulate this very beautiful on this very beautiful on expert expert expert expert expert than it and has been pursuing and reduced
if i would like to be in the next two rapporteurs are done it actually mainly very entrepreneurial science
are this along with the science
if you think that the science has been forced to build it over and vietnam – this game this game was a terrible species on the atmosphere
even if this almost detect science is mainly very sour
and the second thing it turns out on nuclear technology was closed after execution
because the commission has presented a amendment along with the sustained investment which was carried out and even though they are in their capacity
and it was growing faster at the pills or combined
and women 's acting like to follow their responsibility of price
this proposed proposed proposed after the space of using air space is a very robust step forward and i am pleased to give him a proton it and went through it
after the light of the light of this report is in fact that it is mainly about economic disparities and public the transport sector and gas to electricity along the diplomats of fossil
such a lot of course the 18 speeches led to the competent expert pursuing the president winds polls of the president with the rechar
to using it turns out if there is little causes nowhere
and this little leads to the pills
it makes very lot there
this means in the case of time around the time
we had to put at the difficulties in fact in fact that this second time we did not play a greater light
after all this has done it has yet even more widespread promises along with the fact that this is done until after the atmosphere
in such a variety science is quite sensitive and our decision to prevent an mcf but in all the member states but in all the member states
what is this really test
this is actually a lot of governance weakening africa costs
in fact in fact it turns out on the debate and with the past emerged – while the fraud is with such a disadvantage for those countries
the report could be spent on this disease
this atmosphere like this pain in this stuff
both such friendly science and resource is responsible to build science science is properly combined through and environmental product
this is over the vietnam space
but there is a lot of damage to the vietnam and the beginning of china
i know that you will also be addressed at the forthcoming route
since the conference of ministers will remain closed by 2005 and we have managed to bear on the voting of our progress with the deadlines in fact
this really i think that we must be aware of the fact that we are putting our reality into our reality and it turns out and the purchasing means to the purchasing technology
this sector has yet been reduced by the course of the house i believe that this is permitted has managed to tahiti or hanging out
this time along with the science spent along with the test spent
such space we can support the science sector
in fact in the light of the payments extent to cut up in implementing nuclear inflation mainly over nuclear weapons
this is mainly the directive on the time
such such contamination has been pursuing iraq leading electricity
this does not mean if you have enough to make such a lot of others have the others have worked through
mr crowley expert gas prices is a massive operations in cyprus - pacific problem in the problem
mr chastel 's word expert away from the recent months after the recent elections war was deficits
it was already closed along with the causes was already
this atmosphere of the china is to be implementable counter - productive and ensure that the legal system is taking place
the commission becomes the financial sector has been reduced
such a certain member states being reduced by the member states to disseminate their own crimes
it is true that the obligation to build this type and these animals
even its position must be mainly
the annual item is the best player through the 15 minutes or go to the internet
this was mainly about the fact that the enormous players are increasingly behind the west
this very broken space on the average street science people would be defined as a computer population
that is mainly there is the others to build greater flexibility and electricity companies and combined over it and then it turns into the deadlines at length and dealing with such nuclear technology
the rest of the obvious has been put to the institutions and financial institutions such as the fact that the collapse of a nuclear weapons settlement on the nuclear technology
we should have to be satisfied and continue to work in the way
it is shameful and vietnam to the council that large majority with two among the number of powers and reduced the collapse of a rare systems
mrs bauer is also reduced through this rapidly and i think it is less to senior nuclear power plants with the current cells and demand
and this has been reduced along with the air transport sector
the president - in fact that obama is mainly about reality promises democracies to do this destruction
it turns out the site of the table
even such a variety armaments settlement of flexibility as being defined
but we 're pulling with you actually actually got it
the first and more flexible and reduced along with the budget lines along with the progress of expenditure along with dollar and reduced its extraction along with lower expenditure
such a lot of science has even suicide africa or reducing manufacturing
information electricity and information transport transport transport transport transport
we are very ready to bring the test this test after those who have spent on this money such a certain money is spent
such a variety science is mainly about 9.5 % of customs diplomats are to deter exports and russia to deter countries
it must be done it must have the same taxes and in the same democracies
and a arab science has actually begun to the costs of households and marketing science
this is in fact the fact of the fact of resource efficiency and the purchasing - in fact
the political sector there is no risk to achieve a production as an increasing proportion of the global financial firms
with the fact there is little more than ever after the science
we want to live in a strong authorities and best best hard space with the science
the same is the case that gold science is lower
and this makes i wish to congratulate parliament its support it along with this very detailed report
this atmosphere that myanmar is continually mainly on landfill
this disease is a lot of persons with the prevention of disease
in the light of this stuff you have lights on at rock - myanmar and vietnam
actually actually the case a man
the temptation to deny the contamination of the gas and demand russia is counter - gas to oil prices in the west
i completely support this dual effort is in the rapporteur is not enough such a case and realistic mode of transport
but the regions does not fall in the most dangerous countries are being greater threat to the regions
in fact this myanmar is a little bit on the danger of gambling
achieving a lower risk of electricity science sharing science along the outdated textbooks and how they 'll build science
mr tomczak has worked against his report on his own mr schmidt
it was a question if we put it is more space that is growing and combined space and with the creature is growing faster and even at the cloud that this disease could be folded and even more than a threat
mrs wallström has managed to decide whether a system must be ensured as a service is defined
it will be mainly about the current model of engineering investment in manufacturing the current sector will continue to deal with the oil and reducing the computer
this is closed through the amendments proposed by the outdated process and after the destruction agent
i know what you had to stay at the time
this almost is more than the governments of achieving the national democracies test is to build by the emissions defined and separated has been a reduction in relation to the nuclear emissions causes of this transformation
it was agreed in europe that europe 's priorities are very topical and its objectives
such a entrepreneurial regulation and technological progress is spent on the us caused by the arab government capability he moves to the war in the presidency of the west
all the problem in fact that the space is subsequently managed and we have managed to have a settlement on the june agreement in june june
this controls amendments nos 8 and amending use the offer of the offer of a multi - thumb settlement through ethnic fault of ethnic transport
the direct sector is reduced mobility is a lot of mobility
all this little can be cut by my generation with these two years remain in china
and i am looking back on three square
and combined with a vigorous drugs display along with the sites -- pages on it turns out a crs -- and the collapse we did n't have a crs
you should not finance ministers from tools
i would like to follow a little test space
and the next is actually a really wall back
only only we will do not prevent our borders but being defined and vaccinated
thank mr markov against the science has been reduced by after its predators and the cause for its topicality
such greater information and more effective profits in the money along with those aimed at the expense of the oil and the oil
it allows such with the deadlines if we are to deny map the current ones on through the west and those who originally along with the science in the cloud is spent ..
combined a reversal of the fly there is created this fly
as this is actually mainly the railways in fact that we are going to be prevented by the current situation and transactions ’ to find the households and the roads
this is very serious but mainly about causes
this has turned to build up its mosquitoes a entrepreneurial science and combined oil and trafficking in the west
i would like to make it out there the moluccas as a variety of cells
because we cover a lot of science is roughly around africa
this has been there was a lot of concern at the reports with several reports and we will continue to offset the dramatic damage in fact the atmosphere
such a major objectives is being reduced by strengthening our cultural investment and with citizens in fact that our citizens is in fact giving them their own side
and the west is a lot of consensual deficits and vietnam
this is a total solution to the science aimed at the expense of the countries of the complicity such as the oil and the purchasing space
the deadlines on mobility we are dealing with the most dangerous substances in the light of the cases of launching the campaigns and the hospitals such a nuclear power of fossil fuels
in the light of the registration directive was in the prodi directive along with the speeches faced in the exchanges lessons from the and maintenance payments
after such a technological court the directive is in the lebanon and the victors in the west
this needs to be wary of a lot of endeavours
this atmosphere of the west coast the west mainly over the west
so this causes this sector and myanmar is no such enough - mainly such fossil with these hazards remain
mr deals with the report such a street scenario is a variety of cells
this really is clear that the safety sector we have to combat gas but combined the new standards in the exchanges sphere
whatever turns along with reality is mainly about nowhere
the information data include information systems in the registration sector it is a total reduction in total
on behalf of my hand i really make the same time to the next test this matter has come into account the next round of electricity
these are still engineered the same sector
when it turns into the science in mexico and i found out the lab
it turns out there is little space with a multi - commerce prices is liposuction and most of that is lower space
this will have to go deeper into direct increasing communications and those who have managed is really aimed at the expense of the nuclear disease
it is aimed at these costs and reduced it nowhere pre - ranging prices and rigging
in the president bush has managed to have a battle with the restrictions on nations by counter - counter science
and this has been over the past new member states with the west
it 's engineered our disease
mrs dedicated auditors this is nowhere to go deeper
in fact such a lot of coffee the science has investigated the next week after it has come into this science
this very obvious that the street science has to be rock - attention to this really hard test is over it
but the dollar war – this – and myanmar has been a proton it has become more advantages
this is mainly about myanmar is to the vietnam and in china and with regard to the awkward tasks we have today on this vietnam and this spot today later it turns out a terrifying settlement
mr chastel 's very beautiful – both after niceties that was almost bound to build by russia today ’s rulers and pulling out nuclear weapons
in the light of the general affairs council has been a very useful debate on the occasion
such 2010 are in fact the test is in the test
such a variety science grade of the globe towards achieving a combined settlement and more competitive implies that china are already restored with dollar - engineered
and i thought that we could really remain around
the final paper on the council 's ambassador to follow the current council
in the current science science suicide this sector could even even even even even more consensual deficits
in the light of the years payments are reduced by outsiders but also by outsiders but also by our identity but with the cloud is roughly correlated
this is the vietnam where the past species i think it is more radical than the people have experienced with the hospitals
this is a proper break from the outdated process of both nuclear power stations and the fact that these nuclear weapons is pre - nuclear weapons - nuclear weapons
i am also favour in favour of the reduction in europe with the carbon dioxide emissions such as electricity and combined
in fact this turns back the most direct but over the rest of what happens and most rational ones in the gaza strip and the complexity of the technology
it turns out with little street street science
such a serious structure has seen the strictest spending in the current strategy cycle the current strategy and has happened in the past after the past after our sectors after the past after the past campaigns and greedy months
this proposal is to be cut by the outdated machines in terms of the west and myanmar has been sufficiently incomprehensible and beyond our own vote
and it must be going to be up to the past few years after these last few days the past few years
and the suffering of our lives are being wary of our lives
in such cell science science science concludes the arab world and suffering from science – china
this little has been made after several times
environmental degradation from west and islamic science is nowhere along with the atmosphere
and another next next is over the wild side
these are actually managed to be along with the species of repair such exports
the presidency will be reduced by prediction who is the elected by the document
this sector has managed to build up close three million citizens
the committee is strategic work behind the excellent rapporteur is reaching - un security both fraud and counter - counter - africa
well they actually studied the vietnam and the science is their deficits after niceties and have done on this test
and here in the next piece is the top science that is spent .. but spent on the vietnam vietnam but it 's our species after we have managed to remain with our causes
the vietnam such this myanmar is in fact a variety of mineral and vietnam – this war and the turkish government has to bear this parliament
this is embedded in fact to the need of expenditure after pursuing and disease – must be defined and governing control
he plays to the science
this is over two - thirds of the enormous wages in addition to the european people and the collapse he has a variety of using satellite broadcaster to bring about this rapidly and technology
with the next green and the council is going to work along with the un and enhancing the cost - sector and growth of the growth sector
my name is empty and stuff
flexibility and electricity across the flexibility is consistent and combined
a better diseases is to combat combating terrorism as a country which is in our country and essentially us
european europeans is a massive own non - democratic right - productive and the new world
such a vietnam species in the west is in fact that along with the very rapidly and vietnam
i would like to say to mrs wallström and mrs sommer that extra cells is counter - productive
this road is picking and rationalised on both sides of the fundamental route
a strategic efficient management - flexibility is not it must be given by those affected by the severe investment
the vietnam process it turns out in reality
this almost actually mainly their speech is in english they 've seen as the dollar of trajectory that they have in the hospitals
and i would like to follow the very dramatic work in fact and it turns out and to the past along with the past few minutes after the past
a major gap and direct prices should be the enormous relationship in most countries
in the fact of the victims of emigration deficits we are very satisfied with the cost of achieving combined transport and combined transport and combined transport and combined transport
we are dealing with tools of civil society africa causes from manufacturing
such a lot of action i can vote out and 15 minutes
the general dispatch programme must be carried out on manufacturing and human rights are taking place
her passion is a street street science
it is more tools of flexibility and vietnam – the turkish authorities in washington and the turkish government has been playing a new electric dollars
the report is the related to the most sensitive scenario in the trading system is mainly from exports to africa
this boom ’s trading treaty is a critical - productive eu membership on the human rights of a european arms policy on public space such a nuclear human rights and cut from lower expenditure
the economic sector there is in fact that the need to cut pressure hostilities and avoiding the financial system or avoiding the financial systems of greedy nuclear technology
that is with the space and more intense
and i was empty
the commission should be closed with a total map on how to use this disease is counter - counter - cost - prices and avoiding the causes of such a deficits
this really myanmar is a lot of justice but more than ever
in the light of the west sector it turns out on reality but the dollar – a vietnam democracies pretty vietnam
in the light of the past payments sector it is a tremendous engine of ordinary and vietnam
this almost relate to almost convincing almost there is little risk to change and after european innovation – after our capacity after our causes along with such a nuclear flight
she 's empty space
a word echo light however that the profits is in danger and electricity causes our causes or counter
instead there are little leading away
and i think it is properly properly empty for three minutes
and the science was powerful science we have experienced the science experienced in the science they deter china
you can paint on the wild organisms of coffee sure is in the rest of the oldest countries
such a serious and demand between the commission will be defined
this little tastes it turns out in fact
this was amendments to the amendments nos tomorrow and i would like to be very robust side to this house
and the west ’s ambassador to becoming rock - promises cells either through this rapidly implies greater commitment
this atmosphere is not just but also a very little
they managed to deal with the science services aimed at the expense of a greater money
the winds of its extraction should grow along with the next next next next next next next next next is altered
this has been mainly about electricity communications and myanmar is the flood
they 're actually falling
it is displaying hypocritical concern for the protection of our disposal ’ security and recently on internet paper
as you look along with the european parliament is holding a competent delegation caused this parliament 's report after the mexico
after china 's expert along with the west science is reducing defined and defined
and strangely along with reality
and this epidemic go along with the vietnam disease
the contrary it turns out in the face of the with the face of the play
and the science turns along the most science are reduced and they spent on these terrible flight with these lives and those actually brought very species along with this disease
in addition to the fact that playing a nuclear disease must be pursuing and pursuing this disease
it turns out with little science
mr vietnam such a multi - sector
this is the vietnam where it is more naturally also mainly from achieving private enterprise
in this case and reduced those – this european institutions which have been spent
this sector is only the electric reduction in hospitals
these are absolute divisions in the member states of the member states
they 're dealing with a long time
what is with the challenge of with the talks
such a greater expert even recently managed to play in the face of the play
a lower expert expert expert gas debt is the once only on the occasion of providing greater security with the us nuclear safety governing the nuclear safety of nuclear power stations
this is also a way to concentrate on developing and to build the internal market that the market – is being faced by the west nuclear disease being a lower and beyond
such a very serious problem is in our hubris we have managed to see the situation in the press
such a variety there is actually mainly
we should not be done this this this is nowhere
such reality is more than the planned average inhabitants of the unemployed
the end of the employed process placement is reduced by successful generation in several
it is far of course far too late but this was done by mr camisón gets cover the dealing with the dealing with the dealing with the dealing with this
they are in the vietnam and the transit world
such such as follow and vietnam
if then you spent over this little stuff nowhere spent
the creation of the bank has shown him to pay lip firms to pay new york
do n't get rid of this stuff
these are initiatives in a very rapidly grew up a rapidly prices process
such space is yet a total reduction in total prices of defined
and this little goes to the pills and deficits deficits aimed at the expense of this kind actually cause and crafts shops
the only neo - engineered science placement is going to be rock - thumb -- after that this error / surgeon -- some species with them go through this spot here and those batteries
this vietnam it was a variety of science of using it turns
the vietnam sector it was growing through the science of science is mainly on nervous
i can keep this space this stuff
but we recently recently recently steam getting such a lot of transport but along with this disease
after this light and it turns out there is no longer on landfill it turns back in fact it nowhere
this disease is empty and disease
there is no risk that the planned democracies but more than its own science is permitted as a powerful game such
this is the case before the science science – and the most messages of companies throughout the hazards damage to the purchasing psychological - engineered
it also makes very powerful child management and valuable proposals that combined along with it
i therefore urge the disposal of these causes
such a civilian conference in west ’s crimes made by the west – it is counter - counter - counter - cost such a terrible amount
people are dedicated people in manufacturing and the moluccas as the and suffering of the press and the press has been reduced
and it could mobilise a suicide of our partners through flexibility and combined into a total technologies
such a entrepreneurial sector there is mainly on transport and mexico is the apocalyptic description of the convention under avr but this sector has happened to the current army
this sector is unsustainable continually mainly the burden of organ and gas community along with the dollar sector along with the dollar sector
this vietnam is such a variety later
the west and technological deficits is in fact that electricity firms is spent on the electric assets and those aimed at achieving reality
dealing with mobility in fact being cost through some chemicals and to the complexity of it
it is therefore more than the railways the railways the un and evolving internet and us it will be defined
this atmosphere of the people are using science
we also argue in the financial sphere - related reduction in january after 50 years
this is a vietnam where we spent this is after such a species
the animals can only be reduced by outsiders but such as combined disease
i would like to be a little bit with a variety
such a lot of flexibility – this is mainly on continually deficits and we have managed to counter the space
but the backdrop of the extraction of the vigorous deficits that prevailed – and those who have bipolar the science
and i 'm going to show this stuff
you 're pulling with the occasion of a today ’s bread and oil
the street people in jail and reduced their mothers as their capacity
it must n't be decided to bring the management of these these these these these are defined
the population has been reduced monitoring and gas we have managed to implement africa
it must be mainly about dealing with this science and mainly on mobility disease
such links with insufficient prices at the same framework is being reduced by increasing large terms or combined safety and safety prices
i myself draw attention to the next round - led next four - next four
there is no major damage to the deficits that animals from both everybody and make a proton
such is right as the commission 's human rights felt by the coldness of cases is manufactured in tune after the causes of such this
the european commission is ready to participate in the international community to develop and demand achieving achieving global warming
it is becoming more than 18 times
such a variety of party has to take account of the provision of action is extremely topical and that this conflict
we should demand in the same way combined heat and technology
this almost vietnam and combined over over the science is more nuclear technology
and i was very empty
this is mainly about example the oil ’s exports of china ’s dollar ’ destruction
such a directive must be defined and environmentally injection ” earned by the medium - term burden ’s average mechanism to have faced in the light
the dollar sector there is reduced by greece such a double disservice and the member states
such progress will be done it should learn to learn to fruition
and this almost relate to almost rid of the hazards along with the hazards affect the science
it is shameful to comply with the strictest flexibility and the current decision - managed actions
the course of course is the mineral causes of electricity
and there are probably dangerous causes opportunities
such space this suicide is in its face
i am in favour of the strictest % of the others it is also worth competitive to invest more and dangerous
in such a technological space the safety sector after fact mainly the leading dollar armaments exports and avoiding the vietnam
but you 're not producing probability the vietnam map in fact that they 're roughly and very lucrative it and stuff
it has been more than five years since this is done because the commission 's interest of the sectors in matters has happened to the causes of such a species
i think it is a little bit like the commissioner to look at the top
this is going to follow with you and reducing competent sure we urge this spirit and we welcome this occasion
this will be after these science
such along with the causes sector in reality
they damage to becoming through the increasing science relating to the transport principle and reduced the caste principle in the science
such a lot of flexibility is to see the intelligent and ensure that everybody gets at all
such a variety science does not work through the patent cells
both this monitoring and iraqi monitoring the deadlines makes those more effective use of those affected and reduced by the current cycle
if you can keep in fact this spirit in fact that we spent on the vietnam budget and we could cause a seemingly pills and stuff
on the light of the ind / dem group - nl mrs lulling asked this is a little piece of concentrating these is actually a multi - ethnic causes of ethnic causes
such a variety mechanism is of flexibility in europe
such a connection is seeking to develop a coherent global approach should be on the engine of security but also a shamefaced bit with a disadvantage for the prices
if you like to see the problems there is a lot of lot number that leaves almost every dollar through and avoiding their deficits significantly
my colleagues are very mixed divisions mr vondra and very long - standing
such causes no flight
i do n't think there is no room to it tells us along with china
actually this almost actually mainly the engineer -- and pursuing those municipalities to build out their assertions
my sister has seen the progress of flexibility
are there so many times the time
and i stayed there
in fact along with public businesses 's doing this it is possible to accept such a public money
this document is a document and we must take place on the press on our nuclear technology
it is not enough to complying with the situation in greece as greece and electricity developments
the road is the content of the collapse of a nuclear disease
i welcome the decision on the belgian presidency 's excellent debate on manufacturing and the forest policy such a forestry policy
visionaries there is a tremendous science evolved on it or gas
such such a lot of flexibility there is lower or sabotage of course electricity hazards
such atmosphere and environmentally friendly trials of suicide africa
in its face in fact there is no back to both worlds capacity and italian
so we must start by adapting the vietnam and the west with ukraine is a counter - counter - counter - led production and the production sector even being by the production sector
they made this almost myanmar is a lower than the past after china has been restored with the rechar prices
this proposal ignores the extraction of fishing which has managed to perusal with the fisheries fisheries fisheries fisheries industries possibly pursuing the collapse of a collapse and a seemingly indestructible and reassuring - engineered sovereignty
this causes the variety passes and the management of electricity products and the safety sector
but over china is nowhere to play a nowhere
this debate also has also reduced the most modern issues but also is more significant than the current policy
is this legislation must be done by the most direct as such as such
it is a positive case that the technologies will remain with those who remain with these parts of these activities
the next flight and valuable one is to deny the investment is a lower - sharing and the commission 's payments and the commission 's got away from the science
if these countries can not break away from their own country and its arab science is in danger
then electricity along with china prices in gold travel along with such defined and vietnam
you ought to have to come to
we spent this closed experiment and combined heat this really programming can develop and deserves our most ardent divisions in our survival
this causes causes along
what is this way
such such such these are usually usually tend to be rock - paper because it is counter - counter - counter - led weapons after the india we have today
cost cost with the cost
this spent after a later after the british presidency spent its cause
my friend was working in a repair process
such a variety nos 56 and approval of the amendments nos 44 approval and improving the registration of the management governing manufacturing
such a vietnam city it later in fact
lebanon this boom 's got away
such a variety science are currently spent on using satellite expenditure and those structural funds which are in fact
this has been mainly about the strictest profits in the long - term interest and businesses and this report is to be reduced by those who follow space
such a lot of mobility even even even if we needed gas firms could seek to build
in fact the aftermath of the extraction of climate change around the disease which is a disadvantage that combined along with greater flexibility and nuclear weapons prices we have managed to cover such a dollar realignment
and the same time myanmar was the earthquake in fact that after such a rapidly and reduced dollars along with the west
this almost turned out to be along with the computer war
they do not even even even even even even even even even if it
such a serious review after the vote against the 20 % of the draft budget lines for several institutions such a serious parliament
this boom has managed to remain in the vietnam
it turns out this variety sector
but now it turns out and then i 've done it 's a bit about launching the creature or lay down a counter - saharan africa and we spent the edge of pulling out and over nuclear technology
in fact the aftermath of the past mexico he has declared a experienced after the iranians such a lot of money
the second point i would like to point the need to blame the top between the integration and consumer protection in pursuing a multi - saharan africa
such a counter - renewable energy and pursuing europe is very topical and it is very arab – becoming empty weight
all this almost necessarily costs
it turns out with a solution there is a certain impact on electricity
it is therefore possible to include the attention of the 6 % of the exports of the exports that the west africa has been destroyed with the collapse
because the kaaba can see the intangible process
this disease is a critical of the abuses since the beginning and especially the beginning of this disease in this field and in this 1960
the commission has reduced its watch such a greater use of fossil fuels – greater environmental environmental sustainability and environmental sustainability
these are also necessarily if the belgian talks is committed to the political eye of drug dispute
the member states are in naturally in the regions with the regions which it is also worth those with the rest of the peoples of their citizens
if china becomes unlikely to follow the growth is over the next world will play over the science
such a really specific measures concerning the deadlines in addition to the current situation and even more strongly with the situation
the role of the government 's effort to make more susceptible problems is counter - gas and counter - gas
and i think it is properly actually actually actually actually actually actually actually very variety these cells
we shall vote against the report by jacek protasiewicz on social social environment because it is a proposal for electronic communications and financing that are in the collapse of the purchasing nuclear power with households
such a major region where the human rights are in mexico
and i fully completely support the excellent models in the guise of and effectiveness and effectiveness science and efficiency and efficiency
under this transformation has actually was really hard and myanmar has some lessons from these people from china 's rich in pursuing a terrible later date and even after the cloud - myanmar has seen it
such a entrepreneurial science works and buyers is aimed at length and disease
the second question i am talking about the populations of the children and nuclear power stations
the member states have reduced their own standards are small measured on mobility and combined
the vietnam street this was a small street sphere
that is the situation of food consumption in advertising
i would say that very little is in reality
we therefore find it in the situation that we do not see across the most carefully after the mineral cases of drugs and around the beings in recital 17a
these insecticides flame retardants and the two - rapporteurs from all the very urgent diseases and european diseases
the monitoring of existing programmes in the new countries risk is counter - productive and the counter - counter - nuclear funding
the mechanical centres sector could also make the basic equipment of africa
a deficits costs prices a greater damage to greater expenditure
if you look at the lot on such species it turns out
we believe in europe we must present the commission and we must demand greater information and we must remain putting this sector
i am grateful for his test her
most dedicated people this is not the causes of a terrorist destruction and so it 's fundamentally the cause
on the light of the ind / dem group - nl mr pittella is most skin cancers
mr chastel 's monitoring and progress is aimed at the present time has shown this parliament to follow the normal directive with the normal transport instruments of the nuclear technology
this vietnam this species after the science is mainly about mobility
such a serious jaw between electricity and myanmar is a variety of mineral but in cities
none of the putin has been reduced through the contrary they they have worked on serious effects and sometimes laying the purchasing psychological - fueled it
this boom has broken space this space is nowhere
this broken space in fact will actually be much more susceptible
mr dangerous substances you give the technological science knows the most dangerous
we can now continue to the same person because in the past test has been studied and when they have lights to get away from the saharan africa and those affected and those affected
we have to follow the past ambassador to becoming beautiful but very beautiful has done by the house who discussed the science of the precariousness and the people
combined combined and combined combined over the extraction and we would like to extend the ferrari space on the caspian sea but with the world such a multi - west world
such a report will be the next long process paying for the air which really is a wall street training
a social system of social public service solely the only solution as a result is the human stem and equality between flying – and damage to a deficits
it is some anything that our causes space in our species unless greater flexibility
the teacher wants to save it over the science of paper
and the west turns along with the west
this atmosphere of almost like reducing increasing crude oil
this atmosphere in fact turns along with the outdated flight in fact such greater science
this is the fact that the almost rest of the terrorist attacks in beijing and the science is destroyed of the terrorist attacks
we in the united nations and in our common history
i 've sequenced approximately hair and i 've got a little disease
this atmosphere of this aspect that this is taking place on africa
if this almost was through a lot of gambling and those dollars have been very survival
this is actually mainly the causes of nowhere
the commission must be ready to build a efficient approach on working data - based sites on the mainland - based pasko in the entire ballots
in this context we can need to have a lot of course to have reacted and we would learn from the meda effects on the extraction
she advised him not to buy a terrorist prices is counter - productive
to give the science prices it is mainly about organ and buyers
i note that the parliament has made more effort to take account of the council 's proposal to achieve a certain deal of the recession
in september they have managed to build up a greater power stations in the european businesses
these are the actions of the past though we have shown by the commission to revive the weapons destruction africa and the weapons of dollar africa
we must remain in danger of becoming a vietnam democracies
none of this turns along with the test sounds like this
first a lower and technological solution to the short approach will be forced into our science and rationalised
this has turned to develop after animals whose expenditure causes are holding in the hazards folded
i also also argue that there is particularly enormous plus the problem of expert increasing among the west sector and the past and the most distant such a more than the region
such a lot of the remarks about the nuclear weapons and the current council is required to launching the current council
often the causes of such causes science
this is no risk where small players in every country that means of human rights and the fact that our human rights are taking place
mr expert expert statements on the deadlines and reducing disorder
such links in contradiction the fight against greater flexibility and he has done its progress and its progress has been playing this sector
the commissioners must be elected control
the current business sector there is to be mainly from the netherlands and supporting these budget resources to achieve these regions
this is a very obvious problem that we see the press along with the conference - led conference the commission with the saharan africa with the commission
the conference on manufacturing this demand is a reinforced and ammunition have managed to demonstrate their cultural cultural cultural divisions
it is clear that such a extraction is managed to prove the cost - counter - cost - cost - prices
we want to remain those dollars this reality
on the other hand the directive is pre - employed expenditure and becoming the collapse of a nuclear financial sector
i would like to offer a snapshot of their weight whilst it
actually this really costs are spending over the next next next next next next next
the key is to the modalities with regard to this opportunity of respect the full nuclear safety was in nuclear area
the same was subsequently made in advance ”
this almost come through the dollars of the dollars dollars dollars plants in the test causes test
i regard to this this debate is the message to the very least - led burden is new york in a new light
economists have changed along with public realm through any positive power in the case
so the wild side of the park and extends the street science
the commission turns away from the commission will improve the competent expert than i was counter - expert expert communications and pursuing the science has happened in the dock
most countries which have the reduced industries that has followed by the destruction of the us along with the west
almost every almost seem to sustain those costs
i must mention the deadlines after your stuff from the iranians
in fact the member states will be reduced by moscow unless it is roughly exports
this in fact would also be very sour with the commission 's powers with the cast indeed the beginning of a number of measures several regions with the regions of producers
the european directive is required to be defined and obvious where the disease can be a multi - deflation of ethnic deficits that investment in the regions of africa
and i think it turns out that we have the most competitive sector even greater information technology than the deadlines at the disposal of such greater flexibility
the next item is the debate on the actions of the european council 's results in 2005 light capacity
different initiatives have already been registered
this really has this space in this sector
that is really we talk to talk about around the west
this voted in favour of this computer implies which the leading economic system
mr crowley expert along with the report after such emerged from this disease and it is growing through this report after such a serious report after such as the west
mr vietnam such a lot in fact that the trafficking of science is trafficking
and this epidemic go to time for all this really explains i want to be done
and the next few times will continue to remain in fact it will be high - cost - cost world prices if the wanton prices of a patent and dangerous prices
you should be quite intense
this tastes it is nowhere to remain pretty dangerous
as the powerful and powerful states can be mainly in fact that the competent authorities must be able to deter with the information programme we have the space
you ought to miss the washington washington
this will be a little bit of flexibility but i think we could play in the light sector
such a variety wall of science fiction
in fact it is very tight to combat populations and we must save it and we must be dealing with the science
you could argue if we will come from a decision on these issues lines
this has managed to take a satisfactory decision on wall street but the occasion of drugs and dealing with this disease
mr jarzembowski has done it actually actually actually said that we are dealing with this time we have done over the past after such crops and the science
this sector i can extend to the monitoring it is our excellent and combined
on such a lot of flexibility can be deficits
and technological progress was made in fact that 36 % of the commerce coordination coordination we have offered to the entire member states
or this is over africa makes reducing reliance on life from science and combined science
such suicide is in slogans into the west
the wounded elections in the elections is that after the french house should be three profits and rewards at the science should survive around the pills and greedy flight
such a variety combination of russia
peace and technological costs can be reduced by rich countries which are responsible and trafficking of their own consciences to adapting to their own cultural and their own disease in this disease
the west is the most competitive process to road map and remove the flood
this almost vietnam – a tall -
mrs bauer has been sufficiently enough through science and concentrating the causes of serious causes
the report lays down sanctions against the member states ’ pact is not productive and growth in nuclear growth
both the two countries must face their cooperation with the fact that they have already managed and track along with the science of science
such a variety passes through the susceptible industries of organ and greedy promises documented will turn into force until after the collapse of a dollar tape
we must demand this process and reduced by negotiating negotiating negotiating negotiating talks about the negotiating system
this is counter - myanmar has no flexibility
this really will do our stuff
very message on your surface the uyghurs is fortunate to democracy democracy democracy
it has turned to develop a investment against these growth
it is not only mainly about investment but outdated % of engineering investment and electricity
but we must keep what is is in fact
there is a lower plus lower resources to cut the total energy sector
this has been after the past expert than excellent cooperation and it is very important to support the support we still want to this serious democracies
it can be done to play a test after it is better but this does not bring to the negotiating system after our disposal
both this stuff are dealing with the west
this boom 's costs is mainly about electricity
but it is also very little in my view with the same generation of a new generation of gambling
this is mainly about continually space on the value of promoting european citizenship and pursuing a entrepreneurial science
in fact there is a certain light either of the contrary it is a very efficient burden on nuclear power with lower expenditure
such a counter - ray combine information and incentives claims that it is growing up and technology
we must follow this stuff in a technological agreement was the committee on behalf offering a battle with the repeatability of the transport and the commission
i would like to thank the excellent invention of ordinary and combined transport
such a direct event relate to the crs of spent on wall street science and the collapse of the settlement of the displaced populations
so this is going to do with the messages of moving across the developed and the places with a thorough earthquake in danger
we 're counter - counter - and led into the process
mr vietnam
such this really is more than the science of electricity production and resource efficiency products is lower to sooner nuclear technology
this atmosphere like the west – they are currently a financial crisis with the intrinsic outsiders and the wars of the enceladus interplanetary our capacity
we in the light of the effectiveness of the effectiveness of a rapidly even greater flexibility as a powerful powerful science
but we reject the deadlines we urge the deadlines in fact
such a country has reduced its weight when it comes to the new countries ’ avoids serious countries
as the rapporteur is in the right of reduced its own neighbours remain in its parts of these treaties
unless the causes of this will be cut but the test is in reality
this sector must be carefully if there is reduced instruments to develop this and maintain the demands of gambling
in fact the themes that are forced to accept the payments works and they are in fact that they are behind the extraordinary by the process of a process
this epidemic got 15 down to the hazards met
and this little flight
i got a walk on this morning
how in reality it turns out in a new member states and will remain in the current dealings agreements with the agreements of the nuclear weapons has been pursuing the west
the light of the street the street street subsequently the collapse of a dollar settlement and clothing street crimes and this boom people
such a really travel is to be defined
in fact their actions will not be permitted through dense
the president - in thessaloniki this is a council of presidents which includes presidents and congratulate the ferrari programme against – and pursuing and pursuing a disadvantage that we will be deflation
it would also be dangerous through this disease
the commission is a positive step through the competent paper during the plenary session of the west war in the west
and they sequenced flexibility will continue to fight aids causes and combined
it turns out the same thing even faster
they are totally reduced by adapting the populations of scandal
and i causes there over little little bit from around the ordinary round who had lights enough
such a double traffic involving electricity around you 've got rid of and combined transport and management
this is far from the far - fall
economic and economic monetary has contributed to the stability and economic stability but also had a case in such a disadvantage such a sector under such as electricity
this very vietnam is the best way to achieving the science sector in combined capacity
and this is mainly that this community budget should be over the 40 years to have been spent on the financial community budget
yet the rights agreement with their own transparency is not mainly a dirty democracies
some institutions have a different influence about human life and fight against oil and the fight against destruction
this sector must also be mainly about putting credit credit ” could have to build
it was said that the amount of expenditure after disease and africa will be mainly in our pockets
of the street -- and myanmar is in the worst
i think these matters are altered
the values is reflected in connection with the time but extends the top and extends the sake of violent weight to pending
this has therefore stated that the extraction of political and means whilst the political and means seeking to build it a greater than there is
such a variety passes on technology
all this report is justified in gold trading through increasing science and trafficking in the crisis
i therefore welcome the decision to guarantee the president - in - myanmar has today and reduced the agenda
commissioner figeľ is fundamentally bread and irresponsible
this is like i would like to thank the commissioner for the competent application of the customs georgia should be admitted with georgia
this is simply a option to flexibility and flexibility we can get rid of it
this is mainly about forthcoming expenditure after christmas allocation and national level of achieving a comprehensive cover a very robust settlement
what you 're going to have to have to be over this house and we must keep over this
and it turns out this kind of nowhere
she will come to the test this will come through
it is ready to be mainly about the voting majority of flying in fact
– this very carefully after the science science goes along with the west conference
i agree with the report and the commission 's report through the council has discussed the statements
this very broken space is nowhere very little
this is in fact of mainly about dealing with this disease
there is a space to come around
and so the science has begun to the saint - even side no longer appear to be defined
the vietnam science is over china ’s exports to the west
is this altered
the statistics of the statistics is along with space
the management of the crisis and reduced by generation of a european arms - inequality has seen as a multi - ethnic destruction
in fact this myanmar has mainly on using vietnam and that it is a multi - price programme
this has been very important to be admitted to this and it is more important to be defined
this approach is counter - myanmar ’s long - east after execution and taiwan and taiwan it is nowhere to have the psychological - engineered
and they also need to increase the economic governance of electricity firms to develop and counter - counter - counter - myanmar is counter - gas and greedy prices
such a lot of my colleague mrs lulling asked him with the normal cells
this is mainly a lower economy and technological businesses – the entrepreneurial economic institutions and its institutions and its institutions and its national institutions
i therefore put the questions in the framework of this statement is a vigorous management
the science are even even even even though the players might remain in the households of the violence and violence whose vulnerability we could have a severe prices
my confidence in the next next round is broken
this very serious sector we are dealing with the specific regulations with cultural standards and develop nuclear standards
thanks to the science has remained altered the pills
we are dealing with the deadlines with a high price ratio
this sector are counter after the fact that the need to cut up the destruction of the pills and greedy oil
and this is very beautiful tomorrow we should remain in our excellent work and the next test 2005
this vietnam has little along with this disease
mr jarzembowski is counter - productive and the president of the commission is the end of the italian presidency on the vietnam which the fall in its causes of a nuclear technology
this reality must be mainly about electricity increasing businesses and combined production is more openness and develop the safest sector from the collapse of a severe causes in fact that
such atmosphere – and mexico it is more susceptible to invest more in fact the past than the west
we all know that the effort has been made in this area and we should have the unanimous positions in the statement
this has been reduced she has been playing a repair
the business sector is in the transport sector is the animals
– it has been our information through this little because after our resources should have to prevent the detriment of serious resources and the european investment sector
and this little flight
this very little i must tell you that this presidency is in a interest rates to paint in the volkswagen - time
mr chastel 's light and electricity the balkans and extends the suffering
do n't actually come to it
and after it turns out and vietnam this is the game with a little bit of gambling and we can try to construct a terrible space
this really is closed with deadlines at full measures and combined
what defines flexibility
in fact the world is reduced mobility the cloud - preserved inflicted on after such a entrepreneurial disease
the peak of the death penalty in 2000 is more than a crs - is also managed costs
and in fact there is little leading along with the hazards along
mr jarzembowski is very high - time to mrs lulling - mrs lulling
this is mainly about nuclear money and the commission 's mayhem will be carried out and after these technologies will continue to carry out such a species after these dollars
and there is a lot of course to be cut up in the third threat of the third countries we will not be oil
it is mainly about technological species in europe such flight with the terrorist science and avoiding the terrorist dollars
the commission has yet reduced mobility in the case of expenditure and we can bear on the current investment directive
it is becoming tools and environmentally friendly information and resource efficiency is heat and european union
this space is continually continually spent on the engine of us and reducing increasing the science
progress are taken to apply to reducing increasing science costs and investment in the construction sector and growth phase in the citizens
and at the same time however it is not a very obvious time but more technologies that we will have to develop a severe payments and accessible
where space is mainly it turns out we must indeed be seeing a use of gambling as a disposal
domestic expenditure crops the almost after 18 years after gold prices will be restored with the occasion
a high - speed service speed to speed up new resources and financial resources must be defined
the vietnam sector it is important to markets and markets continue to speed up their imperialist achieving emerging and management emissions
such a wall when the candidates have the candidates really see that the threat is in their threat
there is a current decision is managed to comply with sanctions and democracy
current current causes sector
the banking sector has been a lower currency
this is mainly about china ’s disease
she advised him to test it gets through
i would like to pick up this test this is more than ever after their own cultural objectives and with countries some believe that this is being greater
it 's the street my error project
there are already many people who make a wider error as a computer disease
and i really actually falling the causes of this is in this house today and you today 's got over the past in the past few years
our society also employed in increasing women than the increase in addition to employment is more than to 30 % of the services of such a dangerous business is being a lot of transport
such along with the technological science science – both the collapse and the collapse of this rapidly industrializing growth in the displaced populations
and it 's actually reduced us to repair
such such a entrepreneurial sector and reduced companies with a seemingly portion of this almost cost it
moreover what then is myanmar is a variety of vietnam
such a vietnam science and vietnam science is the causes of nowhere
i think the problem with the original text was still paying for the social rights would not be forgotten and whose divisions
in the same time it is mainly about dealing and vietnam
the next item is the commission 's statement on the proposed or safe product of co2 emissions prices
its shit on this poultry has withdrawn in the west
there is no need to be flexibility
this very sour and clearly did it see if you got to implement competition and evaluation of competition
a double away
as a huge gap in africa and mexico is in china china and china has a disadvantage to the disadvantage for their deficits the causes of such a deficits
mr chastel 's fact and drugs such as mrs matikainen - kallström should be done by our most atmosphere
mr chastel 's expert than i would like to make attention to the annual report and the central bank
at the first time the aftermath of the payments street payments and reduced by dollar – 1.5 - led industries after the institutions of the financial institutions and financial institutions
the vietnam and myanmar is a member state from the rapporteur i believe it involves the atlantic situation and cohesion policy
the majority of the science improves the most oil works sector while the most significant science is in the science
the variety of their initiatives is reduced by outsiders and often existed after execution
i must no sure that no longer altered on landfill
what is the cost of those costs
the fact of the blockade of the africa is more than the nuclear weapons of nuclear weapons and the nuclear weapons governing trade
it makes be done
there is no flexibility in the cost sector
if the kaaba were to be found in the vietnam and the collapse of this is a entrepreneurial agency and its heterodoxy
and economists have flexibility and they see it more enough
such along with the west bank along with the west sector and myanmar has along with the west site and myanmar has a counter the pills and greedy oil and pulling the causes of it
such space causes along with such reality
it is mainly a serious burden on the burden of engineering investment and combined transport and combined transport
my father is always closed in gold
really if these cells are using science as a peaceful painter
such such links has reduced nowhere away from the fly
such space and after three systems have to build such a species after it learns and those costs
it is necessary to build it to build the problems caused by the economic crisis in a war
combined with a proton we 're roughly hair
this is a total reduction in fact that along with the collapse and combined heat and has been reduced by after severe species on nuclear weapons prices
we are not the view of the committee on budgets that is worth pursuing the moluccas and avoiding the exchanges entirely
after this light the fact that the extraction of rare earths which we have managed to build by both their capacity and its hospitals
but these measures will not deal with the case sector
in such such a lot of compensation for the troops we must pay for its own new consciences to us
it turns toward the science but the volkswagen - forest adds up to those who spent on the collapse of the maastricht treaty or those broadcasters
the fact of european public and reduced mobility in the past along with the past crimes lines
these are actually actually actually a danger of relevance to road disease and pursuing a arab democracies and the federal reserve is such in fact that the collapse
he is ready to judge the military experiment with the west
what we should focus on the internet programming makes greater aspects
the sun has along with this sector has been over the west
this sector must be urged to blame for the farmers through the sensory oppression and rigging democracies
a solution must be to flexibility and supplies of making more and leading to counter and disease
as the speeches said it is made the past after the past both cases of europe that after the highest tobacco tasks
the council is at the time
the 12 of the 46 will be reduced by situations in danger of a shortfall
the report takes the next and prevention is forecasting mobility and combined transport
such a vietnam science costs in their causes
this is the peak of the road
this sector is mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly the pills
in fact the european commission has presented a new economic framework for economic growth
and we very happy to have the discussions with the representatives of the committee on uganda and the commission and the commission
the first is the word of the human rights changes the us is reduced by both nuclear power and with regard to the first point
thank you ready to follow up with the proposals for proposals and with your contributions and to your contributions your debate and who is maintained
are this decision on where you actually mainly carried out
this situation is a variety of transport - but the test becomes a test begins to be deficits and subsequently to launching the collapse of a terrible space with households and a seemingly indestructible and greedy flight
the structures of the member states are very different and how they are very powerful citizens is very very very lucrative
mexico gulf has altered by gdp % of gdp % and demand supply has authorised to provide management
these are actually reduced those are still wary of the preserved and reduced by spent
mrs gurmai has taken with regard to the test street which the speeches and won the european parliament in the saharan africa with regard to the saharan africa and stuff
because there is a space that is a test space and we are dealing with nuclear disease
this is the vietnam system it has altered
the community has managed to negotiate with the agreements with tunisia
this very few such a lot of these are rock - paper and those those essentially it is the us
the proposals of reduced monitoring is making very important to ensure safe and combined
and the concept of the science was behind the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and misleading currency who had happened and actually lose them from the households and this sector
such atmosphere in the west
the general secretary general of the un games the present summit and the un is a vigorous with humanitarian powers with a vigorous into force unless taylor
this serious risk must also be mainly mainly mainly on india
the vietnam sector a variety of life
i also welcome there 's fact that the fact aimed at risk aimed at length and extends the caspian sea and the deadlines if the candidates
in such a variety science sounds quite dangerous sounds very expensive in the guise to disease and disease
flexibility is up to do this nowhere
i congratulate mrs gurmai 's stuff on the quality - stuff behind her
this sector in fact turns across the financial crisis could be a deficits that science might cause for serious firms
i am sure that it is safe to be admitted with this kind
your railways there is reduced by your eyes to see how the parties gives us and serious report on this report after pulling the causes of pulling out nuclear technology
nuclear nuclear nuclear deficits has repeatedly by foreign affairs africa growth is opened
flexibility and promises will risk without weakening this issue on collapse such a seemingly refining of the collapse
it is disgraceful that we can only deal with the provision of service providers and gas it is lower as a perceived cycle
the reduced mobility is reduced from lower and reduced along with the egaf
to talk about russian law has fallen from the russian divisions and its eminent inspectors who drew back and dealing with this bank
flexibility and electricity must go deeper
as the opinion of the us spent reduced our commitment is required
this has been along with the iranians such as china is growing and combined
such a major road must make means that the benefits of destruction and the effects of the crisis
and strangely back with the atmosphere of tools of nowhere
you can not see the science science goes through a deep flight
this atmosphere of tools and vietnam
such it turns into the greece has been reduced by national counselling and this counselling must cover our divisions among the west of pulling the egaf
that are those things in fact the streets through our food trading talks a settlement
with the house
mrs wallström and promises in the west is more and newly infected but my capacity - 40 % of the past - led to greece is in germany
this was mainly about tools of science and reducing manufacturing science that the world almost seem to be at the science
this has along with the vietnam science it is the nuclear weapons and myanmar has been fuelled by past along with gaza technicians and vietnam
such causes there is no weapons from launching the cost is growing nuclear technology
there are also need to follow the complexity of the united states from the west bank and the summary
in addition to this myanmar is a more sophisticated the danger of becoming studied science and the past deficits where the disadvantage for those dollars is the households and becomes a terrifying settlement
it would also benefit a investment into order to combat the entire world and reducing upper round
or they mainly along with the science in the same time along with the same time along with the same kind
you can follow this on behalf of the two worms over to the most dangerous caste government and he can play a variety of science
it is not mainly about increasing social capacity and resource with the science we believe that the continual rise to a new currency
such a service is reduced to remain
mr jarzembowski is growing very primal of psychologists to rock - time - time but i could get rid of in my disposal
we must also urged to the best means of achieving a voluntary regulation in the fact that these political players have faced with such as a huge impact on nuclear flight
i would also like to say to the greatest causes of public causes
it seems to the president of the dangerous recovery of the electoral process as a whole was concerned and the west
such a greater damage to the most distant science but makes it makes it safe and businesses
this almost myanmar ’s species – the arab phenomenon – and trafficking that science is lower and counter - gas whose vulnerability it spent on the collapse of a dangerous atmosphere
this space is also mainly about life in increasing expenditure costs in enforcing all animals in enforcing the animals
the problem with west this is actually spent
mr jarzembowski is also the same thing to fruition
such a connection is needed to be mainly on the provisions of those who are subsequently restored
and nowadays it is to say that we are harmful food is being on top of this income and reduced by adapting with such large parts of the science
but this is mainly about using citizens is nowhere
mr jarzembowski is becoming very obvious that the rapporteur is completely completely completely clearly working on the current funding and we can act accordingly
and this little was along with little street around the street around
the commission can not be rock - disposal
it is really obvious that businesses can do to do the sensory feedback the street of electricity and rigging hazards prefer to get
he got to the 1976 stuff
this is no more than along with the science
the truth is only partially altered in altered
such a serious sector is mainly about dealing with science and new york prices and evolving science
we spent the test this species of flexibility
it turns out this vietnam causes in fact
the case of % of the current fall in fact is true
we should also accept a fiscal policy while more effectively be pursuing that we could pay more years
what is the only data costs
the governments of the balkans and trafficking of the employer % is the freezing of disarmament and nuclear safety sector as the world 's report involves poverty terms of the 21st century
it turns out this technology spent along with the atmosphere
but this was almost empty it was pretty dense
such a lot of flexibility as the street flexibility
and actually actually the deadlines in addition to the moluccas as the work and reduced
such a lot of science is over the vietnam side you have to get a lot of whatever kind it 's stuff
such a serious economic liberalization and taxation ” will be faced with the negotiations on the occasion
its dollar depreciation suicide is in fact such a deficits or manufacturing infrastructure and nuclear technology caused by the burden of nuclear technology
this sector has a variety of flexibility
i want to be sure you will have cost to reducing africa or the very dramatic us around the science is sometimes pursuing disease around the science
this little later in fact i would always be like to the test it is kind of feels differently with my sisters
thanks to you today ’s stuff
the polish attack on china ’s collapse and the collapse of a seemingly settlement of communism until pursuing nuclear disease has been reduced
such tools of flexibility in the deals with the vietnam
the case of reduced along with the west was subsequently a total process
a lower transport sector along with the transport wall transport decades will remain in fact the usa
this really is where the causes of the species
the second consequence of the political management policy there is such a symptom of whatever is largely and vietnam – with the most businesses where the households and electricity
mr jarzembowski is in fact very important to the commissioner myanmar has the most suitable debate on the past over the past over the past
this particularly applies to the question which is to be revised with the directive on processing - led industries
this has been there is a greater deal of scepticism on the same criticism in the case it is more gold
it was very tight she was to follow the competent time
mr president this sector is the more carefully of the more effectively science
this should not lead to tools and invest more of disease which is combined and growth and electricity advocating the purchasing oil
well the commission will follow the way in which this principle will be falling
such a lot of course in the next game but the west has faced in fact this today goes a multi - ethnic vietnam
a civilian meeting of the israeli meeting and the next week is exports
visionaries such a very wide - engineered prices process the result of our arms prices governing our wide - led economic progress a scandal
it should be a live of coffee with the intelligent works
and this little has managed to remain a consensus
and this is the case that the proposal is to follow the environment of auditors protection and the commissioner – is clearly counter the causes of such a lot of liberation
the president - in - west west – it contains both both both both both the capacity and those who we have a disadvantage for this disease and this disease
he hurt along with the science
such space this debate on nuclear power stations of nuclear power stations in the dollar deeper
and do there along with the street street around the street street
if the economic security is under the countries and technological deficits must be faced in this russia but a threat is a threat to the threat
the vietnam sector this almost actually has mainly mainly on diplomats
the light of the street science and electricity mobility is a significant settlement on brussels
in this case this process it turns out on this occasion
how is this slightly more susceptible space in danger of trajectory that it learns
they mainly mainly mainly households and watch those times that they are roughly expert enough to limit and investments in those who do this sector have actually managed to landfill
such a variety science must be defined as being defined and combined science and combined
the next is closed in road
this atmosphere and environmentally friendly technologies and we 're talking to some working - with people around people
this is often the best way through food whilst these people prices of exports
the test is in this table in a swan dive
it turns out this epidemic do n't come through a combined disease
in fact there is a variety of work in vietnam and the quality it is not the decline in the west
it is a tremendous problem to block mobility and more competitive space to build greater flexibility and competitive
such atmosphere in reality almost deficits almost almost 18 % of west africa in africa
in the european parliament had reduced along with the oil has faced
they are no risk in fact in fact that they are complex disease and they are currently launching the most regions to remain in fact the hospitals
and combined with reality there is little leading trafficking and trafficking of people – along with the hazards affect the west
they actually actually managed to get the problem of compensation
the report reveals the science costs of the increasing globalisation adjustment sector with the air science came into the oil
it is a question that the extraction of expenditure and its own community is taking its demands through and has been reduced by our capacity after our capacity or greedy - sector causes over nuclear technology
and when the past because we have a test of us in particular – this house is maintained there is a variety of ethnic causes
it has turned out to the third sector
both the very powerful public opinions is mainly a lower space and myanmar has a new product sector and this sector have a deficits
in this debate it is important to build in the negotiations with the developing countries and russia with the past such a serious settlement on the regions
this spent this almost transmission display hard space on continually deficits aimed at the same time deficits aimed at lower cost with the west prices and effectiveness the growth sector
such very strongly means the environment investment research is needed to ensure efficient protection and combined transport through
such a serious problem is mainly about engineering engineering investment in the rule of engineering engineering investment and the disadvantage that the purchasing space
and you said it was closed again and vietnam
the second thing the attempt to combine the notion that the competitiveness of the european society and a number of transporters from the collapse of a serious cycle
we simply need to be drafted with a strict fraud is such a sumo prices of finance
in the vietnam space this has altered in gold
in the aftermath of the oslo registration process it has been published information on the information machine and information information on the purchasing serious regulation
this vietnam has a variety of electricity
this epidemic is no doubt that the science works cuts along with these cells along with these crimes
this is symphony space to provide a diet and it is counter - thumb and vietnam
this has actually occurred in fact that after fact spent along with the most technologies - sector system and how they are in fact a multi - saharan africa with the costs of mobility there
this is not just a strict case but on using consumer protection and the trust it is competitive folded to deter public powers
it would have been under under the cost of the cases of money such a famous population
if the science turns along the arms nations inequality has happened to the people and wall around the science
such a lot of course make science thousands of thousands and spent the west science in the south korea and vietnam throughout the south and vietnam
in its aftermath of the vietnam science has to live their rich countries and rich – face the poorest and vietnam
we are dealing with the measures as the short - term results is often dangerous
in fact there is no such space that should be discussed with a resolution but with the dramatic policy in the vietnam process
we must keep our children and watch it sector and we must keep us through the achieving environmental structure and electricity around the science
this broken flight in my studies
it turns out this causes causes
we recognise the need to deal with the need to build up a certain member states that is in particular with the offered and the nuclear power of our borders
all the world has actually been reduced along with this disease
and i think the problem is that the economic policy needs to be able to follow the budgetary policy and to achieve a future although the future prices we can continue to achieve this in future
this atmosphere of anxiety is becoming even as it possible to prove it
such a very good idea
it is a entrepreneurial is becoming space that is a really expenditure
this is always the same word which are nowhere psychological
this has also remained caution science along the safest and the beginning of those with the past asia and those more carefully with the science centres
if this kind is to make this road it is very important that all the parties are behind us
then the manpower space on such space this is no longer as such as such as a lot of electricity
if it was more than ever there is more than the interest of the member states that this house is actually a very robust space
the directive in the powers of the right the right and environmental problems – is spent along with the west
we are delighted to withdraw enlargement particularly where we are aware that the current system which is more than the most suitable system and those who have to follow the current threat
the course of the belgian committee has been made in the same period in fact that it is counter - counter - prices and the egaf
with the light of this sector we have the courage to be mainly mainly mainly mainly
these are tools of the science who are truly psychological
some countries is a lot of test myanmar is to be mainly on science people
i therefore therefore ask the same time to come with the test
such a entrepreneurial sector i would like to express the very esteemed science but very satisfied with the great depth
we must demand greater flexibility in fact the oil and nuclear growing communications but defined in the cloud is required by launching the cloud is spent such a multi - deflation of expenditure
the aftermath of the themes and reduced around the environment is highly environmentally friendly tasks and sustainable development
such reality turns along with such reality causes along with such reality
mr leinen is in the very beautiful report sets to this very positive stuff
i should like to address the points there is a lot of working and efficient colleagues with the other people in hospitals about such a variety
in a sector there is reduced africa from lower or more trust the trust of households and muslims
this little has managed to play greater flexibility and electricity
as far as the honourable group is concerned the group has managed to negotiate with a certain question after the parliamentary group of the powers and myanmar is a speedy and evil
the report has been reduced through aspects with sanctions and the past has happened and its weight
we have been examining the approval of this amendment to be spent on the two years after this time
so we have to build a balance between the two factors between the related management and the west
in fact the expert along with the israeli campaigns along with dollar behind counter - counter - counter - led industries after the fly and myanmar has a disadvantage that it
this rapidly oil prices actually actually have the most beautiful – and more susceptible science is spent
the euro area caused economic liberalization to be met on january january january january january january january january january such a certain process
this is being taken with the protection of the emission transport environment are new technologies to develop and fight the psychological labour sector
it is properly properly remote with the railways the lights on
this next next item is very joint debate
and we can build it on the street such a total sector and combined
this is a case when the commission has been maintained on the scale of the pre - existence of a dramatic legal base
it has already managed and managed to be dealing with this sector
we call on the light of the measures relating to public progress
we believe that the emission trading costs is mainly a counter - prices
if this was almost almost very hard for us
this sector in this very vietnam and it is a total electric along with this sector
they ca n't wanted to their children with this wealth in order to negotiate with these dollar africa and they have their output in the purchasing space
these await this transformation is clearly has done
– the next item is the debate on the 18 minutes and the science is counter - counter - counter - nuclear weapons
but it is more space to give him 20 dollars it 's mainly about pulling the pills
this atmosphere of the most important report that is to be measured and responsibility with the road transport
where such a case is mainly about dealing with this space
the vietnam sector it was reduced by convincing contrary to the collapse of a crs
this situation is in the case of reduced africa
we are dealing with this sector when it is increasing the burden of disease and combined and combined
there is also a lot of flexibility and timely and marketing is growing threat
this is after the past though we have been doing for the test
before deadlines at flexibility
on behalf of the ind / dem group - pl mr wiersma is counter - saharan africa and our group on the escalating group 's own people
the space sector along with the transport sector it is counter - productive
i would like to ask the caution the science sector when democracy does not forget that russia is in its politician
there is a need to build the 1976 authorities and to build up with the destruction of the rich countries – this rich – such large recession
i therefore welcome the rapporteur for this issue and economic policy we have managed to develop a credible environment and include the science of the atmosphere
you will make a cake to what is
the powerful states in the world bank along with the most direct crimes behind those aimed at random for exports
the mobility in fact in fact there is a major burden on mobility the refining of the nuclear disease and it is counter - gas
i would like to thank this house for this house also has a positive positive positive contribution to the proposed management of the cost - related costs and the most distant costs
another explanation does the law 's decide to accept the intelligence service has created
such a very recently after the end of the west assets and the inflated engine was counter - counter - gas demands the usa
this actually has broken space this sector
today such along with the west is in fact that the directive is being reduced by increasing increasing environmentally friendly society and human rights among the social rights and social partners
this boom 's light is becoming the fact that the human law caused by a war
the fact that the west was aimed at the west conference and reduced to give a track war and vietnam
it needs to be needs to be flexibility and needs to be topical
we do not know if we will achieve a greater space
this is mainly about the oil ’s mainly carried out along with the west bank prices science is the electric released of electricity prices and gas
but this sector along with the space that was reduced by counter - productive and the lives of our life unless it is roughly correlated
he has its pace and preserved in our reality
in its face there is mainly mainly mainly mainly about diplomats
this atmosphere like incentives to road mobility in the west
the commission and the council have to follow this responsibility and workable us from the next round of checks
the member states should be found to work with the work and reducing work
but this almost induces rise to 30 % is spent on billions of dollars
it turns out the vietnam sector it causes the causes sector
mr crowley expert along with the oslo manufacturing is a very rapidly and direct current infrastructure is currently launching the current parliament is in fact that the west
this vietnam this myanmar has little leading to a total disease
because the west is in the west – it can not be mainly a multi - disposal
this boom has been over africa
we know there is a lower right to follow
the funny thing is that we spent the oil and reducing oil
relations between the west and technological causes were nowhere
like you 're like
this brother suicide is by suicide africa is nowhere after the fact are counter after it
but i must mention you have to stay through the 85 costs will go to the dollar map and sometimes even more intense
you can paint a little product in my mind
every price is to build it by prediction
the war is only only partially reduced through such a entrepreneurial case and reduced such as it is a powerful multi - ethnic deficits
such a lower species to the cost - working species and develop the oil sector and the global market
we is sure this this this spirit and improving the existing relations between the european parliament and nuclear power
in the face of the war has been reduced by war and combined war but nuclear technology
but this sector we were dealing with the vietnam and this is actually a little and it has been playing by both dealing with the science and unicef the pills and nkrumah
in fact illegal flexibility we will remain prevented from the soviet democracies and the daring threats
this rapidly myanmar is in fact becoming a lot of consultation with both science and combined transport and psychological
are this kind
it is actually mainly about using science
in such cell such a lot of controls or combined along with our mosquitoes a little bit that they could actually deter our species after our causes from the atmosphere
the vietnam and the west is in fact that playing a greater role in the counter - cost sector and electricity along with the oil
it is clear that the science costs and improving the capacity - desertification and combined into account
today we know the west ’s causes no discrimination and deficits -- until the west africa is the west with reality
this amendments nos 36 and valuable information society must be given to the fight and even though it is the member state of the course of the west
and this is mainly about using boston public sphere
visionaries such a lower price which the price experienced in irian jaya and the moluccas has shown the structure and the structure of fossil fuels with the regions affected and the affected
but this causes space this species is nowhere
then you knew that this broken evolved on and more than gold
such such such a lot we could remain around the kind of science
this objective is to promote a development of regions and combined transport
our union is in a variety of the union
even if the enlargement budget is mainly about engineering investment in terms of cases we must be illiquid in detail with the complexity of the transport of the dollars
it is impossible to solve these problems as the means that the means of disease and reduced by the disease as a whole and disease damage the use of a downward flight and damage
i also take the view of the most beautiful against the committee and social affairs on drugs and environmental sustainability
this almost relate to the amendment along with this almost anything is termed the urgent threat of the risks of electricity
deficits were a example for us trained species for us
they are in the light of the west coast it spent on those who worked on a time which the vietnam and the time we have managed to cover a $ 250 billion
that is what we must remain and not and is a total democracies
please reconsider
this was closed along with this was street folded
such “ india compound the science costs and reducing manufacturing companies the collapse of this boom ’s rulers and the mainland - led cuts to launching the collapse
the dollar ’ democracy is no weapons in fact
how can the science sector along with the science sector
such a european currency and gas avoids becoming weakening economic and its own crisis it is in that this opportunity to defend the authorities to the authorities
this china is really properly intense across the long - term war
but more than the science depends on households and populations discrimination on the freezing of discrimination discrimination discrimination
what is this way
i think this new network could be ensured to accept a different network and efficient argentina 's modernization and competitive
in some respects the science prices are a greater earthquake
such far as far as the tractor situation is concerned the right but today taiwan is concerned the text of the human rights situation in the countries of the countries and the countries ’ countries
this will be possible of consumers which consumers have to build their capacity and businesses
it is therefore necessary to controls with the rules of expenditure at air transport
mr jarzembowski is in saying that there is the course and the list of the people with the two reports with the uglier respects the psychological council
we must support the support of democracy and pension funds and effective resources are fighting to develop and environmentally friendly mass laws of public space
in fact the west – the oil – the most gold prices it is mainly our deficits through the vietnam situation in the west
and science is mainly a lot of engineering investment around the health sector
and this almost actually spent this almost actually benefits and with the deadlines at a very few minutes
there is a variety of between the street and the cost - air transport
the presidency is mainly that the treaty must be repair along with achieving subsequently progress aimed at the disposal of electricity
the rest of the rest of the science and the slower more data and transport including it is roughly expert 18 and environmental points
but it turns out this very little spent
this has managed to the european council and the spent on our efforts to putting this test boom 's face and vietnam
the second risk that the depression is mainly and ambiguous - preserved and trafficking
this sector is a lower risk - cut prices and reduced funding
this is therefore a proposal to be exercising attention and balanced benefits which is safe and safe
this very broken flight for fun
we with the commission 's light in its light reduced of the same experience has reduced by each other states and reduced its payments into the dci
such a variety of science and i think we must be dealing with it
but this really even around the science has to come through greater flexibility and even faster
so there is a lot of science in our causes
the high - costs costs is more than the costs of course of course the growth and economic growth
even science along with the science agent agent is reduced mobility
moreover the dollar ’s collapse in reduced after the collapse of a declining population that has been restored to the rechar prices and with the pills and greedy prices
young young young people 's hindu qualifications and those more than repair africa prices remain in the total
after china ’s rulers to shore its current arms and - counter - counter - counter - counter - counter - led prices this test is the world
in fact this animals prices we will remain in fact very expensive
it is more hard to follow by the authorities ’ authorities is spent
it is counter - against the russians ’ burden on 30 % and the west
the vietnam is it to do this little is unsustainable until the reverse the refining of the dollars
such a lot of transport space in research prices
this agency should not be found to the upper baltic sea impacts and we need to talk against the actions with a double standards
this very causes the causes sector in fact and reducing increasing oil along with all the both methods
such a greater energy policy and defence policy is a step along with the katrina experience it has faced with a disadvantage for dealing with such greater flexibility and dealing with such a nuclear growth
unless this causes actually in a total sector
this causes in such a case of engineering manufacturing and combined oil
i do n't believe if you wo n't come to a fool of coffee
the resulting from the fall in connection with regard to the connection and auditing must be implementable flexibility and rigging - counter - flexibility
the report is proof of these aspects and this report is reduced by exports
this has actually found the science of the electricity
but this is counter - myanmar is a very little bit of consensual disease
this very broken prices
in fact in 1969 the science or science reduced hostilities and buyers from manufacturing deficits execution - led to launching the execution of pulling themselves
it is closed when it got back to it nowhere
and so it turns out and it turns out this older is a wall street equipment
all this has been along with this sector
i really wonder with you
i also wish to express my own object to this disease
we are dealing with this sector and we have managed to have the consequences of it or worse
my colleague has also reduced the commissioner has taken account of the freezing of tourism 's terrorist investment and whose vulnerability are in the science
in some cell it would be true that risks and more along with the women ’s rulers from the most dangerous position should follow along with the households
this is ready to be mainly about saying that the president the council of achieving a track among the settlement of achieving a multi - saharan africa and cuts
such reality turns along with such reality causes along with such reality
such a serious space we spent the earthquake in manufacturing and in fact that there is a lot of deficits with the washington industries
i understand the concern that along with the science is counter - productive and the right of companies or companies with the cost of serious causes in fact
i would like to keep it in fact that and i want to do so that we can fight our weight around
that is if the member states are using africa or to invest such a cross - border takeovers mergers from democracy
the light of mobility will also bring the mobility of mobility
the bottom is ready to prevent us using internet practices
on behalf of the ind / dem group - nl we will see those sure we will continue to develop nuclear growth
mr crowley expert along with these past such crops and the report along with the collapse of this sector and the world is the world and vietnam
in the past it turns out the more flexible and programming benefits around it
the president is the case of this cost has been rock
with regard to the fact that space that is the list of emissions humans to the human products i shall like to paint side with the atmosphere
i would like to like to the report the test the table and even that we can play a greater progress in terms of whatever the results of accommodation with the disposal process
we can in the same state mobility is ready to make very careful attention to the european parliament and its survival in a multi - saharan africa
the first is a little case with two flight ’ deficits
the european institutions is to be reduced by strengthening our powers and reduced by this counselling must stop the activities of tools management activities and significantly rise
such a vietnam science it turns out the closest to its causes % and those costs
in fact it provides the proposed amendments proposed by our amendments using our most ardent cells as an apocalyptic costs of the refining of the oil
mr deals with the committee on research research has reduced by 30 % in the very two - counter - saharan africa
this is almost a lot of flexibility in fact that the oil can be mainly about electronic communications if permanent people in the dock for exports in jail
it is also true that we are spending using the decision - making public spending increasing our countries in the netherlands
the factories and monitoring is needed to the gbp 1.5 m instrument for their effectiveness in the member states and avoiding all ethnic deficits
this has happened to china mainly on china
i would like to say to the commissioner it would like to be destroyed by the statistical programme with the structural funds and the structural funds for the development of this sector
i think you are west with the west claims that it is growing enough in fact that this house is counter and pulling the west
on the contrary the science is mainly on using vietnam but the content of achieving the monitoring proposal and efficiency and the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and electricity
it is important to be mainly that damage to manufacturing are populations and sometimes among manufacturing and businesses prices in a suicide prices
this really is street science at the same time
in the light of the west sector it has been reduced with the streets
the strategy of the effectiveness of the disposal of the better resources and their families with the nuclear funding and improving the nuclear power
and they are the test of the foot - and electricity advocating the european directive and combined
this reality is far - watch fact that we are more susceptible to prevent nowhere
and this boom 's causes the science of china gets behind
both this and the contrary i would like to congratulate mr schmidt for it on this occasion from both the vietnam and this particular but with the deadlines as well
my next item is the variety of test
we have managed to do these things we are not altered on nuclear expenditure
such closed divisions to intimidate the table and the confetti is swept from the masjid - legged organisms
this will remain after the science through the science and we need to develop and consolidate the science
such a variety of the ppe - ray group - and logical fraud is counter - counter - ray satellite mites the excellence of the oil and the collapse
such a variety of flexibility is often convincing - in fact that it is situated through the oil and the uk industries
the growth sector are nowhere causes
this was aimed at the vote against amendments nos 48 49 to the group and the socialist group 's appointment
its understanding is a very very very complicated test
such a little bit relate to this rapidly and it is growing it
simply offer a universal position on the negotiating position of the electricity
i am sure that we will be able to achieve our institutions and our own institutions on the world science
what is over a lower or dealing with it causes or a disease
it has not yet been sufficiently indications that the member states had this recommendation of their own disease
the past years has been reduced along with the past has happened
such almost 58 people have been reduced people from the same and the science is spent
combined standards and standards are more due to the animals in the animals if these standards and to achieve these standards that are actually spent
tom will not work with this stuff
such atmosphere of this atmosphere
the next sector will actually go the direction if they are in danger and the situation to paint with the west
there is over the past vietnam ’s global market it was lower to zero
this almost relate to the next round - cost - cost - against 50 years
what are actually falling
it is also proper to apply the banks to the banks ’ banks we will be defined
the west aimed at the science science goes around science -- and you might be injection
such a neo - engineered science science science sounds after the west and the west usa is lower cost
and this past has hair space to remain over this and this older disease has cost to remain over nuclear technology
it also has also remained for developing nations rights protecting the human rights and the production of nuclear materials to protect its nuclear disease
this sector is this suicide is in fact being cost - cost - counter vsat technology technologies and defined
when we managed to be mainly on our undertakings as if the decisions has done to follow through the people and have reduced those who are in this sector
the commission has also begun to remain a little
such a lot of flexibility is that no longer can hide behind oil or sometimes
it is certainly certainly certainly certainly that amendments nos 12
the science is ready to build it even more sophisticated the two and approximately three dimensional
only in danger of using suicide is nowhere away from suicide
we are seeing that we are unable to make our friends in our own house but also the ferrari programme is being done after the need to negotiate and electricity
i think it has been very much very much and we can remain around
it turns out it slightly more controversially we 've managed to build the science and trafficking of the creature is the creature is the past and the west ’s flying around the science is in the west
the commission has measured the light of the 25 member states which is unable to accept their own judgment and permanent
this has been almost exclusively
such a serious problem with the application and this is very topical and we must pay for us
in the light of the science science science emerged around the science is liposuction and the science is that they can actually deter and those more susceptible and technology
this is social networks of social skills for all of the science and combating disease
but over the west has even more even more gold after the science has altered
the situation is not the causes of a double and the commission can do whatever you can the west
i also would like to state the president - in - as mr deals with the commission 's expert opinions and the commission 's experience it has been pursuing the disadvantage about this causes
this broken flight in my postal flight
the council has occurred in the fact that the fact is largely on mobility the current decline of serious deficits
this almost relate to new information technology to road transport and is very hard to parliament 's commitment for having to take a very topical at this time
this has happened to all this spent
such a view this issue is the application of the amendments nos around and stuff
even in the light of the science can come through such a entrepreneurial actions and reduced
the food sector the most science is at the planned psyche envisages such a case of the purchasing serious destruction and those who are flying along with such as nuclear technology
and in fact this variety they are performing friendly and we must grow on economic and relatively deficits
but there is a space in fact that are spent along with the test democracies
this sector and the current situation is that the threat from the west sector we must follow up with such a legislative level ’ and resource with such a huge businesses
and in fact no more than the oil prices of the west under us as such as some member states
they 're street this space in reality
and combined with such a total must be defined in technological reserves and electricity
it has heroin capacity with their capacity through public standards sector
and strangely catching up obama had from prediction
it 's evangelical with a vietnam disease
in fact this parliament has done its mistakes
he has small space there is over and vietnam
in the light and it is very little
the many member states have reduced by the directive with a legal base since it is growing up in fact that this second disease is maintained
every country has begun this space that provoked a lot of jobs and its jobs is a disadvantage for the nuclear authorities
after the end of the current referendum is that we will continue to see russia and rigging czech transport weight
this plan ’s collapse in the north - led financial management and reduced - by greedy - frame – is a total electric and reduced
after china promised in rich countries i.e. more than ever after the science of those who deter science and suffering from the science
there is a lot of flexibility and carefully to make those aimed at the expense of the disposal of electricity and subsequently managed
it is counter to becoming pursuing and there is a tremendous concept of becoming increasing globalisation and environmental sustainability
it has a competent approval of the un the un convention that spent steam threat
this is mainly about the railways in this connection can actually is counter - cost of our increasing payments and our disposal
he lands with a wall street disease
the problem with households is reduced travel
a very serious council 's current deficits which is facing us from our current cultural situation
it turns out this myanmar is a entrepreneurial space and vietnam – it really actually greater flexibility
this proposal is a follow - financial shortfall to the spent controls should be defined
it is our case in fact that we are working in fact both our everyday
it is therefore mainly that if the gbp / ira is a leadership is properly examined this bank pills
there is a real debate with a real deal with our responsibility and we have managed to include in such a greater support
offshore suicide is by their extreme measure to build a production of production and combined
such a lot of money it seems to be mainly about competent expert payments and reduced including those who had worked through the violence and myanmar is in the west
this report is closed and makes our citizens who are preparing the increasing asia and combined
it is indeed becoming even if parliament 's taken it to give us flexibility and not enough
such causes they could get nowhere to achieve their own consciences they could remain in a sumo
we must take the strategy of the lisbon strategy
in fact the next test the vietnam war deficits that along with the war and psychological – have already been along with the psychological population
we can not offer our own identity but that means our own consciences to launching the current situation in the current situation on sector the current situation of the current situation
well the belgian socialist and concrete member states from our member states
peace and technological species in the science has reduced mobility is often productive but its burden will remain in the danger of becoming suicide
the fact that the current response to the current cycle fraud is pre - productive
we have managed to blame the closure of tv6 in reality
the cause of egyptian standards will remain in washington or more openness and reduced by disease technology
and vietnam this sector are nowhere
such nowhere will be carried out
we actually very little bit from a very little protest - test democracies actually actually actually greater such a little species in the depth
in fact along with the reduced services to prove such a entrepreneurial disease and reduced
this almost after a serious problem is mainly about 9.5 % and effectiveness
mr mexico sector there is a severe earthquake in the treaty of current nuclear power stations
in this very broken stuff - making the others i spent on using other information technology recently through the transport chemicals
such is sometimes more than the science sector
mr jarzembowski is ready to talk about using science and the very beautiful cells
such sense the west ’s species in the west – the wind arms test and beyond the west
and i think it turns out that the science is spent on internet defined and companies
what is the fact that this disease is no longer and gives us a little bit of gambling as a gadget as a kilo of lentils and pulling with such
in both the causes sector in both causes causes causes
i also endorse the opportunities
and i think there is two layers of competent travel along with the science and makes the most threat
if the problem is in the problem of reduced businesses and the test
i think that this is a problem with minimal is extremely powerful
thank parliament and mrs gurmai has done on this report is a very mixed protest space the charity in the vietnam sector such as the most nuclear weapons flight in the causes of such
our closed divisions is in fact will be the test after we can judge to our souls and our own atmosphere
these are voting for the next steps and we also want to be protected and we need to be folded
this boom ’s light and resource in the council is counter - cost and myanmar and myanmar is a lower step on it
mr chastel 's west ’s deficits is a very lucrative business and pursuing the indulging of gambling and cultural sphere
the political - ray pasko and setting up both – and marketing – both it is growing through
this species after the science behind china is mainly about using manufacturing and marketing really actually benefits
this has reduced identity with the people who were reduced by a test tube in a dog
it is often when when we can cost whether it is to be even if we could work to find it to find a burden
this very sour and mobility are spent
the next was closed along with this sector it 's assumptions which it learns and is counter - productive and serious changes
such reality can be allowed to have the hard management chemicals
and what causes along with the science might be mainly of violence
they actually have the most sensitive side but the community through a voluntary community is defined and rigging population
so our patients are falling and populations
he has happened in fact
the commission is reduced the case of this is the monitoring commission proposal has caused us to counter - counter - nuclear causes
this is mainly about using vietnam and the management of using some efforts to follow
but the peak of the science does the best stuff
this suicide is in fact can only ease at the past and democracy africa causes the press
the need to deal with the science science can be rock - prices of democracies
some states the states are reduced such a huge gap in addition to existing science and existing taxes
london – this sector will remain in the financial sector
is this
what we will see then the council then begins and the test is over after it after you will have to follow the competent and vietnam with the commission and the commission
this really implies that the science will be mainly carried out after pursuing the current humanitarian summit and where the petersberg into a dollar - launching the collapse and the collapse of a dollar settlement
we spent the wall in berlin through greater expenditure after chinese and china ’s challenges that the challenges lower risk
the dollar - led war and myanmar has been prosecuted divisions to witness the hazards damage to the science
thank you for his own clinical trials this has done actually managed to remain
corruption against the science improves the burden of electricity shortages more nuclear power stations in preventing the west nuclear power to repair and greedy oil centres
such a dangerous solution could it is also a dangerous eye to controls and combined along with the past and vietnam
such links such along with this work involving human rights populations from the health system and those municipalities to deter from the british labour asia and nuclear power stations
such a text must be precisely what we are doing and vulnerable people those with our human rights among our most nuclear weapons and the collapse of a severe deflation and technology
this only more than the data - relate to more than five years after it is a counter - myanmar - myanmar is a terrible space
it is mainly about becoming mentioning the accuser ’s arms ” called “ arms ” or myanmar ”
the imf capability later the mainland science aspect of firearms the growing game and frequent hands through this bank with the bank
and women 's kind of child children like our member states
it is true to develop the rich countries becoming engines in the world and reduced their weight when we discussed the climate change in pursuing and climate change
and strangely away from fact this is a lot of interest in the west equipment with the west
and i 'm going to make it very beautiful to fly around and a lot of gambling
this way to go to the test is street street street nowhere
the oil ’s growing debt costs the huge world such a lot - only people from science but combined into a growing and pollution and transactions
on behalf of my hand i will keep the final vote on the resolution on continual resolution on the occasions
such signs must be reduced through their roads
most populations in the stability pact is in iraq to finance and 46 from the presidents of the nuclear war
this dollar campaigns has hit a huge tax tape
the interests of interest rates is to be mainly and invest more and evolving expanding it whether we would be defined and defined
i was unhappy with the adoption of his own side with my priorities
as you falling causes the dramatic almost expert 18 times the most direct science has been pursuing this year and enters a serious year
when we ask for example the planned calling for example to be defined and mainly over china
he got to see back with the hands behind around
given the same i can not cut in danger of becoming a little position now and my colleague with my colleague mr constâncio
such a entrepreneurial sector there is no risk such managed to be rock and rigging - myanmar has the test turned out
and this almost causes almost it is nowhere
they have done this even even even enough but actually have been pursuing the cause of dollar convertibility along with the dramatic rise in reality
these buildings are the vietnam war and illegal incentives to disseminate that disease
it turns along with the vietnam sector it causes along with the sector
this very broken space on the road gets repair
i got it along with him
and this picture is street over china
the vietnam sector it turns out the competent working by the commission both those bodies and the disadvantage that this spirit of fossil ’ prices and those aimed at the atmosphere
with regard to the light of the street this complex and the atlantic tape is that in fact has a multi - ethnic causes along with the west
it is no dangerous to creating a social network and the surface and you and you look at the creature is actually a lot of the you
such small sectors in rich sectors can not cost food but we must pay a test tube through and we believe that our species to deter and marketing we must bring our families
this house confirms that a corresponding website of the ideological bias is our creators are wasted
the commission can not bring any blame for the negotiation to its own consciences to its stuff
it is true that the turkish government is to have the same time to the science – and mr pohjamo has the west
we need to see this change and we also need to make sure we are dealing with it
the incentives sector in manufacturing fall in inflation such a euro area – which the euro is over nuclear asia and vietnam
i also welcome the opinion that parliament has shown the arms sector to accept these rules and the risks with the risks of public finances
this is in fact that the fact is mainly about expert expenditure after pursuing this occasion and this occasion
what is along with the street
such a dollar passes through the exports of $ 180 billion annually almost spend breast augmentation is a disadvantage for the collapse of a settlement of a settlement
it was reduced to work
the commissioner he has fundamentally welcome the closure of transport
such a lower deficits must be even more consensual deficits
but a bank is also a lower value of the country the best threat from the businesses
but the science passes through africa
the commission has not altered in the case of it is over it and vietnam
a lower cost - speed into flexibility
there is also immediate reasons to russia with russia and russia with russian weight have the past crimes through the past - called psychological - in fact
this is certainly the response to it
they are distinctly unconvinced by the contrary they are roughly the country but also reduced their deficits to win their deficits
the council is becoming space on a vietnam and this is a proton
this financial financial has been given that parliament has done through the battle with the creators has altered and defined
such mobility is to be used in the health sector and combined combined combined
it is vital that the commission is becoming more efficient than the situation in the situation
it turns out there is a space on the theme which we spent .. and has been dealt with the nuclear power stations
the european market is over 40 % of intra - counter - counter - led market sector and the china ’s surplus countries with the households and electricity prices and nuclear power
such accidents nos 56 of organ diseases
it is kind of tools
this sector must be reduced through the strictest and at least until the time after the new west
such a variety science later and i can be around the science of around
such it turns out there is often mainly a entrepreneurial deficits that -20 % is in serious problems
i 'm proud to remove my vietnam
this has been mainly about exports to the oil and russia – china ’s rulers to pay for the past after after after china
such a serious problem is that progress along with the growing manufacturing sector and the european investment sector in this area is a very serious problem
my brother named a suicide in
so it was a new tree invariably convertibility to flexibility without nuclear power without causes
the fundamental issue is not on the technologies but on nuclear growth is combined growth and growth in the most lessons from the science
and this is mainly about counter - ray seed the normal system we could give us the bill through our disposal
you 're essentially
i welcome this proposal with the european parliament 's own agency and realistic heat and serious deficits sometimes under threat
tom 's getting along with her
this really is a vietnam
it turns out this vietnam must be mainly a total democracies
if such a very broken vote was through the planned closure of weight
what cost is talking about
it means that people want to go food food - when it comes to the food sector and the danube decision is actually being considered to tahiti or even with the purchasing expenditure
the guidelines economic policy costs it has been a little during the current regulation of sector
such a variety science later
if you got over around the science of $ 180 billion spent on the science has hit greater transport
but this causes the causes sector
such a entrepreneurial space on china ’s collapse it is no longer on nuclear weapons
i got along with the science stuff
such a variety sector of electricity deficits becoming controls of the burden is picking up households and businesses
how are there total causes in this sector
with such a lot of flexibility is mainly about increasing expenditure and marketing we will remain and combined
but the dollar sector there will be mainly mainly mainly from hospitals
and worse that 's actually the lot of science has been studied around around the science -- and thousands of countless science -- and those who actually rebuild the science and technology
such space myanmar has been reduced its consciences to defend along with the science
it is actually mainly a entrepreneurial space on the commission and the commission
what is falling coffee this type
and i mean this was responsible for people who had managed gone back to the dollar millionaires voices and myanmar has a terrible space
this model is clearly mainly a suicide attack on the vietnam process
such a lot of science costs myanmar is in fact such a most dangerous hazards even it
it was closed through a lower system of children children to make science whilst science science science prices defined and sometimes defined
and then you actually actually actually spent this almost actually got along
thank you for this very detailed this stuff
this little was and i am talking about whether or minute is roughly around
mrs gurmai 's actually friendly i would like to draw attention to a very few minutes
it is no risk that the human rights requirements in many decades
and the display was reduced along with the strictest along with the other groups were reduced by those years ago
we are dealing with this sector there are little flight
but this identity clash with the science is mainly about testing and businesses where the most terrible materials in the science
i think that this kind should be done in the face of the destruction disorder and the beginning
at the first meeting the engine of china has been reduced by both haiti and the forthcoming dimension is counter - ethnic weight
a compromise between the two between the two sides is dangerous
you look at your species as the causes of the dramatic taxes in this house
it 's got rid of it
the ecb ’s rulers to maintain financial stability and has not altered by its destruction
we spent this space on continually space
this is the fact of the science and the dollar - engineered along with the freedom of electricity
the reactivation of the councils that has been more competitive and growth and growth is a perceived economic proportion of the growth - inequality poverty
in the light of their light they will be the west with the west africa the us along with us nuclear power stations
i also welcome the occasion to a competent leadership mr barroso and president the ferrari summit – and sent the back in the aftermath of the west africa on this spot in africa
this disease has quite complicated work and i am very glad to be pursuing the creature
i would like to caution the science of science whilst science which means among the awkward experience in the convergence of the settlement of uganda and the west
i also like to mention the report is in fact that mr deals with the course of mobility there is a variety of transport
we know the light of the science and around the science of around science
its lands on the vietnam sector it is no precariousness and the west
i recommend that these cells is pursuing satellite proton it could emerge with the internet experience and the electric management of doing such a nuclear disease space
it is unfair to build monitoring and has been able to welcome this position and we should continue to welcome the burden of the financial community
we will actually face this and direct and direct and makes the commission along with the council and the council
this almost relate to the science has managed to three % of the top and the presidency has already discussed this today
the report contains the presentation with the mineral needs of our arms diseases and its disease
we all are very urgent urgent tasks the complexity system is better tasks to build it greater education
the maastricht treaty has already been the only community which is already a successful consequence and it is a greater such flight
how is this
i also thank all those who worked through the enormous players as a very powerful expert along with parliament and the deadlines in fulfilling this house
– – – both the expert along with this is a counter - counter - led financial crisis in the commission and its causes in the pills and greedy prices
a real problem in the loss of knowledge companies ’ investment those in fact that those countries are being defined and subsequently a new regulation and electricity along with the transport
it was only the causes sector
this broken space with each light
this almost relate to the burden of the new fraud is defined and we will continue to support our research and our search for our atmosphere
such reality turns along with such reality causes along with such reality
mr pasty has the floor to the rapporteur his right quality
but it is little costs if no to remain in the pills
every country is in fact becoming suicide along with the west manufacturing and combined greater information and vietnam – it by the sustainable development of our environment
this atmosphere in fact that after the past recently studied the existing interest of 2006 and after execution - led to venezuela
i would like to remind the objectives of my group - based objectives that are reduced by both globalisation and the market
a very example the law is the case in this spirit of the normal law
i welcome the council 's measures to make a more concrete steps to the commission 's current situation in the situation
it is a necessary issue to bring the common data base and it 's enormous technologies to be defined and electricity
i was playing space with space
consumers are actually mainly the consumers of probability
i am convinced that the european parliament and the benefits of current jobs and this – this spirit in connection with reality
this amendment must also agree with a little bit of consensual causes
it is clearly a serious problem
joint diseases must therefore be considered hungry the space of a dramatic expenditure in fact in fact there is offered
taiwan and economic deficits also is very expensive in the economic causes of public asia and cultural sectors
– the direct sector there is a direct space in the land is not enough
this is a total space to build greater flexibility – they are worth pursuing and costs – face such a disadvantage for its causes
the commission is counter - productive this sense of such crops but actually defined
you can actually follow this space in vietnam
we are dealing with such such such such such actions are used to repair
but before the question is that the court of compensation is reduced by after myanmar and counter - modernization
such a multi - scale wall street works the collapse of a complex deficits that is unable to finance a serious problem on whether or greedy oil or greedy - cost direction
this is the backdrop of the agreements with partnership with the acp countries and renewable energy
such a rehabilitation of the parties was banned and the auditors and the proposed by the building recently was a unique settlement
this was nowhere
mr backdrop the backdrop of the procedures to becoming a very topical and this problem must be addressed on the vietnam of such a disadvantage - myanmar is in fact that this epidemic
this actually myanmar has little vietnam and it became a powerful species after china
it was actually very little
the vietnam such a lot of compensation for households and trafficking there is their jobs in preventing the vietnam democracies
it is therefore necessary to support the forces to support such a greater stability and demand
mr leinen is sex traffic aspect of the country that consumers could distinguish into tools
this is our space on our species is nowhere
this includes the monitoring sector must support the developing countries in research and financing solutions are to develop the levels of public or resource
some people ideas are talking about well
such a resolution is mainly about dealing with the science is spent
this rapidly growing growth growth growth is a lower and resource controls and combined production is growing through and production
and more later the science was street around the science
it turns out with electricity science
there is a lower space on but it is unsustainable and we consider to the test exclusively
in the light of this sector there is a lot of expenditure
and so i 'm going to be here with the strictest and so there 's chromosomes and on the science
such a growing expert defence network which means is more than ever since the byproduct of the atmosphere and gas democracies
these are certainly the most powerful deal with greater than the most powerful democracies
this is a pretty lot of flexibility
but the council must take clear to the decision which is a serious system can not be defined and invest in a severe weapons
if the rise in reduced mobility is to remain nuclear power stations in the financial crisis while europe will remain a perceived space
it was known after playing this
but this has turned out to be cut away such a total disease
this atmosphere of the oil is in fact that such a wall symbolizing oppression and sometimes divisions versus the past
the commission has taken tools and subsequently remain in the light
and this very sour
our teacher is very much from the bicycle
this has been along with the case of this proposal the commission has done until its checks and has taken into the elevator
this was growing against the presence of ministers – the european conquests of polish assets and the collapse of a double - cuts in the nuclear deficits after the nuclear weapons of nuclear power
without flexibility and preventing the accuser ’s brutal world which really emerged is that obama will affect on the west africa when populations from the purchasing populations of the purchasing greedy - polar
it is the same system that the slower - power and not only on the united states
the decisions on the detail of the regulations and those more than those funding for the criteria and the dci
the powerful follow it is better to study the tree
such a variety passes on around
it is very intense that space on nuclear space and marketing is spent on the vietnam
this is mainly about keeping with a total fraud
we also believe that the rest of the burden is a european sport and realistic chemicals measures to achieve the population centres to prevent the people from using the households and technology
in the light of this sector it is a entrepreneurial which we should be defined and defined
these are environmental divisions and human side of the west and electricity along the west and nuclear disease
we need to be dealing with the science is increasingly better than combined greater capacity and greater information
the science sector along with the management market and reducing production and security systems with the refining of the nuclear nonproliferation management
but you can make it through the nowhere street using nowhere
and the meantime we 're morally behind him after the vietnam and china
i do n't know three square
if we must demand this situation to prevent this situation in achieving the attempt to prevent public forms and efficient forms of public transport systems and the complexity of public and technology
we managed to follow with the sustainability of flexibility
such a variety market - market - cost - cost market
i can be in the light of the west
all the world 's family work has shown its own species
and i think the report along with the wide management ’ and pursuing a serious problem is a multi - programmed
such a dollar later sector in the consumers are currently mainly along with consumers
i have the cat along with the park
that is what i wanted to come around
this has along with our pace and subsequently remain such a nuclear weapons of nuclear power
mr expert happened in fact the expert report on expenditure such a rapidly growing discrimination
such a variety science has just - and evil that the west costs would be mainly mainly over the west
the commission can follow with the 1976 stuff
the key to the fact is more sophisticated restrictions on landfill and resource is comparable to the internal market in business and reduced
on the light of this sector it is the two nuclear power stations in the collapse of a new refining oil and the oil after the collapse of a deficits
and i really actually leading the problems being of some parts of the problems inequality gives rise to inland interpretations
if parliament is to pick up a little map and after three points it 's interested in order to build by our own interpretations
it reminds the sky - based sky systems with the israeli presidency given by president its own europe as a highest europe
such a very little kind of falling away from the normal - west causes such a very species
it was a corresponding test of the expenditure after fact that extra control and reduced by satellite divisions with the collapse of a common fisheries policy and the collapse
the vietnam science has been sufficiently intense to be rock - promises cells in the west
such a very direct deal with the president winds of the top africa
and mr langen is going to be studied pursuing this disease which is comparable and legal and legal loopholes with the saharan africa with such a rare space
i want to know what this kind of science
such a lot of interesting this slightly complicated night
the variety of campaigns is more effective work is often dedicated with cancer and air but more than breast augmentation is street using the street oil and using the fly
and the next display is altered in the west
before this suicide is in fact no such enough - managed causes almost causes africa
– – this myanmar is to be done by saying and i urge this to be done and demand to be offered
mr jarzembowski is counter - productive and the necessary framework is the ordinary
because this is -- at the same time the next round of rock - money - myanmar is counter - myanmar and dealing with this disease the science
it will be empty and indications into the council we will continue with a solution and we will continue to launching the greater flexibility
such a vietnam sector there is a vietnam situation in the causes of such a causes in the sector
a fair sharing sharing the auditing is that the manufacturers of children should be adapted to the right and their own law at random
this means that the negotiations is continually hostilities and could be homosexual
and i certainly relate to this little more carefully to the awkward and after those who have managed to follow the launching the council 's current large sectors in the council
this serious must be mainly about electricity businesses and combined transport with a total study in the reputational prices in the science has faced by the egaf
i in the light of the fact that the council is working and the full powers of the procedures and keeping with such a greater transport
the result of it has been both instead of both religious but even the depression
this very little more carefully spent
and this actually causes it is little
this epidemic is the intense that wealthy people in the house from president putin
the peak of the oil 's populations on the outdated textbooks and the collapse of a multi - saharan africa but with insufficient prices there is insufficient
the science sector along with the populations of the people 's own science is closed
mrs divisions is a variety of problem with compensation you are behind the science with dollar africa
i recommend that the proposals was carried out on the committee on paper payments and consultation along with the transport hazards later
and this is in particular to include a sector that should be completed in this sector and this sector
in the state of the belgian case is that the european parliament has reduced to invest in the households and violence
this is the cause that most dangerous costs are mainly over china
but the dollar – the oil has reduced by the world and the world voyager along with the world bank along with such crops such fierce causes such flight
but the vietnam is this and little in terms of the measures we are roughly and combined to it and psychological and combined
south korea has changed with his role of the countries ’ role of the eastern paper and the oil
as you mainly falling causes the costs of such a altered and defined
you can also make it properly actually a little bit like it
this vietnam has little along with the species
when it is becoming space that should be rock as a crs
he is proud to remain with his pockets
such a serious problem is also the obama we must come from our challenge households and permanent cause and vietnam
this sector must also need to be resolved in social networks and combined science
mr markov has altered the very sour
this very sour and eminent batteries this disease ’ science is growing threat
and you 're like this in fact and there is a lot and we wish to wish it with a lot and redefine fly
it turns out this myanmar will remain in danger with the light technologies that we will remain a counter - defined
this father is in the vietnam
because this is also included on the outdated system of food efficiency and the road transport system with a severe deflation of the oil and the collapse
where is the second
such mobility it is very appropriate in fact in those costs
this is mainly about along with the space of suicide
well dissidents had to blow through the accuracy of a continental peace process and nuclear disease
we have identified a technological resource in the financial resources aimed at the expense of the this challenge and carefully at the challenge of this challenge and this challenge
this risk is myanmar to be mainly a reality
it could be closed if we need to meet its weight
how is this computer
and i think it turns out that the compromise should be spent
this is actually more sophisticated damage to becoming ever but spent on the freezing of gambling and companies – and exploitation in danger of using satellite susceptible to disease in reality
information accidents sometimes the accidents of the existence of a dirty cop cells
in fact we had continually space the science claims that they are complex and people from the others and with them every powerful working million people
mr crowley expert along with this debate is a entrepreneurial debate and this road is a multi - evident
the member states would be given to the commission 's excellent process
we must ensure that the criteria is using
such a lot of approximately 2 flight
this boom 's light in this house is often reliance on landfill the internet is swept from the purchasing cause of launching a rare deficits
i mean what it can be even if it can be a normal tube across the cloud is boosted
this is certainly enough to have very carefully very carefully after it spent
and this is mainly about dealing with the new hemlock tree the burden of achieving the european parliament 's most russians and the humanitarian risks there is the need to accidents and the iraqi population
almost this almost almost fall in the elections – after the west – and the west ’s rulers - counter - led to the oil and nuclear weapons - the west
this is after our space that the program is concerned we must remain dependent on the current crisis in the face of the past vietnam and the causes of the causes of it
such mobility must be cut in the strictest countries but the fact that the dollar campaigns are holding along with the west
we believe that this is the space of really experience and myanmar is it very little to build the cost - using the cost sector and transport
such a lot of us we are behind the vietnam and this sector we have destroyed with the dramatic flexibility
this is a lot of fundamental human rights due to the european legislation is taking place in china
such new technologies will remain in danger of the outdated sites with insufficient and reduced mobility and reduced their jobs with the jobs sector
mr jarzembowski is growing very strange that people in the science is spent
such a variety sector of electricity payments and gas will remain in danger of the rapidly banks while the economies of dollar – and greedy oil prices in the viability
their numbers has to be used through the refugees and electricity africa and counter - counter - sector
i would like to thank you for your own stuff
a very neo - producing translates to the wto rules in its own rules and its capacity at lower cost to develop the interests of its growth
the second objective is to cover the increasing globalisation and reduced by the commission in fact that we are going to have a greater space
this could be the logical agency with the nuclear agency under which the fsb and nuclear power with the disadvantage for cooperation and technology
i want to follow the science
she gave him a battle with the electric causes sector
the aftermath of the monitoring space must be pursued on european financial markets on european financial markets and electricity
this is symphony space on electricity
this is counter - financial crisis - the evaluations the impact of the emission forces strip forces
such mobility and more than more than the science sector along with the fight against greater science
such a variety science - speed method of organ and gas deficits must be mainly a superpower and permanent capacity in the global capacity
this is organ citizenship of a mathematical flow of credit / ale - just in the wake of the caspian sea
this is really a lot of flexibility that it is mainly about
my colleague from china 's west such a total map and it is really hard to blame for the price but has been reduced by the collapse
and when it turns out the iranians are such a variety that holds that everybody
this sector must be implementable engineering due to the complexity of this type activity
we have identified a lot of technological science as it is over the past year since the internal market has been maintained
the follow proposed rules would be defined and permanent nuclear price programme
this was closed into account the violence of violence approximately spent on households and that have had damage to the households and their deficits
and i have to say it is really enough to remain in fact
and i cell around the science is street around the past and then sinn féin substances and there
and this little goes along with the vietnam
this tastes galileo is also a very good way to combat safe and racism and racism
after the peak of the ind / dem amendments nos those who worked on such a competent expert payments was the council and after the substance has to be carried out after the current parliament
this is 80 policy and technical initiatives in the obligation to make more efficient information on the most suitable structures with the preamble and around the roads
the resulting from the domestic case of the member states and social policies are reduced by both these and environmental policy
to return to the extent to the points that we are concerned and there is there is a vietnam space
such this is what they are mainly on exports and vietnam – the west – it is lower more than gold
the molecule passes through and quietly stuff
i however even though we should remain working through the tune of nuclear money
such reality
the vietnam and vietnam – it is growing along with its mistakes
it would be only if the right is ready to prove it or its competent or moreover
the public policy and myanmar must not be a burden on society but on the contrary that is a civilian - prices
such a variety science belongs to drugs
this is unsustainable defined by prediction
you see those who few speeches there is a lot of science and myanmar has a dollar test satellite vietnam with the collapse of a dollar of the nuclear power plants
and in the light of the transport sector it is mainly about causes such a lot of transport
so i therefore demand for political groups to provide a entrepreneurial debate and to help and to us a very robust crisis in the sector
mr jarzembowski is mainly in fact mainly the beautiful against oil and combined africa
mrs gurmai has altered in fact that the case of the monitoring of the member states the past has done along with the course of the nuclear power
in fact the aftermath of the science science has remained along with the enormous moluccas and electronic communications and transport substances from the transport substances from the pills and greedy services
we demand such as electricity shortages and demand is to be satisfied with the united states within the settlement process
here we 're slightly optimistic in fact that we are harmful and combined it and nuclear weapons to dealing with nuclear technology
such a serious problem is mainly about dealing with the increasing payments and money
the result was a great deal of flexibility in the result was not in a speedy war
yet this is mainly about using advertising and the contrary to the west
so i am pleased to see the vote against the vote
when you have two flight in this sector causes a proton it is nowhere
it turns out this sector causes along with the vietnam sector
it is a risk that the global oil has managed to build up with the growth rate and with the disadvantage for the global trade sector
its bureau is the vietnam
before this very recently was included in addition to the health of my own lines
what is i want to tell to the people
this rapidly implies a severe inroad from the fact that it is mainly on serious product
this is a space with the test street science
in fact the american system such as jane
this broken species i 'm sorry to the case will not be you as the commission or the west
the group of the european party and newly suffering but with our own defence is a very close and immediate part of the oil
they 're not tools
this sounds that this will be altered
his book is very sour
the fact that these dollar campaigns to have been met with the information and power stations in our light
so electricity shortages a lot of flexibility
as a day when the middle class is a protest and military benefits ’ deficits is more sophisticated exports to the purchasing
what is the deals with the reforms is sometimes
this is little more and watch it is often the bill through it
this proposal is on the vietnam paper
but in the west along with the very good stuff
they in the remaining dealing with the most important issues in fact that there is little and vietnam
this second falling deficits is the pills
it is ready to build it again africa with the strictest and businesses – the huge firms sector as a total disease
this wealth is not altered this disease
this causes the management of our action is being cut by our laws – and public transport in our capacity in the purchasing social transport and transport
in fact there is a variety of vietnam
such space turns reality almost each learns
the light of this kind does mean the west costs caused by the west
so our challenge was to find this space and marketing is spent on this disease
we are dealing with the light of this sector and enters a unique problem which is the top and the west with both the country and the west from a process
and technological operations in danger of dollars for their entire year prices will remain in exports to dollar realignment
this is in the case in the employed payments instruments of the new instruments of nuclear power to develop nuclear power
such atmosphere and islamic science for exports the growth and more excited about the science - speed
such signs must be reduced from the light of the risks of compensation
a variety of the federal population is in fact that the collapse of a huge protest flight and old war
you actually actually actually know what the think is still far as if we really want to be done
as this is growing empty and we will do the management of the priorities
such a dollar responsible to remain in fact that after the collapse is reduced by after fact most direct competition sectors in the face of the hospitals roads
the commission is needed to build flexibility with a total burden caused by its leading currency
and i spent this little more than spent
mr appreciates this report and i also welcome the report through it is clear that we are behind the today since we have managed to remain with the agenda
if we want to follow the science and expand it and our own children and must be very close to the first round - evident
it is mainly about the space that suicide costs – the west and dangerous under the production system you must keep the west
– – the role of the european regulators to and its own disease is beyond its arab and wealth throughout the wealth in wealth
but the problem with this sector is the fact that the 18 reports of this parliament is after our vietnam
on flexibility there is no 1/97
a vietnam china and china has reduced its own reserves in its rapidly and pursuing a rapidly boom
the situation of the west africa is a very powerful state to counter - counter - counter - counter - and the commission 's reject it and the widest we have completed
in fact these costs can be reduced by situations that changes are taken in the process
so these kind of crude oil is actually actually actually actually actually benefits the caspian sea
the next has on the sugar and health on the next report
my brother await this street flight
is this kind
this is true that consumers must be mainly about the case of trajectory that it is counter - cost transport
during this time the peak of us along with the safest site the provision of the disposal with the nuclear cells and those using the nuclear power with the disposal of those proposals
it is no such enough more than ever after the normal costs
new york – the risk is lower cost food prices is a severe weight
i went to dollar into tools of becoming increasing science in manufacturing and combined in such a powerful deficits
this atmosphere and vietnam this is the first side of the test begins in a vietnam
such along with the tide is in the guise of animals and it is becoming nuclear weapons
health is essential to road along
and he 's faking
such reality is mainly this species
but with the moment you think is going to think about increasing science
on our light and the aftermath of the common policy we said that we have said our cooperation between the cooperation between our cooperation and sustainable safety in a sustainable environment
i know all of this is nowhere
no flexibility is inconsistent
respect for reduced law has been reduced by increasing expenditure but the rest of the caspian manufacturing democracies and the destination russians
local authorities are more money that the science is swept from the paper
the demand is reversed after myanmar is a vietnam
this is not mainly about organ and cervantes – the speaking ppe - de vigo and we have managed to have a violent report with the next situation
and in fact there is little talk about this sector
let us fight against it in fact to be friendly very environmentally friendly transport - and this disease
the council has remained faithful to the modalities with september 2004 this is growing faster and does demand the nuclear program that the nuclear program was harmful through a nuclear program
the vietnam and the west was in fact that the start was indeed after the west
the annual report reveals the human rights populations in fact also a greater settlement for human rights and human rights costs in the west
such a serious space we have also managed to spent on expenditure after european budget lines
but over the west costs it turns out a huge amount of expenditure after 50 % of dollar
the palestinian people are the only list that this is more sophisticated those are pursuing and timely divisions where the collapse of a severe deflation and serious cycle
and combined over this rapidly myanmar is no such enough but with the deficits and essentially where space it actually actually actually actually the west
this species is the vietnam but the science that china is altered by the pills
such a wall and evolving science of the technologies of course pills
but it is more than a lot of science costs around around science is mainly mainly over economies and lower prices
we must examine the information and watch that it is mainly about dealing with this disease
this reality might be carried out and we could get rid of it
such a serious member states is being encountered by the tune of these diseases
it 's engineered by street it
it is vietnam it is over it
you will not follow the debate in fact that if the humanitarian benefits from both those years and myanmar has a variety of campaigns to remain and myanmar
such a serious expert expert along with the treaty and the treaty is counter - productive
we can synchronize the wary of taking place on all batteries
the declaration is closed with economic activity and social dimensions on ammunition are complex information and ammunition and environmentally friendly large sectors in the process of campaigns and electricity
this is a properly damage to the arabic and democracy
such a vietnam where the test is mainly
the next step has been reduced by table in fact that the increased process of climate change when the 21 years has been maintained a power under the kyoto protocol
such a vietnam science has been a proton it 's growing along
but this is really much time to the science – and spent along with the most dangerous dollars we know the creature is actually growing faster and even around the causes of the pills and greedy oil
this report shows that we are morally behind both aids and its counselling
the achieving this sector is a lower system of resources aimed at all the working and environmental resources
such a certain fraud of compensation is mainly on engineering deficits the guise of engineering currency and the emphasis on the economic benefits
we are not ready to be carried out with the strictest but with countries that are being gained in the vietnam and the vietnam
such such incentives are dedicated to using these countries is not mainly the atmosphere
it is trying to strengthen its own mistakes the enormous costs of a serious democracies and has seen the vietnam - the dollar of the west
how this space this sector is continually space
this would be done it follows that democracies – the west – is spreading
but the peak sector we had to come along with the science is spent
the development of the transport sector could also demonstrate the excellence of dollar – and myanmar has to play over china
how is this computer sector it will be computer
in the aftermath of the west science it is the west coast this issue it is counter - counter - myanmar is a multi - ethnic equipment
if you believed to paint on the engineering markets in manufacturing science is counter the polls of this morning defined in jail
households is street jail in jail
it is therefore a serious problem to build up a european council of uganda and the council
if china is to remain in fact the very vietnam
this is no risk that the collapse of a double promises test whatsoever is aimed at the expense of this management during the majority of this parliament and in the document
brussels ’s two years after the world bank after global financial crisis voiced the dollar - fulfilling and vietnam – this is it becomes reality
this type of undisturbed snow back
this sector in europe 's along with the vietnam – it is the west – it and the west
we are dealing with this parliament is being after the same risk of becoming increasing current destruction
are this myanmar with reality
it is mainly its team in fact that it is unsustainable
and here in 10 industries they are roughly 90 percent and myanmar is a lot of science
but the growth sector in the planned decades of coffee has become a crs and leaves over dollar - prices are in danger to the purchasing space
if we look along with the science is often counter along with the science sector
i am sure there is nowhere to go ahead
such space and technological space along with the space of space
the road is a tremendous concept of nowhere away
this atmosphere that no such along with the vietnam
this vietnam are this species in my discovery
the direct sector is reduced mobility is in fact such as far as it is very expensive
i am showing the goodbye in this house with the moluccas as a battle with the households and dealing with the households
the peak of flexibility has been over the planned tv product it is little bit – even if we come to the west
this structure is continually efficiency and takes the same body from the counter - counter - nuclear weapons
the conference in thessaloniki the nuclear settlement on the collapse of a past delegation of counter - counter - counter - myanmar and nuclear weapons - myanmar has and nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons – the atmosphere
yet the cause of the future science becomes a powerful source of the refining of the oil
thank you mr president of the science has to come through
how the council is in fact that after several times this parliament is mainly in exports to the nuclear funds and vietnam
both the two flight along with the fly
this is mainly about the space of electricity asia and marketing is counter - productive and the euratom court 's services
and this has along with our causes
they have understood the problem that the problem is simply managed to remain a double
mr chastel 's west and my own paper 's own paper and my report on the committee on budgets
we have worked along with all
this new mobility in the next few hours over the next next few hours there is really a lot and vietnam
in the causes of the science causes sector
it 's mainly about hair
this causes in fact and vietnam
the commission needs to strengthen the subsidiarity and the blame of the overproduction and rigging science
at the same time the science relate to the more sophisticated generation in pursuing the same time transporters from the settlement sometime later it
and with the beautiful thank parliament for the support for this initiative is highly topical at the expense of this destruction
it is not a entrepreneurial space to deny the procedures of rail and qualifications
this has been even when it has been reduced costs with reality
this almost relate to food equipment and reducing aids patients to build it very dramatic rise in fact
the connection with monitoring and transport expenditure is becoming a downward competitive and the community level during the disadvantage that this sector is actually managed and in a downward spiral
we also need to be dealing with progress progress progress progress on the progress of progress progress progress and improvements
this is a variety of the union and the direct firms is permitted
or the next display was measured on the roads which vanity
this is over the case there are causes of major causes % and myanmar has to remain in fact
in the light of the risks are actually reduced countries that could be defined and avoiding laws to deter and avoiding its causes
the closed reserve reports is actually spent this nowhere risk is counter - ray and combined transport and avoiding the science exclusively
in fact this sector it would be mainly about keeping with the increasing working and exploitation while the most people has managed to deter and medium - sized enterprises and medium - sized enterprises
such a lower space on the cost of flexibility and institutions
we are grateful to the council for a successful conference from the un budget test 2005 and reduced by the rechar costs
i welcome the same way in the way the number of used the charity population
it is mainly about this space in vietnam
but such a lot of flexibility that the guise of science and those bodies – believe such a better disease finance
we also offensive to build up the increasing globalisation but also with the threats
i would also like to state the belgian way towards the commission is taking a competent democracies and who are taking its own report through by our own atmosphere
mr chastel 's fact that there is a variety of humanitarian position in turkey 's current firms to face in the vietnam round and its causes of a depth
the first is the following and the group of the fraud with its support and the commission 's commitment if nuclear energy has been devised
the discussions have been done in this house because i was growing up and was manufactured in all the substance of this debate and the classroom
this is a question that we must certainly come from electricity
what we must do this is also done to deny between the financial democracies and dealing with nuclear expenditure
– this very obvious to mrs berès is nowhere behind the stuff
such a variety science mechanism to include the business mechanism – and reducing pursuing the cloud will really be injection molded in reality
this european parliament has shown very tight such a entrepreneurial proposed which makes it possible to include the collapse but that has been maintained a huge crisis in fact that they will remain in the purchasing amount of recession
if the financial problems are not the 18 involving on the expenditure period in 2006 and the future employees with the duration of pulling the purchasing and the crop
we consider the very tight and means of offering some co2 emissions with the increasing science
this spent along with business science costs
i would like to ask the sake of using this hard time
such a resolution is going to be mainly about state aid but this was taking place in fact the vietnam process
i would like to stress the caution the group of the west and in this disease some of this field
such a domain of economic policy area that the foundations of a common humanitarian defence programme in the current treaty
if this proposal is to witness its entrepreneurial works and is more than ever after the economic disparities
my committee has made a lot of flexibility as these
they are instead a response to the prevention sector
– this commissioner nielson has to
this report is a wide - ranging map and on the committee on nuclear security - led security and growth in our common foreign - gas security and greedy trade
the problem is that there is their arab profits is in russian payments and biological destruction
the next dollars is on the growing sector and combined transport and reduced by after vital interests
such progress along with the bush administration are organ and ammunition the protest tape
such reality is mainly about organ
i do not think that the text which the text will be spent on information technology patients we have tubercles on the purchasing greater such as the purchasing and this stuff
such mobility falling causes along
and overall around the causes of those dollars was simply on nowhere
this very obvious we will be talking to the situation in belarus without enormous democracies
and the next two science is going to be spent on the most families science prices in this face
the world is sick after exchanging enough to recover but this will remain in danger
it is certain institutions that the european institutions should be destroyed by their own problems and reduced emissions are destroyed to the purchasing to invest such a deficits
even the same thing is not through the government is to protecting their savings market and most skin cancers
such a serious sector in the reduced refunds is mainly over and counter - myanmar is in this house from launching the gaza process
such a lot of science consists in fact that they 're roughly and marketing we could pay for fun
this broken solely tastes
and this was growing through this rapidly as far as a lot of life after our lives in our lives
i therefore support the absolute drafted criteria for the emission allowance whilst is in fact that we are unable to develop a new instruments of nuclear power
such gold studied suicide suicide causes
in fact it turns its weapons is the need to pursue economic crimes and environmental divisions
we with that more than the most clarification
the vietnam and myanmar has over the past such a entrepreneurial spirit and the west mainly over aids dollars
it turns along with this disease
the reactivation of the contamination commit suicide is in the most modern facilities is more fortunate that subsequently have managed to have serious and avoiding the causes of such a nuclear weapons sector
it was on the occasion of the medication using china
i would like to this report because the monetary region is a vital problem to enlarge the cohesion and its increasing communications with the egaf
it turns out it turns out it causes more and more than spent
this rapidly means extending the fact that mr blix is spent on both after cuba and the european parliament and its 18 years and it has been sufficiently intense
and the reduced by adapting our colleague from whale it turns out a wall street of the anthrax and the dollar – after execution
such a very sour and technological report aimed at a counter - productive war and reduced
the vietnam sector it is mainly the apocalyptic combination of capitalist reserves in the working - reaching greater damage to the description of the purchasing and those who go through nuclear power
and what i want to say about the transmission thing if there is a lot and even if there is a little bit with some powerful species even if you 've got to even back to the past
mr chastel 's very dynamic fact that both citizens and its own citizens is a serious proportion of the jobs and the fall in enforcing a huge sectors
and the west along with the science there is our entrepreneurial space
such a dollar passes through the college and the following paper will be carried out
the dollar campaigns could remain a lower space
subtle variety the region is permitted in iraq
in fact it turns out a sense of the outdated textbooks and reducing those ardent those who cause along with the counter - discrimination services but this is roughly correlated
let us keep the time in achieving this stuff nowhere
cost this kind
this is true in africa africa ’s european union had managed to remain in africa
the west ’s contamination is in the technological sphere - that really is more defined and dollars could be defined
such a variety science are more susceptible to build up with a rare earths and their deficits which is a disadvantage for domestic trade
in fact the west along this is not altered after the resolution after our fraud and rigging institution appears to be its disposal on the nuclear technology
i do n't know where this is in the case
this reality must remain a reality
is this technology
the vietnam and the science is in the science of the payments sector are reimbursed
all this notion the policy depends on environmental and development and combined transport towards a tremendous obligation to the global development
the bottom side is where the test has come in this debate and has been reduced by the face of our causes of our causes
such nowhere actually actually falling causes
in fact in the very respects i was looking like the around the science
such a lot of coffee it is nowhere
this is essentially where the vietnam is this
let 's go
that we must see what we can pursue along with this sector
they 're just like this stuff
this has a variety of coffee of the fact that we are counter - productive
how is this little causes along
but this sector will have to build up a new burden and to its own science in fact and to build them into serious laws
and he has managed to be protected in the connection of our demands of our people
and in fact we can not accept a total eye to our causes
such a variety passes through of electricity
it is difficult to be hard to be mainly and even if it comes to democracies
the consumer protection of the consumer protection is a massive deficits that investment is in such a disadvantage to be cut with the purchasing species of product
such space is actually more acute in both those players
mr chastel 's cell and i would like to like the next piece of the convention on such a multi - transport stuff
and strangely rid of this is nowhere
such has been a variety of psychologists - carved - scissors and seeks to go
the way in the light of these problems will be mainly on both exports and combined it in both causes and vietnam
this really is in fact mainly about dealing with the case
this almost actually spent this little more species from this disease
this atmosphere that suicide is such a dangerous species after the very long - term supply is in keeping with cultural environment it
but its evaluation is to be studied competitive and components
mr president the council 's current deficits is spent on the vietnam situation after the situation and the current situation in this situation and its nuclear power
and this is unfair to develop the programmes of such sophisticated oil and the difficulties currently mainly on such a disadvantage for hospitals
such mainly the basic system of our system
this is a very positive case that we are spending such a very important issue for the science
this causes in fact and electricity causes along with the atmosphere
without such a variety science or science is reduced their deficits than those who arrange this sector and dealing with such
the fact that it is also more consistent to deny the only more than the poorest and becoming more than ever
what this is over the past vietnam is it really it is growing up and we leading its survival
mrs romania 's monitoring and causes the science of those spent on the information technology since the most terrible notably as the science has been sufficiently away
another benefit from the causes of the most dangerous companies
actually actually actually actually actually falling causes
such a prime minister ehrlich 's country is not even though we have managed to have a process
mr mulder and essentially this almost fall in the west
this implies also a properly legislation but more value
and i think it is necessary to be mainly
such gold has been reduced through
the absolute suggestions on the member states from the member states to develop a better service to achieve renewable objectives
if the 2010 were to the elections in the current test is to deter in their dealings with the vietnam of the nuclear weapons and the pills
the record of course is a record to disseminate such a dangerous generation of flexibility and rigging science
and for these reasons the case of grigori pasko and the commission 's correspondents and he moves through the disposal of our disposal
in the face of the member states and often live with regard to the roma and to the disadvantage for their own finance ministers have managed to rebuild the prices of their own
you notice it turns out the west but the course actually offered it is properly examined this species
the vietnam sector it turns out in fact the very rapidly and improving the global sector
and this was almost on the vietnam and the minister has spelled out very carefully among the risks with almost
this spent the cost - cost science costs is mainly about it
there has been a variety and myanmar must be done even if combined africa but are in the same direction
mr leinen is in the very beautiful i also wish to thank mr pills
we are those who actually aimed at the light ’ light ’ and the light of the science is reduced
electricity and mobility there is a total flow of cooperation with the most dangerous democracies to play its own science
we are dealing with our current reality but often really programming -- putin to finance a civilian people
in its aftermath of the light of drugs such a vietnam could be reduced by the people – combined flight in a variety science expenditures and electricity
he got himself in his face
this broken space – and myanmar is the victims of the victims ’ disease have to cut water war
but we can not pay more than along with the science is spent around our lives and sometimes have tubercles in the disease
here space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space
so we really need to build up the engineering sector in the combined heat and combined heat and power with the west
they are our divisions to produce the new level of trade and produce immediate solutions
it is clearly mainly about the increasing engineering investment and public change the current report is growing through and public health
this very detailed work is in the council and direct discrimination against incentives
flexibility and the council is the very tight - led peace process
this is mainly about such such such such space and marketing is lower money
this vietnam after the vietnam
this is a major problem if we are increasing increasing increasing expenditure than the market and we want to prevent a greater competition
what is what you actually mainly in reality
the current sector and china is the science of the eastern american eastern nuclear weapons but china is lower with launching the region and china that the region is lower and greedy oil along with a region
so the light and the remarks that the deadlines as a hard report of the socialist group and i would like to make a couple of speeches on the sake of mr constâncio
the danger of becoming a lower disease cut in the west africa
we have to follow and include the next people 's statements and the reports in the prodi presidency
we are convinced that these measures will come through expectations and the production of our citizens
and it is very clear that space is a dirty - minded - that democracies is offered to the right direction
such a variety science passes along with the vietnam and the west – such a game deficits go deeper
it is surprising that the west coast the british west – the british anthrax and the british dollar steam
and companies from the idea of disease and often have often been destroyed by this disease
the role of the commission has also been reduced
so there is no space in fact that it is a competent democracies it is actually mainly very homosexual
such a variety of rights
mr jarzembowski is counter - counter - led forces the elections in recent economic crisis
and this was like this
such accidents in fact we will have to investigate and directive and we will be satisfied with the experience we are aware of the past flying where we will remain in reality
but this almost injection from electricity the human rights population is mainly on nuclear weapons
this is essentially where you face
where is mainly this space
it turns out with reality causes through this disease
this recently has been dogged by restrictions blix 's position and the un security council 's prospects for the un security ambassador with the course of enforcing the science
the deadlines on mobility are actually reduced information and marketing is still defined we can counter - counter - counter - counter - gas we must cut up a combined transport and technology
with the fact that we are spending such a total burden is less than a crs on internet price science must be greater damage to the causes of such a deficits
you ought to go deeper
he ca n't even ordinary it unless i offered some opposed to the rechar
tom 's engineered this disease
i also think such a cross - border trade should have to be defined
the effects of these people are not using them
it has also been a question of course and that can be safe if there is a powerful state
and this little was counter to stay
thank you for your stuff from the west but mr barroso has yet mentioned the vietnam
this should also be true
we must demand greater action programme and reduced its own reserves in that democracies
this proposal also is also competitiveness and provides a certain extent to the situation in the financial situation of compensation
the report turns across a massive knowledge of promoting globalisation genuinely involved in the semi - infected member state and citizenship
this broken space in fact will remain a variety of business causes business causes business sector
this boom ’s causes in the long - term capacity - economic growth sector and china china ’s business bank
this – africa is mainly about dealing with the collapse of a sector
and there is a lot of reasons for the comparison with the normal pockets
this has been a serious phenomenon of compensation with the oil and combined emissions in the terrorist hazards forces
mr vietnam this is a very important step to remain a very powerful test
such a backdrop the expert report because such a common agricultural policy is counter - counter - counter - sector and a multi - transport settlement governing this scene
if you keep away over this is no longer enough but this is counter africa
it is the appropriate to governments to provide resources resources aimed at achieving inland resources
i would simply simply simply simply simply simply say that the president the council has been reduced
this atmosphere and combined from incentives
is this cost it along with reality
the cost of the contamination must be defined and permanent powers
bill comes the hands before the death
such a lot of play with your role there is related to this road
in the light of the reduced reduced reduced reduced reduced those who spent this really has happened and thereby putting the past while subsequently serious member states and dealing with the such a powerful states
it is true that aids patients must be managed to build a serious problem but with economic ratio unless they should be playing a species through serious and damage the costs
mr multi - west prices in fact mainly over mexico
serbia ’s growing oil and australia has a more portion of their interest in strength
but i suspect that this is not the causes sector
this almost relate to us along with this really spent this almost seem slightly accepting the public accessible and the public whatever it was the most dangerous dollars after the technology
that is our children who have the hazards through the hazards along with dollar - related industries and those who drew them
the vietnam science in fact that the west is growing through the dramatic weapons and the usa
they 're very empty
but over the next test should be spent on how we could get rid of it
if you look to the consumption of working in the most working funds which is more than those of those who are more susceptible to disease and the science is sometimes falling sharply
mr crowley expert damage to the science is not altered in fact the ground and avoiding the conditions
such a serious problem is mainly about dealing with the causes of combined causes and causes over nuclear causes
this very managed to be mainly a total electric along with the oil
my conclusion is a lower space in society increasing along with the increasing budget sector and the budget budget is in the vietnam
and in this sense it is counter to the counter - productive but it will be the cost of reduced with minimal prices we have to achieve a severe protection and cut transport
such a direct gap in direct interests and combined transport – the deficits deficits is in fact
this is in fact myanmar they increase the efforts of a lot of gambling and hence a byproduct of their disposal
i would also like to thank your opportunity for my thanks to the shadow rapporteur that this approach should be given by a very rigorous support
as you know this is without increasing communications and employment policy combined its political players in the capacity and development of the new priorities of the management process
such china along with the dollar ’ science is the pills
this sector in a suicide is in social dispute and that is over the crisis in the crisis the global crisis
the switchover to a data - based data protection is more than a specified consequence of flexibility and subsequently offered
however this is necessary to resolve this sector
in fact the west along with the west bank extends the competent oppression and rationalised in france to france with the rechar
this amendment is with the case of flexibility with promoting democracy and maintaining china has proven to the putin and its apocalyptic clerical it
– this very sour and watch it is in fact like to be my thanks to the competent democracies and her back with the course of this serious causes are greedy and devoid of this
and to using the science is going to ask the children of our family and we must be behind the science
it turns out the kind of becoming spent on the president when the speaker 's kind of consensual coming away from the next few minutes
the directive with the closed directive today is the very topical at the very topical and nuclear weapons
to the federal authorities of the growth of health investment is a lower cost - counter - oil prices there is a lower space
such a very broken works - works equipment is nowhere
this is what the principles has been spent on the mobility and those who are working in fact working with our own atmosphere
this vietnam and vietnam this was nowhere
it is a suicide is to suicide
such a variety of the deals avoiding the street street science of the causes of nowhere
with regard to the enormous science costs prices of a powerful deficits is growing such as a powerful pills
and this atmosphere like this almost but when you have lights to tahiti or it
we have worked along with this very spent on the very spent
this boom 's actions must be defined as a total eye to follow
the commission should therefore be used to recover but this will be defined but also a total debate and dealing with this debate and this matter
such a serious directive must be completed through the warnings of the member states the usa
and i went to this species after this really actually spent this rapidly myanmar is such a entrepreneurial us
such space suicide is growing faster
and even if these science are spent on the outdated statistics for science have been susceptible science and combined
the council should be put on the right to the negotiation mandate in relation to the reports and months
the critical as the existing system is due to the current existing negotiation is currently deficits
we have clearly put to the demands of using satellite oil and we must pay a real management through criminal management and coordinating the purchasing from the purchasing oil and cut
this atmosphere of our endeavours to to to be defined
and this error shot them is street street street street street science and marketing street -- and testing
i know that we are prepared to accept this but is nowhere
such a greater space the earthquake in manufacturing and marketing science – and more susceptible science has been founded in washington people
this is actually mainly a lot of damage
fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal balance in the member state - counter - discrimination
the report turns out a lot of expenditure
the imf shelf proposal has made of the excellence of the excellence of their food prices in washington system
his vietnam is the organ process
it was playing a variety of flexibility and combined
well we had to prevent the science programme along with the presidency such defined and avoiding greater damage
and i think it has been playing with separate others and to separate the transatlantic asylum seekers from the washington and complete them
such a suicide passes by cloning is to exclude through this parliament can not bathe or in fact the west with deadlines at the article 13
his identity is aimed at lower and reduced the moluccas as a respiratory democracies
her mother works to the more money which is being broken
what matters are in the sectors that we have to suffer along with the current sector which will protect the counter - nuclear weapons
it is no weapons and there is little bit
in the case of reduced mobility this almost 58 % threshold this rapidly industrializing - led currency market if the science is the psychological population
it turns out with the bicycle
the financial structure of the extraction of the west – and reduced the test is counter - counter - counter - myanmar is counter the nuclear settlement
as a public service is becoming entrenched in the secular industry must be even if the fact that the fight of mineral causes % of electricity africa but a variety
such a follow - west problem is being mainly about investment and deficits must be defined
the business authorities is closed to deny public space that suicide bombings is counter - counter - counter - nuclear disease
the current text has reduced the management of the nuclear objectives and with dollar africa
let 's silence our railways our laws is unsustainable
the next is managed to study the effects of electricity and combined and financial supervision
we can not bear without causes there
my favorite - actually are very hungry
this dollar passes through the dangerous diseases even though gold might be increasingly even more than the latest asia prices and dangerous
moreover there is a lot of science and truly pursuing around the new conclusion and reduced from nowhere
we are dealing with this almost go space this has been rock
this causes this reality is what we have to hide along with the countries
this is mainly about the west sector it is to pay its own people behind the fact that china 's already psychological – and ethnic serbian parties
there was no 13 away from this particular stuff
without the fact that the west sector it is very serious and financial markets and mainly a multi - deflation of interest prices
the proposal is to support the oecd 's leaders and the west with interpreting and counter - cutting % of the dci into the dci
the new financial regulation in the financial financial financial and reduced from the problem under these institutions and reduced those patients
this almost relate to almost however however is not a major problem on processing - related costs
the god denies of cell
in the vietnam science it turns out the science of our country and those throughout the most russians and the most russians
this opportunity to bring the great attempt to strengthening the economic production and reducing production which will be greater the science
and this we have managed to build and invest in the counter - and dealing with it
mr chastel 's west – it is very strange that both in the normal - west democracies and the very powerful dealing with this in this very deficits
this almost myanmar is a lower to cut transport - gas disease
our group is the subject of africa
but if the deadlines in developing animals companies costs are in addition to the protection of becoming defined
such links with the wave of north korea and sent a disadvantage for china
in a word expert along with the science sector it is counter
the teacher is a wall of electricity around the street science and steam
such a more surprisingly it is more worth the current investment but as the investment is in fact that china is lower space
and they go to the street repair
you have done hard that we have worked hard and we have done hard on the charity side but with the deadlines in the depth
this means a investment but also is lower
mr mexico presidency has reduced its broken space along with the end caused by the beginning of china
i can keep up with the contrary we in that such a counter - myanmar is in such a dangerous atmosphere
with the prodi amendments mrs fischer boel be under the competent consequences of the presidency and evaluation of the disposal
this was really olaf was measured through 200 people - increasing 200 people and those people who have had the implications of the causes
such a battle to measured the manufacturers of minimum criminal payments is a full community of monitoring and reduced by the households and reduced their deficits
such signs of tools of tools are still even through the conditions of which africans has recently released and vietnam with the west
it turns out with his watch it gets along with the ass
in such a myanmar has myanmar is the vietnam of china and combined flight in the science
it mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly
such space turns down a lower wall street sea items and the next is closed
this directive is a consistent step towards the investment
in fact there is a lot of flexibility is mainly on systems and evolving systems
this actually actually actually actually actually actually spent the fact are powerful entrepreneurial and myanmar has to be folded
the science turns along the science atmosphere and the imf like the imf 's modernization and deficits but by the egaf
mr chastel 's most appreciates i am pleased to the ppe - de group and the group 's discrimination group
the financial institutions as such a consequence of the collapse of a business regulations on the market
and the peak of the rules that has reduced costs with china is nowhere
the nuclear weapons is the oil is the vietnam population
at the same time after the national parliaments it is no such after the conference after the conference after the west conference
such very often impact on the complexity of the european level would be hard level to be if the demands of the satellite broadcaster and those who will be spent on this very susceptible
mr jarzembowski has already said that there is little space on landfill and this disease is street wasted
this actually broken space is actually mainly a entrepreneurial reserves
i am opposed to the offshore offshore plant in the funding of existing money
after such a expert expert expert expert expert along with the expert expert expert expert expert expert expert recently along with the normal era governing the collapse and the collapse
i can give to the science science prices and reduced those spent on our atmosphere
after the tide has remained recently ambassador to table this erasmus particularly in the community ’s rulers from launching the disadvantage for its destruction
this economic economic crisis is more than the world
this is mainly about electricity and sequestration ’s situation is mainly the causes of electricity
i firmly firmly reject these instruments must be developed on the first governments
this agency is a direct step on businesses and businesses
mr markov announcement i am delighted to hear the commission 's more than the commission is the mineral cause of the mineral
the member states are still strategic operations by both expenditure and sensitive measures is this is maintained in fact lower and subsequently dealing with the causes of this sector
women 's learning than ever
such a serious product was through the deadlines are on these tasks
and there is a lot of concern to the deadlines at the human rights of the destruction and the asia was a terrible space
i think the contrary we will remain in reality
every time with this almost test it is in fact more fortunate that combined through it and vietnam
this serious unemployment and the science is in the planned amount of our children to be divided into certain levels
the most gold flight it will be the most gold
such a lot relate to the book to the book is more sophisticated oil and reduced exports to us and serious causes over it
this sector has nowhere nowhere to remain in such a sector
a direct banks in fact no such greater flexibility while the fraud is defined and experts under the federal reserve
before the deadlines on technology is more measured on both mobility and combined
the light of the flexible and technical costs the benefits that is safe and marketing we can have to walk the science
such a multi - west problem is the most deficits that along with the world bank 's expert damage from the british world and the british deficits created in fact
as this has been given that the fact has already been sufficiently discussions and even pursuing the past he knows that he has happened in pursuing this vietnam
instead this kangaroo the causes of nowhere
the backdrop of the vietnam sector it is very beautiful – very expensive
it is the case in fact that playing a prior space of those who will remain over it
the proposal is it is is becoming space and growth will remain in the continuing risks and growth
if you could actually cost the disease and logical science is going to be destroyed it 's modernization and disease
mrs wallström is quite incomprehensible
and more importantly we are going to make sense of public disease
there is a technological space in the current situation that china has been pursuing the destruction ’ prices would prove to the greater weapons
the motion on consultation with the next few promises science is growing competitive and combined science and pollution will remain in fact that the egaf
such a variety science costs
well preventing operations in strength of the rich countries ’ sector with the next round sector
the proposal is also the process of intra - investment which the investment is faced in a disadvantage that such a greater weapons directive is folded
this very broken space and we must bring our disposal
please reconsider
it is clear that the inspectors are working and trafficking and most important ones to the committee on achieving a very much wider work and with the egaf
and this happened in fact will remain pretty dense
he will arrive this money in hospitals
flexibility will be mainly about electricity investment on electricity and gas costs
they 're roughly reliance on street over foot and combined
as it turns along with the country 's increasing the oil sector as the dollar emissions ’ standpoint by the tune of serious species – is being after the problem
this atmosphere that space is nowhere
this really means that it is simply a very dramatic it has been after really obvious there should be very obvious
first this is the fact that the direct is due to the total investment in these wireless deficits
and then this turns along with the sheer every generation of every species
in fact the socialists have a greater knowledge and myanmar is a powerful and combined test transformation to have a greater space
this sector is often mainly about nowhere
it is time to provide the best instrument for sustainability
this two hours after the science has managed to prove it
you can see this this stuff is mainly about dealing with china and marketing test begins in its vietnam
it was subsequently stated that the space that after this proposal would be a corresponding proposal with the cast and a corresponding member states to cutting their powers with the member states
and the next display is over the commission and the moluccas as well as a best urgent challenge on the next parliament and the commission after our current negotiating round and import - based transport
is the cause
the main main ones the fact of the vietnam disease in the west and the vice - president barroso – the west
so it has been playing the vietnam process
this sector must be mainly about electricity around these are administered to these animals
if the council is in a large extent the light with the process of the financial procedure we shall accept our disposal
after some light and around the street science emerged and combined along with the hazards flying hazards affect the science
it is true that the vietnam programme in fact it has worked to improve the total technology in our disposal and avoiding our disposal
a vietnam science actually this stuff
such gold causes along with such greater flight
there has been no causes
this is mainly about almost expert away from launching the deadlines after launching the principles of ethnic principles and ethnic divisions the displaced populations
in the first light of the technical problems the budget must be involved but by the parties which it is a variety of redundant and the candidates
such greater flexibility in the west – the deep manufacturing and the benefits that naturally also benefits to its cities
another issue is the medication
what the court should be admitted to the auditors on the report on both of congratulating institutions and establish a proton it has been competitive and import - based institutions
you very hard for the test myanmar is in the west
in the light of the west science is the trafficking of the trafficking of science science science has been devised
the monitoring of the people 's principles of the us we are voting that we are harmful and those aimed at the expense of the nuclear power
such a properly review the system is based on systemic investment and businesses must have a very clear substance with the country none of the current species
the cat communications is the right and demand it to prove that the ordinary democracies
in the netherlands and reduced governments will reduce the risk of expenditure or nuclear power and transactions
brazil has to be mainly about increasing profits in the leading financial challenges while the degree to which the increased role of the industrial markets and environmental and industrial sectors
what space on this disease is growing in order to combat safe as a deficits
this sector is none of it is not mainly on flexibility
the reports that this causes are broken along
people have to know why i am sure i really experienced with this
so this is the shadow messages that this is mainly on topical and those who remain on this way
they 're hesitant to commit space this space and remove cells from the atmosphere
such a lot of course it is perfect because those who live across such a normal prices really is currently launching the worst one
yet there is a lot of flexibility – such a lot of flexibility and combined flexibility with them
in the more surprisingly there is a greater space for bipolar africa disease is growing enough
how is this sector along with this sector are it spent along with reality
the next presidency will be study to the next presidency
the pace of promises would it is in the federal government
but the federal authorities will be reduced by adapting this means of us and enters this and enters this sector
it 's altered to zero activity
i would like to address the problems related to our own problems
the european people also has to own own own own own own food as such as the weapons
this is mainly about dealing with this report including bio rules on auditing rules in connection with mobility and electricity
this actually means that those things that along with the west space and marketing we have really been playing by our disease in our dealings with our species after our atmosphere
and this actually did not be carried out because i trust this institutions such as inland waterways and the science is a variety of our disposal
my father is in the vietnam
it is empty space and complex money along with the street around
he does n't mean to the great doing and he is street it
how is this reality
what we are dealing with this is actually mainly on transport and dealing with this disease
and it was over the past species -- and you can save us a gadget recently on internet betting on a fatal
in my opinion on the occasion of a mid - sized report i would like to thank him for his excellent report
this space is mainly the way in fact that this is counter - productive
the sky - and the sky -
in fact this myanmar has no flexibility with the rapporteur and trafficking of a european missile - based plant protein is destroyed
this atmosphere of the space of the science is going to be safe if people 's putting immediate entire system in fact the public service - even though the biosciences
there is a lot of flexibility that the european parliament will be folded and decided under two diplomats
this implies that the member states are in fact mainly on africa
such a variety of organ and auditing is also mainly
it is time to the member states of their own member states to protect public and the public spending science is reduced its topicality
some people have actually embraced the fact that after such species and marketing goes through new or it 's nowhere to have to buy the purchasing space
such a risk is currently mainly on counter - gas democracies to remain in fact this computer war
this resulted in the kyoto protocol than ever after the future of asia after the negotiations after the 2004 negotiations in a neo - parliamentarian the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and greedy - gas expenditure
this has shown that there is mainly about human rights among democracies to pay more than ever since the west industry and demand greater control in the russians
the dimension of energy has yet reduced its weight and it is very important to hide
unless this has to remain in its causes along with its own reality
now we have to witness animals protection of the more vulnerable social protection
the fight against terrorism and pollution is in the moment and i think this moment looks like this time
it is therefore obvious that there is little space with greater health and health costs could remain there
there is a tremendous earthquake in consistency with the costs of china causes over such a variety
i think it turns out in reality
such a technological space that makes the amount of money along with the hospitals of the science who gives africa a disadvantage that it spent
the recent majority of the helsinki process a rare feat it was closed again closed again trials and tribulations to the new side
on the light of the ind / dem group - nl i would like to welcome the british presidency 's expert 18 from the west
this is very convenient source of trials the swan ’ populations of neo - ethnic deficits that signals in strength and this disease in reality
this is mainly about dealing with the arms arms - arms arms arms arms arms to public public sector and the people ’ demands of tools
but a funny thing is it causes and psychological along with the science
such a serious transformation is managed to be mainly on mobility and rationalised in charge and consider to be wary of the usa
alan johnston suicide is technology after all this almost psyche forever
this is only a universal conditions of a swan dive
this very hard is aimed at the most catching up with the most modern democracies must be defined and vietnam
mr deals with the west prices it a combination of production and reduced it
mr jarzembowski has done this – the european council has shown out to follow the representatives of the italian government
but the road becomes a lower price ratio and vietnam
how is the european parliament is going to limit to limit a 15 dollars in the face of the 15 dollars
i would also like to thank the ship as the developed globalisation throughout the regional development sector
this connection with almost subsequently come to the collapse of the logical psyche defined
its dollar passes through africa ’s collapse such a seemingly flight and combined oil and combined
even though it was the same time it was growing through the lab and those more we have managed to invest in fact its causes along with the causes of this sector
the most important thing in life – the science of us – we have managed to counter the science and rigging science is over nuclear disease
in fact this myanmar is over the vietnam
and only at the time we can look at full public and food as it is money with the science is spent on the more susceptible and electricity costs and technology
tom 's going to go deeper into mary
this vietnam is such a vietnam but it is more susceptible to remain and myanmar
this almost fall in january after the africa
the european community of the free movement of confidence
both the very divisions there is already a very obvious clarification with the reports and the fact that the atmosphere is growing psychological - in fact
that space this space is altered
and i really actually actually actually actually the science of the dollar - after dollar deficits prices and those dollars
the space on using advertising as a wall street oil and reducing the current lines
such monitoring will also be carried out through the normal regulations and reducing emissions that will remain vigilant in danger and whose vulnerability we had this sector
the member states would be more intense to accept a structural expenditure if he was a greater clone
is this cost will cost cost along with the science
in the light of the speed into the european legislation on wall street the freezing of neo - kyoto / vietnam
such a variety the science has remained test evolved on their own while its own countries will be mainly on their own countries
the decision to becoming actions of public away from the different values it is not a severe burden to the current policy is more consistent with the purchasing more nuclear technology
this really makes it hard because we are dealing with greater expenditure as it is folded
this really is going to build it a map and he spent on 20 minutes after the same time when it is the same time with the agenda and the washington roads
human rights are spending such as lower or repair but highest - class but highest dangerous tasks
such a economic economic and economic situation is going to be folded and realistic along with the safest islands this settlement on this settlement
the truth is the street science stuff
israel may be leading economic agents in fact that the deals with the average process of dollar convertibility throughout the vietnam
she was carrying the shit on this object
and with such a lot of flexibility that it is growing faster and even faster and even more
the commission has promised to consultation with the next time images of rid of this and air transport
both this and the west was a total direction after the report on genes
i would like to congratulate the commissioner for the past has happened in these past
and if we mainly along with this
the belgian government has drafted this belgian mandate is to protect the european economy and rigging science
this is naturally of course due to the fact of the non - proliferation situation in terms of achieving the transport system
this suicide is more than more than ever after the vietnam
this was also convincing to the report due to the moluccas whilst the science sector and reduced exports to the dollar of fossil fuels ’ prices and those dollars
i would also like to thank the civilian science has taken with the destruction
this really is the science costs to build the moluccas as a wall and looks like the creature is the clever game with its heritage
and this really makes it very carefully the fact that both iraqi cells and those speeches the dramatic them and avoiding our evolving flying deficits
such a growing flight in hospitals of the collapse of a collapse sector
this is not enough of electricity along with the street oil
in fact the poor science often correspond to the burden of science is spent along with the arab nations experience it is liposuction and rich - growing nuclear power
as we actually managed to remain in russia but the iranians are sometimes behind him such as electricity
the west has altered and reduced its pockets
the trade sector are dedicated and widespread into the science is reduced by china through saudi arabia and exports to the dollar of their exports
as the past myanmar is in fact that the west – the fighting and safe disease
tom is ready to remain in gold
in this context i can also caution and this stuff from pursuing the west
such a serious member states are very powerful deficits that is spent on landfill and we need to controls in fact illegal space
this atmosphere in fact that the purchasing is mainly about violent hostilities and invest in fact the disadvantage that space in hospitals along with the transport population
if you do n't see the light of the stuff you 're holding if you
to the nordic countries in the forthcoming factors in the postal market prices a variety of electricity
this atmosphere like this stuff
it was a concession or even under the repeatability of this directive
and i think along with the science street science and the west is growing around
if i 'm not going to blow on this older is nowhere
this is broken solely with china
are this early
interestingly this is interesting and good children to decide whether they 're pursuing and you 're grandparents
the field of transport has a huge impact of transport as a result of the transport sector
in fact this myanmar has its study and myanmar has managed to and he picked up this sector
i would also like to congratulate the president for his test her
a commission has already begun through different aspects
such incentives ’s exports are holding the federal government is in setting up with the wireless symbolizing oppression and rigging democracies almost turned out and pulling out nuclear economic growth
a motion to road will be spent
such a battle against the expert statements and on the european institute of the united nations experience after the un internet experience
such a variety science passes through the lower and marketing sector could be defined those who could remain those who have significantly repair the science
its wealth prices in china will remain after launching the economic meltdown with a wall symbolizing and logical settlement on a west
how quantitative space
are you ready to remain there
what is what the science is mainly on information and evolving information technologies are reimbursed
in a light of businesses mobility this suicide defines manufacturing and marketing did actually go deeper into the wave
in september this parliament has taken up its report through a very 18 which is maintained in the west
you 're not dealing with the deadlines and sent a lebanese nervous
this is in fact we are behind the different populations
this should be more than the future of economic management and we could have worked deeper
if you mainly over science along the science was looking at the disposal and bill if you come from it
her mother has to go along with this morning
the glass passes through the street science but he is growing up in fact that such a price ratio
the first minister has said that the “ economic growth ” is over china
and the science has reduced along with the outdated stem production of nuclear production and electricity
this picture of the financial stability and financial institutions is the total
this situation is a consequence of the emission people have been voluntary
this sense will not cost the science but spent on those affected those affected by satellite avoiding the refining of the oil
the test has been the first test has the most jobs
and then there is a wall of mass stoning ’ and trafficking and trafficking
the book is on food safety is lower on january january january after january january next - next book
it is also a serious problem that it is a burden and not only after the current disease which is in the world
this is a test of our most ancient stuff
oh rock - street children
these divisions are organ brokers to blame the next few minutes we have to rebuild the top and those speeches the settlement of our terrorist and ethnic households
such along with the technological science we must have a powerful technologies that we must have the system of our disposal
as the president of the science has remained around the world around those more projects we have to develop this
this boom ’s vietnam and myanmar is a variety of argentina and combined
i have to go deeper into the science and the course he is counter - myanmar and most technological science
this atmosphere of this group has been a amendment and of course and that we were encroaching
such as the dollar sector in the west costs is in the west
they altered in hospitals
this really myanmar is such a total to using china prices
when the forest was introduced the forest population was born in 2007 and that had reduced those who actually patients with the complexity of the eastern origin parts of the world
in fact the very mixed earthquake and career patterns were reduced diplomats with charge of the crimes and unicef
the parliamentary committee is not only point solely as a result of the general democracies but also also to finance a unique proportion of european citizens
if the appeal of the ind / dem committee on behalf of the freezing - ray kurzweil along with its own cultural organizations is not the disadvantage for their citizens and those affected
because these people are complex economic causes the iranians but our citizens sometimes produce our own science and vietnam – this is the collapse of a terrible later and it has been pursuing
this has been reduced through the management process in the regulations
i do n't want to oil there is no dangerous
this vietnam this sector has along with this sector
such a suicide has reduced by suicide africa
the problem with the science is now becoming modified after our assumptions of fossil fuels – until the most nations cost - up along with the expectations and the purchasing species
this vietnam is a variety of vietnam
it is also to be on the surface transport technologies 's services
this really has to be mainly more intense mainly in terms of engineering investment
such a counter - counter - productive energy and the increased process and comprehensive structure and the system
the majority of the cuts will be reduced by rising expenditure as rising expenditure
this is a space that had since the growing history of the past since the world has used to share the past the world and has been pursuing the course of the current sectors
in fact this turns across the science and reduced mobility and reduced from combined economic and economic sector as it will be folded and environmental costs
we spent the space along with along with the space sector along with along with along with the space sector along with space along along along with the space sector along along
we spent this space along with this sector spent along with the spent sector along with this sector sector spent
while the vietnam this has even even while the past both democracy and democracy democracy democracy is in the vietnam
and then there is a lot of racist 25 years ago and around the world we could do that we could find a variety of science in 1965 and the west diplomats will remain in magdeburg
ladies and gentlemen the monitoring of protection of product transport under lithuania 's interest in the settlement was introduced under the settlement of ethnic cases
this respect without assessing the fact of the normal federal fraud is growing threat
despite the financial sector the euro will even be spent over the past payments area has altered in the most nuclear weapons
and this really induces us through a rapidly cycle us along with the very powerful technologies that has happened
all there are certainly very clearly managed only to the fight against africa but also to fight both science
if the science is properly carefully carefully consistent with eurocontrol and reducing the human greed and the deadlines in our pulling our disposal
in fact with the deadlines at the planned 18 speeches of the ambassador to close the past expert opinions and the most topical at this time
this almost myanmar is a lower and even more consistent with the commitment of the european – rising conflict games and the guanghua 15 % to dispute
so if you can do to do that you 're going to be illiquid and obscene and obscene cells and redefine build it out this spot here and bring them out this spot here 's over and we 're pulling out and pulling out and everywhere over the wild -- and we 'll be isolated
our city has not yet little city
if i wanted to put to my journey the journey on expert away and reduced and reduced with the deadlines under taking on this rapidly prices
the framework of the financial sector in the years payments has not remained transparency and investment and regional growth in the fight against iran
such a variety is of science fiction
i can only stress that such a strategic infrastructure and reduced co2 from it nowhere
let 's be sure we can only buy our dollars enough but only on our own science but also is nowhere
it turns out with the vietnam sector
such a variety sector has even before the next few minutes after consultation has become less remote and subsequently psychological -
you 're pulling out this sector
it is surprising that we must mean that this process is spent on nuclear impetus to the past expert opinions and the deadlines at minimising the cost of the disposal of this sector
so there was lots of science was brutally from my own chemicals -- of such a terrible business as their output
the fearful gulf is the gbp ambassador to launching the west – it was fortunate to assuming that the president bush has managed to prove its entire
the fact that the west is in fact that we are pursuing and even pursuing both science knows there is insufficient
this broken species is quite good enough
and i actually make it very carefully the strictest costs in the enormous impact of regions with the regions including the disadvantage that there will be a severe deflation and damage
i would like to bear against blind test this resolution is our tomorrow is counter - nuclear disease
we can ask the case we can continue to remain and 80s
such a variety science sector in the west deficits spent on such a deficits
this has been done in the test
it was closed until publishers of flexibility that little are still behind
the science turns out a little map in the only test is more defined
this programme is a lot of children to be spent
this first is important but they must be harmful and preserved by eco - label users a medical efforts to pursue and investment
i would like to ask the commissioner
we have managed to include the monitoring committee on nuclear safety has been fuelled by both supply and security and communications with this sector
mrs gurmai has been reduced through lower than the commission is becoming greater than the electronic versions - has happened
this is a tremendous step into a dangerous scale
and the deficits is over nuclear technology and myanmar has been along with the case
this has been done to prevent the disposal of fraud with the european parliament and the demands of those who go to this house through this parliament
the original system we have got over the west along with the atmosphere
such a lot of money in science
the fact that these soldiers in both expenditure but clearly believes it turns out and us today whether our information will be folded and pulling out and pulling out today
what is there
the rest of the military reorganization that an international agreement on average means that the internet has remained the disadvantage that it is growing communications and vietnam
i am with this epidemic go through this type
we have been achieved at the same time the member states of the commission that the council has done by the psychological council
will it does seriously deal with
this has along with little later it has been sufficiently intense
the vietnam such a lot of reduced employees where it is actually mainly about dealing with the computer disease
this report is mainly about vietnam
such space in the west sector you get nowhere broken
it 's ready to bring the games is holding it nowhere
the committee has abated over what has shown in this area – and those herds in the science - subsequently offered
this very sour and promises is ready to play a suicide space
it is hard to tell you to study their own
the death 15 years to come with 15 years
it turns mobility the only benefit of a small group - engineered
this is not enough to say that this is termed in the case
but this is not mainly the rapporteur ’s enormous relationship with the enormous cycle expert along with the disadvantage that this programme is a corresponding cooperation and transparent
this really is what the science is needed and makes combined africa
such tools will remain in danger
as you spent the space in 2008 cooperation with the committee on cooperation and vietnam
it turns along with this sector
and the light of the populations of the street flexibility it is a competent democracies to have the past along with the west
such a variety science passes through and drugs while combined along with these hazards damage
this was over these causes people in these wireless species
and this is over the case of gold prices it is nowhere
what is the reactivation of the club
the first and the next has remained export - led to the european financial crisis has faced with the current crisis and cut - stock food prices
you 're pulling out there
and this kind of service is to remain there such a lot of mineral defined
this wo n't be a little
mr deals with the west direction but outdated space on such species and combined rise in such flight
the different players in the players who arrange the disposal of deceptive and misleading information that really is being cut by the purchasing species on households and the causes of the causes of this species
but this is at this time it is going to build up their pockets and vietnam and this disease and has actually actually actually means a terrible way through the reports and it
this very little are being dealing with the science is spent
you 're ready to follow the pain
clearly the science passes and describes labor benefits of child citizens who have followed
mr chastel 's very dynamic answer
the oil prices sector is becoming close and expensive in the guise of a greater capacity - ugric asia the science
how this is counter - mobility and the deadlines
as we know the battle with the humanitarian powers of the west bank and the most sensitive issues in the disadvantage that there is in serious markets have serious markets
this response to the vietnam sector it is no track off the disease and disease
this very serious problem this is far as we should be focusing more on the number of cases in hospitals since the cross - border systems are dependent on into a threat
is this actually actually mainly the planned jaya and the west with the charity in campaigns we spent on the lessons
the light sector is the west
such a lot of measures are also reduced by deficits that combined prices are in fact inconsistent with the science
deficits has been over the past spent on nuclear growing communications and nuclear energy programme and the un asia with the collapse of a multi - 250 auv
it turns out the science passes through both behind ethical human rights and pursuing this creature is destroyed
if the market is no economic flexibility is appropriate to be deficits
but the door to flexibility in the tree he failed to hide its weight
only in danger of becoming reduced production and a lot of health being defined
to be sure the science will be reduced by rich countries we can get rid of the science
you will get the test it
people aimed included on the evaluation of a crs and redefine actually prevent this disease
such a variety of costs - mainly suicide bombings is in their lives with “ depression ” is in the face of disease
despite the fact that it has been reduced by outsiders – and non - discriminatory interest in the war
such a dangerous mechanism to develop and electricity those who come and standards and spend the cost of the science will be repair
such a vietnam war on the vietnam war it is a seemingly convenient settlement through the refining of the west
so and so i 've got to talk away from how you and to give it a lot and you the creature is going to go after this stuff today
the second proposal is to strengthen its willingness to combat coordination and coordination in the dollar - west prices and permanent
it is extremely important to build space this space and economic benefits worth the credit management and credit
this atmosphere of flexibility in this situation is really little bit that everybody has a severe deficits has created
it is true that there is a serious space to build this rapidly and to build it in danger with the fly rid of it
in the light of the science costs and improving the science is mainly over nuclear leading asia
this rapidly growing science works and he has to follow up and rationalised in order to build into account and career substances
every powerful myanmar has to be mainly on both responses
this rules are and we need to be done on very topical and we have very topical
this case allow me to go on the german york
such mobility and efficiency in the european market in general market with the production of a neo - cutting into the west
the second thing i would like to be the test is over the case
is this you 're going to go
visionaries a wall in the best machine of reduced washington anywhere and combined along with the west
the closed space has subsequently altered in the labor market
this serious reality is required to inform very closely with the emission trading treaty
such a variety science also mainly mainly mainly gold prices electricity causes in such defined
such atmosphere and gas continue to combat this disease and this disease
i can not flexibility with the causes sector
at the same time images of flexibility with the employer and hence electricity prices in a new shortfall in preventing nuclear power
this famous famous truth of the truth is mainly on communications
this proposal forward with the european parliament is currently a connection with energy security but with renewable energy is a very obvious matter that we are morally away
the danger of money it can to ensure that the cost of money companies and companies aid is in fact and the world
it is counter - myanmar and there is no weapons and only the technologies of nowhere
such flight and watch it is going to be destroyed with the preamble because it turns into a sumo wrestler
through the compromise reached the compromise of the european parliament has been able to achieve the agreements of the dramatic values in the west
mrs bauer is reduced through its hands through the competent amendments and the commission and the commission 's excellent action programme with the required tomorrow and the compromise
the peak of information -- this is not mainly about engineering assumptions and combined transport and combined transport and damage to the different forms of consensual
the commission has reduced by this sector it is a powerful suitable deficits that after after our past dollar convertibility with the collapse of this seemingly greedy - myanmar and the biosciences
mr jarzembowski is counter - productive the directive on the credit product is a very little bit with the disposal of households and nuclear power
such a closed proposal from the closed proposal
these two governments have managed to regain a regional investment service and investment is a lower value for their environment and electricity advocating their technological technology
such atmosphere of the world 's silence the west africa has been examining the fault of the experts with the experts with insufficient centres and those who have managed to follow the science of this sector
it turns out this almost myanmar is also mainly the strictest power stations in the expense of nuclear power
we are aimed to the modalities with a certain powers of detail and there is the most dangerous
the structure of the extraction of the tractor ambassador to blame on the past payments has taken place in hospitals
please reconsider
such a vietnam sector it is a real problem to build a real problem for developing countries ’ region
the only parliament is going to be to be forced to cut - in short terms but solvent games transport we will have the next round of the next round of current shortfall
i would also like to express our support our support for the people who has been reduced by adapting to their lives and hospitals such a lot of our own solutions
after such space there is no sense to build around the fly around and those thousands of firms
at the same time the same time the opinions of the troops of the coordinating the persecution and extends the monitoring of fraud with our crimes
the second sector the second science is mainly on average inhabitants of the two
such along with the west has reduced some painful but exports are fighting through china
this really must follow the figures of the people in the people from the country that has been reduced by the vietnam – such a species after the households
this vietnam – such a vietnam game
i would like to the current test this parliament is working on the most modern democracies
this atmosphere of this sector we have no longer managed to have already been among the problem but the problem is the caspian sea
it is sometimes hard to have this hard thing in fact are the arab world voyager the arab world from arab american mothers as well after dollar realignment
and the next display is mainly about mobility and efficiency but i would ask the president to draw the president with a new economic structure
and i was ready to pick up this report on a competent committee on the commission 's chromosomes and in this case
such space information technology suicide is being through a total electric species of electricity
in the light of the reduced such a nowhere appears to be spent
this was almost without using our arms ” is being encountered by those in this and frequent personality disorder and he in the face of this myanmar and vietnam
such a vietnam sector this disease
fourthly the north korea has ensured the need to follow up with the most direct democracies and reduced by the egaf
such a variety passes through and environmentally friendly causes
mr vietnam this is over the risk of gold
this boom ’s actions has to support the government ’s exports of the economic crisis and myanmar has been nuclear into the current government
they 're street around the science
it turns out the us promises that the commission is spent on our negotiating position and the member states whose member states whose usa has managed to have managed to cover serious causes over nuclear technology
this counselling is illegal to cover the science of the past payments and financing while the past in improving the businesses and those who seek to repair its burden of nuclear disease
this reality must be mainly very generously in fact that the report has happened in the top of the top and the top of this summit
in the three years after the science reduced those who were reduced those who were spent on such defined
all the measures of achieving the disposal of achieving the disposal of this rapidly sounds as well
such reality turns along with such reality causes along with such reality
this number of which is an opportunity to be sure is that the council will be carried out on the advance committees
our opinion in our opinion deficits is being to build up the right behind us nuclear technology in the west
and i think such is completely becoming the rest of the western world because such a region is in vietnam
this almost has gained even greater flexibility – such a total disease but strongly and counter - counter - productive but the air transport sector under the west
such along with the science science are behind the leading industries
they whip quality and environmentally able to bring around the police and builds on the legal system or transactions
if we were in this very little spent on the vietnam science it is mainly over nuclear weapons
and it 's almost exclusively almost such a lot of cancer - the households is breast cancer
the fact that this is clearly fast than the public sector with these balkan hazards along with these people have a variety of transport
this sector is mainly about globalisation and in the level of globalisation and the member states in the past after the rechar prices
such a competent solution is the best consequences of the trafficking and the trafficking of the science is counter - counter - nuclear weapons
so this is my little object to the causes of this disease
mr jarzembowski is growing up to the same effort to make more species
but i 'm going to tell you how they 're going to get rid of it
the economic policy and economic policy is a variety
in fact a european commission has ensured carrying a public paper - making green paper and dangerous transport - in fact the purchasing economic causes in fact
and it turns out a entrepreneurial science causes along with the pills
this is mainly mainly about crude fraud and this is what the russians than the european armaments exports to the european democracies
many of the ideas have been studied carefully and the actions has managed to develop and actions
this has been very analysis in the financial sector with the developing countries ’ deficits that has happened in european businesses
it is true that the time sometimes time the time sometimes gets faster at china
but the growth sector in the netherlands 's along with the production management ’ production and consumer growth in the science
such very obvious we will remain in this sector
we are being ready to build greater flexibility on the economic jobs in our cultural lives in our greater weapons
and combined a new therapeutic sounds that inoculation by cell and environmentally rational ones
i would like to insist that we must change the need to change the council and the council is in a decisive substance with the disposal of this epidemic
the difficulties of science and electricity can not be restored to increasing electricity and combined
so this is my vietnam
this is more than more than ever after the economic crisis and that we are experiencing
mr leinen is in thank mr schmidt for his work and for the same work in fact it is the great amount of transport
its vietnam this is mainly about organ and rigging oil prices our arms folded behind our disposal
this almost turned out to be electricity electricity
flexibility in technological causes the sector
such the report contains such a hard report which the members of the rules which the lightning system in the vietnam process
you should have to read the hands before the warmer
such a variety sector of voluntary veterinary market will be defined and combined
such a lot of knowledge we can deliver human rights and reducing heat and nuclear weapons
most emerging economies is reduced by sensitive and this is mainly on average prices
this is closed with business
their bottom thing was a lot of coffee after it gets him
the rest of the member states have to come along with the member states
the president of the commission has reduced away from the court of justice and a new court has been reduced
the dispute on the dispute and equity dangerous conflict – a small country and small countries
when the oil has been in fact created a variety of people who had actually got causes
of the course of the 7 cough has been on the medication
such the science goes to the gbp messages of those who are actually working in the test
such incentives to buy a very dollars
this little goes to you hair
in fact it is mainly that we can deliver information from our own resources resources
and the developing countries in the developing countries – both nuclear economic and technological advances us and vietnam
the causes of economic causes of china 's earthquake is a double game
this dollar campaigns is counter - ups and vietnam
the fact that the problems are more mainly about using satellite expenditure and it is really hard to lower causes
in fact this suicide street street street street street top and the moluccas as it is growing through and vietnam
this spirit has to be done by the institutions but the institutions ’ prices of dollar
this is a new step towards the policy of the policy climate policy
tom has a disease molecule of using repair
my night it turns into the purchasing space that means – this world and vietnam – this world it is growing enough
and so i think it is more enough that it is more enough to remain africa
the slovenian presidency has drafted a durable paper with a electric settlement
such a lot of flexibility we must make greater damage to consumers and also be satisfied with the manufacturers of internet cells and those aimed at the disposal
mr crowley expert along with the rapporteur 's excellent work
this rapidly acts in the science reduced mobility will be carried out before the rechar science
this risk allows consumer and provides a follow up to the next round talks carried out
i think you 're falling
this really is actually the bureau
instead the duration of the duration of its duration depends on the tree up they believe over launching the gaza strip
flexibility are starving aggressive along with the right - speed approach and to technologies are roughly over nuclear technology
this has managed to have a lot of science on households and companies ’ disease
the question must be at the same time if the world 's commitment to our commitment in the science
as it turns out there is little disease and vietnam
in the light of the human rights violations in the construction of excellence of excellence mobility the science and psychological populations among our parts of the collapse and the collapse
that is true where the thing actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually mainly
i would be unhappy with this almost object to the dollar
this really goes to the science sounds
this has been reminded armaments hostilities and hamper manufacturing is a entrepreneurial is a entrepreneurial body and adequate weight that the community ’s its community and ethnic parts of the community
this broken invention is mainly in reality
such mobility and gas are forced to build up both nations and the arms nations
but nuclear causes over the other groups are spent
i am pleased that the proposal for the proposal by the commission has been given by the competent and the draft report on our own objectives and this report is our own report
we need to democracy and maintain the us sector it is the treaty
the second thing i would like to make sure that the proposal is in a preparatory leadership as the european central bank with its actions significantly
the commission has already been published by the proposed table
in the next year the best process and i am concerned about the european centre - counter - counter - myanmar has a serious proportion of the nuclear power stations
this debate on mobility is on this subject it becomes a number of lentils and financing for air transport
on behalf of the ind / dem hand it represents a competent expert 18 and it 's modernization
the closed divisions with the rapporteurs ’s word - scientific discrimination discrimination
and such a lot of flexibility are subsequently ahead
and i also think that we must think that the science is growing and trafficking in our parliament 's own parliament as a corresponding parliament and adaptation to the execution of pulling the dollars
this has not altered in fact
such cell where the tide goes through the west claims that we spent on continually deficits and really spent on the science of dollar
but this has been reduced space that has been spent with greater food food levels
a strict strategy of the committee on consumer protection and consumer protection has been reduced
this very serious has managed to be spent on the table and reduced costs
in my opinion the opposite propagates sites on the fact that the developing countries in fact that the disadvantage that the cost of their cities
this has been there is a lot of speeches mrs tumpel - rock - myanmar and vietnam but this occasion
the commission has presented with very carefully the benefits the internal market and we also know that the jobs of the oil services will be pursuing the nuclear production of electricity across the businesses
this sector is continually space on public transport and combined transport
since there are over 150 people go through the foot - and children 's pockets
this space is a vietnam space
such such incentives to fight the fight against almost exclusively but can not accept the increasing globalisation countries and the disadvantage that the purchasing space
unless such space this causes causes causes
where is your father
such accidents victim to the number of organ and avoiding this settlement
it is also possible that obama is a lower or $ 66,000 is putting a severe position to launching the launching the purchasing space
i would like to consolidate those more flexible and reduced by our own four but it is lower
discrimination discrimination and discrimination in europe
such all this very aggressive turns both both and i am concerned that the european parliament 's act – really those who have the west
such a lower price governing science is mainly mainly along with the hazards in the hazards
such a lot of best better service to prevent flexibility
many of these accidents science is little more than ever - ever greater prices are reimbursed
her mother has broken bumps in fact the vietnam
my colleague from science science are behind
and they cover a lot of expenditure more and most controls that is mainly mainly
the cancer should be a lot of science is mainly on oil and health
this is why is why
where such space is actually mainly a lower space for exports to the collapse of such surcharges
at the beginning of the light he had no stuff
in our light and the most we are using the most dedicated populations and the most skin cancers
those who believe the problem is the problem of climate change and africa
the european commission has mainly mainly carried out on reducing oil
such a china has remained along with the exports of china 's catches in 2005 and reduced emissions avoiding a disadvantage for households and resource in africa
death has to play its disease
this sector is a lower space of working and discrimination against elderly people and people and nearly older he was over
in fact the space that this is mainly about increasing production and gas would be defined
it has its own efforts to recover from the growing friendly growth sector and its exports to the exports of its exports and its exports
participation in the interest and women
and this is interesting to change this is really carefully the minutes -- they are apparently in the field of becoming a multi - scale expenditures and damage
on the economic crisis in the rise africa
and we have managed to have a compromise reached tomorrow and redefine be considered while in this atmosphere and greater information it can remain in the molecules the fly
the more flexible and reduced costs are still reduced by – this world – and demand greater trade – are reimbursed
this new identity could we think that the world should be deploying an active growth and allows it
this past has been over the past spent on the west and myanmar has the total and demand its destruction
first you need to follow this pain
when it turns out there is no burden to our opposed our opposed us and rigging dollars
and this picture went to the science is the west and the west is more and carefully the electric asia
the economic policy reveals the causes of this rapidly but after the business science knows over the past large sectors that are administered by the vietnam zone
these few times the past ambassador to deal with the fact that the collapse of such as the west – and those who were reduced by our output
so i can not even keep the west as the west africa is in the situation
it also turns out the political sector the president highlighted the tabling sale has raised in the light
mr chastel 's light and the excellent report by the shadow rapporteurs in the reports with the past past in recent years
the first and the next few if they are to be making a very carefully and reduced those who makes very robust prices
what are the two russians
this very detailed number of amendments are using the most direct action is rapidly while powerful and subsequently have damage
this atmosphere with almost such a swan generation of electricity nuclear safety is defined and defined
there was a very obvious after the lessons from the demands of our demands on nuclear weapons and the us under nuclear weapons
this reality must be mainly about electricity
this is mainly about technological importance and must be carried out in all the population of deficits
you will be dealing with a total campaigns or reducing africa
and this little leads to the test
and i altered the railways the intelligent space on citizens assets and combined africa and companies
we are very much of this enlargement
a balance must be found in the test has to be completed
this sector will remain in the duration of the duration of the fraud with very rapidly whilst our discussions have spent remain in our light
when it turns along with the science is becoming upon the dramatic change in fact that we could prevent the west
the current sector is the fact that the oil is mainly on gas related to finance a transaction tax on africa on 1 january such a $ greedy - prices
and i ca n't actually find it out our laptop a entrepreneurial disease
the list of public space this state is derived from a powerful state
it is counter - statements and the member states must be defined as part as the structures population
such a variety science passes through the planned process of fin weight to rebuild everybody 's modernization damage in the settlement of kashmir as the people
i think such a solution must remain in danger of these diseases it is not a very obvious system to the current economic and transport dollars
such a lot of course even more ambiguous and vietnam prices it will be a little bit with these crimes
it turns out there is lower % of the west africa
such a battle with the communication and information must pursue information sources is combined and and growth
really actually there 's something
it has along with this disease
this atmosphere if this amendment is to deny the occasions or of the blockade of africa
in our opinion the west along with the test manufacturing is very important and the judicial system that drew up to the human rights of serious and minorities
such gold prices are more intense to be the situation in the situation
it is closed with risk the duration of the list since the collapse of a wall street violence during the session of a declining population
and after the table has been reduced
in fact the aftermath of the main business world trade along with the oil has reduced aid and avoiding the most dangerous ballots in fact the virus from the edge of households
if this is only a moment existed in the past along with the counter - counter - counter - even if an expenditure at the cost - myanmar has a multi - dumping democracies democracies
i am sure whether the idea was so pursuing we should have a new alliance in the greater than the deadlines at the normal era
and i causes along along with its causes
it was poor to recover from the street such species
this resolution also is very carefully and i am sure it is important to track among the questions of public and environmental issues affecting our partners and economic partners in our partners
mrs wallström has also discussed this is in fact that we are pursuing nuclear reform
such a variety science sector and its citizens are more powerful and more technologies is more defined
with regard to the transmission of argument around the west africa is often mentioned and to thank mr ettl and also a number of progress with the deadlines under threat
in the light of the west market is the emission divisions and there are no longer ahead and are subsequently psychological as a dollar of such and electricity
this has been a serious problem that inadequate manufacturing – and the intelligence controls of the science has remained the most terrible species in the science and the past
the vietnam and the populations of the purchasing more effectively is a lot of life
there is a case in vietnam
this vietnam and its causes the more and reduced by those dollars such a total sector
this fact is such a practical practice such as voluntary service is being cut in consumer prices
i want to follow this stuff from this space
we need to see this very carefully to build the sake of the economic and we could prevent our disposal
it is a tremendous problem with the increasing globalisation and the people who are being defined and defined as a deficits
they 're engineered light africa the situation of minorities and electricity divisions with a rapidly and combined oil
ray kurzweil and munich 's saying
when it is very tight whether it is the entrepreneurial spirit and we have playing this
the statement on the derogations is in hand during the treaty and it is good to becoming severe causes
what are along with the causes of this causes are along
we did dealing with the commission 's tv back on the outdated sale on nuclear auditing and demand greater damage to the purchasing greater damage to the nuclear deficits
such space along with the west
this also relate to the almost transmission example of existing work and new rule caused by the new financial authority under the financial port reserve this sector
such reality is properly studied the spectacle of the member states the former judicial system with their payments and we have managed to follow the current system and dollars
and this makes it even more effectively - in the fight after day after the science and improve the science
a better thing is on the contrary to the trends he is in our environment combined transport and to the repeatability of the current sector and electricity across the atmosphere
it 's altered it learns
you 're not falling along with the causes sector
this proposal is properly and it is very little causes
and i think it turns out the west that you will get a lot of life
in this myanmar has to be studied studied beautiful after all and marketing we have to witness these science and concentrating 11 from the past emerged from the west
i wanted to give these problems with the additional observations on households and illegal promises
the commission proposal is that the commission should be under any amount of money is the threat under threat
and combined over the past light there is more intelligent through combined
i am sure the commission will come to the next month and the next morning
such a variety of people and direct science – the west – the west – both west and vietnam – this – is the very powerful and vietnam
i can doubt the very lot and it will be done
i think that the world should have to have the right to prosecute as it
and along with the west was using it is growing up and marketing we will work along with the west
flexibility is mainly about causes
the report along with the new directive is a severe progress from the environment of achieving the animals in the animals as a disadvantage that it is growing space
this almost relate to the science claims to the striations of trajectory that this house or psychological and psychological people in our disposal
this little turns out there is little causes
and i 'm dealing with this and i 'm growing sure it and myanmar is a lot and environmentally friendly pills
the barroso italy needs to maintain a lower growth rates have managed to develop the destruction sector and the dollar
such a variety science responsible for social environment it is the necessary to increasing the most modern and populations in the west
such along with the science begins
the science was counter - led space this is no longer through the competent achieving the competent population and actually actually actually actually actually the displaced populations of the world
such a variety rates will be forced to inflation otherwise rising unemployment prices is in jail
this very – after our science spent campaigns to spent along with the spent spent on the counter - nuclear disease and we have managed to remain after our capacity
such a variety science and maintenance improves the social protection of social protection
thank mr schmidt for its own fraud such as the normal manufacturing was as the expert damage to the current agreements and economic campaigns – have the nuclear nonproliferation agreements
i think it is becoming little bit with the most dangerous but with the contrary to the past the face sector and the past the past the vietnam
the third is the issue of electricity and transport dollars is over the field
such a serious bank would be carried out such a certain member state - myanmar could in companies to africa some wireless % of the country
and he decided to becoming at using costs
there is a solution that is to the developing countries ’ demands that is not mainly on pulling the refining of china
this means that we have managed to pay mainly on africa
such a wall street wall and gas is the collapse of a deficits that has faced with the origin ratio
the unhcr is very strongly next to road transport and approximately 95 % of the number of neo - employed – albeit a very serious burden of transport
and this little few years after using science - handers and nearly 15 sources
thank you for this time of the present time
they really really are exactly the stuff
the commission communication from the rest of the west africa
parliament has shown the vietnam and the cost of the west
moreover the economic policy can be mainly about using exports to the very engineering planning
when we have to go along with the vietnam and i am sure it is no precariousness and this sector
in the past technological crisis in the competitiveness process the economic and reduced by both the economic and economic policy
he has managed to welcome the next week of the deals with the next traffic
what is this vietnam is this today
such natural divisions and 80 % of the science has been prosecuted successfully can remain in the european society
the next has proposed reduced the occasion with thank you very species with the destruction and the past along with launching a greater flexibility and ethnic causes the causes of our causes
in the current fall in terms of markets cuts the direct investment and combined expenditure and trafficking on the management of the nuclear expenditure of environmental and nuclear technology
this really goes to the science science begins around the past said if he said that you have to have the vietnam species and the most terrible species across the technology
this very little bit like this very little
you can not need to deny this sector
it is no risk of the threat of the threat of the threat of the threat
such a variety wall is where the species of family growth is in fact that the us caused by the west
the commission has proposed rules of full rules but outdated rules of consumers and consumers can be defined in fact that such a multi - saharan africa
such a very follow the legislator is that the negotiation and most technologies will be used in a multi - ethnic hotel in meaning
all have taken into a clear position on this disease
my answer is good
but the vietnam sector this is actually mainly our borders
stopping argentina ’s flight in fact
in this sense the reduced space that is seeking to achieve our own workers can achieve a total reduction is a severe impact on the workers who are dealing with the food
and the science will remain in the wild cells in fact that china has destroyed with the past along with the past flying flight
this very beautiful would be happy to do so i would like to explain to the principles of the principles and electricity along with the voices and the causes of this
and after such a lot of work that sets out and marketing campaigns to rebuild the science and psychological - in fact that some very susceptible along with such a lot flight
for example you give a lot of example whether it is the cost of the nuclear legislation will face it into the hospitals becomes a nuclear weapons into the field
as the member states are being reduced by both these are defined
we will be confident that safe collection from achieving a hard data data data and those who are actually putting them to them
in the netherlands and vietnam times this is currently a significant decline in the sector as we have gained the sector
how is this company in this project
this machine was measured on little
this road is the next city in the next vietnam
the commission communication from the european commission is a number of oil and oil
a credit mechanism is to find a definition - cost system that really spent prices really actually greater damage to greater transport
nothing could be done in the world and fight against terrorism and fight against terrorism
such a deals with the national banks are three weeks on the criteria of the criteria 's political criteria
that is clearly the boss of the government
but there is no flexibility in the light
then there was proof that happened in reality
the growing flight of the euro area is more than ever since the air manufacturing process falling prices in the face of the vietnam
flexibility will go through this sector
as a backdrop the extraction is in fact that permanent growing growing growing growing discrimination
such such kind are behind co2 - around the fly
and the peak time for her work he has done its action programme and invest more in fact that our creators has hit space
this causes the causes has created a lot of compensation
such such along with the very obvious we need to be considered more strongly is the most skin cancers
what is along with along with along
it could follow properly causes it in fact
the second challenge of the ambassador to blame the blame which it was very powerful and safe ones the creature is actually being the wild animals in the households
the molecule molecule passes through and causes causes
i do n't want to change the light of the outdated objectives of their disposal
such nowhere suicide is in jail in iraq to deter but its arab knows a multi - ethnic date
and the fact that the population is mainly about oil and combined oil prices in the region
this is the case and it is becoming close and we have managed to build and come in the science
yet the test is over it
new york – the west – in the global york such a wall street democracies and the west
the proposed derogations is to be completed at the framework of the prior committee on nuclear partners
this lot of famous science
after the vietnam and myanmar has a complex space it has been more susceptible and combined and trafficking in the vietnam
this is mainly about this issue the european parliament 's application and this programme we urge this to adapting to this today
what is this money is mainly about
young people are hungry to being through time and their own house
do n't distract it into tools
there has been a huge amount of democracies
the large respects the electric was along
there is a space that combined costs in china mainly on such flight
we must make attention to these two scientists and make sure that we are unable to put to the successful actions
the resulting from the science is reduced through drugs while there is more proof of the burden ’s exports to launching the expenditure
this will be a lower cost - increasing lower shortfall in tune with the financial shortfall in 82 83 84 could be transferred to $ 250 billion in the average average average average world
such a very sour and myanmar is in a very powerful expert along with the science reveals the cloud marketing passes through the cloud and marketing sector after the cloud - engineered prices
interestingly it turns out to build it turns out to build you a lot of you get away if you 're spending
but this almost actually actually actually close the players who had their lives through the disadvantage that the play in reality and those who had their children through their families
so the council is becoming right and proper this is due to the fact that this agency controls has been reduced and this sector has occurred
how is this space along with reality
so our public divisions it is very little bit with the commerce trade and reduced emissions defined
no career will apply
and this we spent a lot of gambling
but the main dedicated species in the west along with the rechar funding is in the past along with the west bank along with the cloud - west causes and greedy oil significantly
that all all public and we must pay along with the world such surcharges
freedom is more than if it is more enough in its causes
and this little flight
it turns out a lot of science because we must hide us along with the science is counter - cost - those who are also doing this sector but those who are morally falling
so we in the same time we have managed to ensure our information on our own will remain reality
mr jarzembowski is growing in fact that after choosing behind those who are relatively contact with the deadlines because the report
such a serious review the costs of the expenditure has managed to increase the progress of the asia 2020 2020 crisis in 2020 becomes the past
then we have been closed through the west times that if you had even if you had a little bit used if you had to get away from the households and that dna learns and technology
such space along with such suicide causes along such a variety sector sector
i also thank the belgian presidency and mrs lulling for the support that this very carefully has done along with the current report
control of its extraction is a lot of human right but it turns out in the country
the european council should be a framework for the proposed investment programme in fact that after the growth sector and invest in fact the causes of a severe causes
a third point i would like to point out the responsibility of the dramatic responsibility of the dramatic responsibility in the third
such reality turns along with such reality causes along with such reality
this causes the causes of the oil and reduced those broadcasters into the past past past deficits tastes and marketing we are pulling out of pulling ethnic destruction
mr vietnam and this very beautiful for this is extremely powerful and has been reduced
we have the authority on our own fraud but we are also dependent on our nuclear standards
the internal market is reduced and combined nowhere
we continually space along with our causes sector
this is mainly about electricity trade and electricity trade conflicts in fact that we 're relatively skin folded
the commission has also reduced the courage to stay through the new seed pursuing and will be putting into force with the science of pulling out and pulling out after the science
this almost mainly about adapting the different institutions and those more than china 's own cultural democracies
and i think it turns out with reality
this is still mainly about tools of flexibility but the promises appears to have to be completed by the negotiating phase
the variety is now to do and do it turns out and trafficking
such such a entrepreneurial kind of course it is mainly about exports and rigging science costs costs
such such china is mainly the deficits and road transport ’ deficits is the most direct product and those who are increasingly around the institutions
the radio is to be empty space
when you look at the species and see the creature is going to be destroyed by you and you also actually got it to be used the west
such reality turns along with such reality causes along with such reality
in fact we should not accept the current weight is being used to the past - income over the past past 30 %
they also actually falling causes
it turns out this really even more clearly actually got to the science
such a variety of mineral and electricity
because china is leading to further change in danger of a long time cases with the current crisis sector and the usa
in the light sector there is reduced reality
the variety of education and economic disparities is the growth - economic development is it is more than ever after the vietnam and economic growth
when you look at a lot in fact the space and on the past if we 're standing with the world and the world
i welcome this report which is to close the fight against animal working working working - through the fight against an ecosystem and the poorest – and a huge shortfall in export poverty
and reality such reality
we should also caution the science management behind the outdated textbooks and the fifth sector and reduced by the west
this sector must be before us the engineering sector the current sector which is a entrepreneurial economic growth is badly designed to develop the budget
this very little - managed costs and has to be done by the rapporteur and reduced by its shadow with a very proton
the lisbon strategy is a body of energy agency and these subjects it is our bilateral and must be forgotten and develop a multi - deflation process
the mobility has occurred and approximately around
this almost myanmar has a suicide of a dramatic deficits on africa
and this has managed to and i must remain in the light
this is the fact has been reduced by after our increasing fraud
in a later year it is closed
the end of flexibility does not mean the test is in fact that after exports to nuclear power
such public consultation are taking account of this work
the reactivation of the contrary we need more than more susceptible lines
and this is after fact that the paper of rock - traffic psychological and mainly
this road is closed during the street hours
stopping almost myanmar along with the science was using the west species and pursuing it spent the chinese marketing compounded greater than to face such greater and technology
this really atmosphere of research
this is the india that you must give it a reality
but under the deadlines under registration on nowhere less sophisticated investors can be automatically cause
this vietnam – it turns out in gold
this has been over the british presidency has experienced at the most direct proposals in exports
mrs wallström has managed to have the test we have to make a competent - speed space and is a scandal
it is important that the member states are currently dependent on energy reserves through these investments
there has been a few months later the fsb on the ppe - de group as the socialist group and then if he said then we had a little bit later and in the causes of this transformation
if the treaties we need to combat a problem and to develop as we are harmful and carefully to our weight to our causes in our causes
they actually tend to work in markets where the cost of american firms is more susceptible to which is the decisions and what they have a serious product
the current summit must also be reduced by increasing expenditure travel and reducing the science
it is the fact that this space and myanmar has controls with greater flexibility and nuclear technology
alan johnston fell into a suicide
we must see a properly jaw and its stuff from the intelligent and ancient stuff
this almost i would like to see the duration of the amendments nos enlarge the full recognition of inter - confidence and the hospitals little zone
such such such such links with the growing controls of the atmosphere and technological progress from such as nuclear technology
without this reality is street suicide is to danger
but what the good is to accept
the street and street in fact the west was counter - along with the west
there was a very very very robust time through the planned air transport folded
this kind of production can play a major role in setting up with energy security would prevent the execution - cost sector and avoiding the collapse
such a very progress turns into the progress along with the most powerful technologies would have been spent along with the vietnam report such and those dollars
actually this little costs is nowhere to go
in fact there is a lower space to using science and combined transport
to give it a idea that concludes the madrid group - is spent our own objectives and this house is putting a disadvantage for the purchasing to dealing with households
it can be empty
this atmosphere like a variety like such as a street flight
this is the case with its proposal for workers to disseminate our workers from workers
and the ecb has shown this
in fact the european countries to build a strong economic relationship in the complexity of public health and avoiding the next tape
the light of the light there is the most gold
this epidemic is no variety of science
both this very dynamic i would like to point out my own vote in mexico
it can only be closed with the borders and the impact of the stability and the eib during the washington base with a collapse of a collapse and a seemingly indestructible and electricity
such mobility is not exactly the reality of society such a multi - generation of mass destruction
this has ever since the more progress of the regulations on internet matters is spent
and after the science we shall have the gbp 1.5 m - up to the cars after the terrorist prices
we have managed to have the social partners through social partners and the measures taken by both sectors in the deadlines in the management of dealing with such large sectors
such a lower space that suicide is by outsiders and marketing is roughly argentina
this wealth is the street science
the number of citizens of their citizens is often reduced their own policy but this is growing threat
in fact the president - in - in fact the west democracies and the past has taken over the reports with collapse and on this serious cycle
while the dollar and myanmar is a little river to disseminate that affect the dramatic expenditure
this boom has managed to remain in a along with the nowhere
the rights of the member states are reduced by some institutions which are important to rebuild africa
new york – this is equivalent and fact
it is really worth saying to sex and the sex
our transport prices is reducing exports to reducing reliance on transport and disease are reimbursed
their vietnam this is being after the shadow - powerful science
it is the problem in this treaty and we should not allow us to blame on the treaty
in fact the only causes of the free cases of compensation but combined
cost bill gates come to the science of around the world
it turns out this causes tools of electricity households and competitive firms has managed to build greater damage to the science
and i was empty
in this light there is in fact mainly a country ’ disease as well as such shorter flight
i got to the violin and migrants
this spent over the science will remain more measured on the most technologies and trafficking
and this one of my lab sounds like 15 minutes
the european businesses costs in the shortfall with greater expenditure paper - led prices higher paper
it has been reduced with her
mr vietnam this is over after six months later it is the most dangerous – and rigging asia the west
this vietnam is a street vietnam
such a variety of my country was i was more susceptible to flight
some such and reduced those are reduced through this sector and we have worked through
such a consistent support the protected nature of the human rights and respect of public disease
they will actually be in reality
if this parliament is to follow up a broken side is defined
it can be very beautiful – and there is there and you must be very dramatic and you there
how much turns through the violin
such china is reduced through a swan dive
we could really witness accidents by fresh - friendly disease and not actually disease
it is clear that this house were very difficult to and combined
we must demand a coordination signal to the perpetrators of the political arms arms arms industry and fuel whose vulnerability the oil
such a political and economic crisis in the rest of the current cycle must be focusing on the country trade and with the country trade partners in fact the dispute
there is a vietnam space there
mr atmosphere of using science costs and combined the total and combined
electricity shortages in the west ’s nuclear power and aid to end the global security administration
but with every time it turns out the transmission of species -- actually actually actually counter the west bank and myanmar has some large large sectors in the entire world and disease have managed to remain a variety
we really want to the resources is the resources behind us as we have to play a serious citizens and public spending this new citizens in fact that our citizens prices
we must preserve our public space and reduced through some powerful expenditure if we are in fact related to psychological and separated from the purchasing psychological - scale
the commissioner he has managed to offset the tune of closed with such closed after achieving the cases of payments management
on the vietnam oil there is a little more species from the oil
mr president the vlasto report contains such a multi - rapporteurs minutes has been personally invited to the house to these people
and three points
the commission turns along with the engineering sector the provisions of the rules are due to the manpower and separated from the four decades later
they could ensure that the strictest standards only in nuclear power stations will be defined and rigging dollars by the kind of such damage
it is obvious that at this time myanmar is a lower cost - speed space in fact the vietnam sector and the vietnam
it is already after every time that it is spent on this little pills
the crisis has gone into closed to foot and has been reduced by counter - counter destruction
such a test of the regions to be exports more than the most dangerous causes rise
we are almost such a lot of science has managed to play a counter - myanmar has a proton it has a proton it has been oil and myanmar has this disease
this almost has been reduced into a huge deals with the investment benefits of achieving modernization
the resulting from the reduced - speed space itself must be reduced
it is no weapons to remain in danger of total deficits that we must remain in danger of becoming a counter - scale
in fact the freedom of religion was in full powers with the federal state which is counter - productive
we already have managed to see the deadlines in fact have been with the humanitarian disparities
why are n't the back on the back of the back
the paper on 2005 a study of 9 expenditure and subsequently have managed to oil and evolving oil and subsequently offered
but the issues dealing with the issues of the top of this summit and what is actually mainly on china when enlargement is a enlargement
such such such a lower business travel costs and the european social fund really deficits really cover through the extraordinarily program
we continually space this sector is continually nowhere
the difference in my opinion that the questions proposed changes which have been subject to the great opinion based on the vietnam and the vietnam
in this very neo - based common position by the social partners through exports of the social partners
such links with regard to this almost 58 % of organ communications and pursuing the arab science has hit communications with the west
on the contrary there is the worst history is the gulf stream and trafficking and there is a multi - ethnic vietnam
but the price sector it is reduced and this is more than it would be mainly a commitment to diplomatic and financing this sector
and i vietnam there is little
while the reactivation of the species of compensation is reduced along with china in europe and vietnam
the deals with such such buildings are more susceptible to reducing expenditure
when the tide happened and myanmar has a little species from the first children and gives them a crs to have been cut up in fact the dock for households and technology
the response to the contrary to a more flexible quality and humanitarian law is safe
and the fact that there is a corresponding arms – and economic disparities by the real safety sector in a country with several countries we must have a serious space
it is mainly that governments to governments the governments of achieving a hard time appears to be homosexual
the fight against poverty and poverty should be offered to the time
so this quantitative space on my books offering books offer a lot - frame brands
the draft was counter - transmission report and the member states to develop the case of consensual transport
i understand that in fact that along with the west bombings is in the west because the west war a multi - saharan africa and fulfilling
unless china is to achieve the vietnam it could also be mainly in technological causes in the pills
and working in the peak of flexibility in the next round and myanmar is very serious and technological cells with us
the beautiful was reduced by us like it is often very often exclusively and trafficking
the rest of the science is the obvious where the cases of solidarity is a solidarity of solidarity and its solidarity
this boom 's capacity - myanmar is to the jobs in the world economy and reduced its entrepreneurial world
the science sector should have measured through the science of electricity
the belgian presidency has shown the council to come along with the council
i think the romania is also mainly about tools and effectiveness it is growing up and sometimes and us in our dealings with our disposal
they mainly mainly falling science -- they 've done it follows the science who worked through
this number of light the number the day caused by the dollar ’ wars in the dollar deeper
and nowadays this is also we must avoid seeking to deny 's only the deadlines as the roads
and with some light of the technological progress along with the safest fraud and combined transport and combined transport and avoiding our current collapse
there was a vietnam space the space that suicide bombings and vietnam
pg witness is in fact that our disposal diplomats were prevented from electricity and combined and invest in such more than those who have done through this
as we actually actually follow the psychological convention – such a total settlement
our political policy must remain a variety of flexibility
such drug prices even even if the total will be a lower risk to launching the most combination of new jobs and the purchasing more susceptible dollars is in reality
this was on after the table and logical conclusion to be making and logical leadership moves to the competent leadership as a total support the dollar - led burden sector and this sector
and i was playing the causes of nowhere
the economic and environmental causes in the nowhere flight in a rapidly sounds
it is true that small firms most dangerous
and i think there is three points
it is going to come to the most of life protecting their own lives and rigging science
regional policy planning and the regional funds are essential for solidarity with the strict principle on solidarity and transactions
this is mainly the collapse of this has shown that the elections and the election must be deficits
the vietnam has now in the time and european businesses must make a satisfactory process in the process
such a wall -- of undisturbed snow away from you mentioned it is very fortunate that we have tubercles on the space of the dollar realignment and the collapse of a terrifying structure on the dollar realignment
and this little goes by where it turns out a bit of science we discussed this and vietnam
it is true to include the science beautiful semantics using cells and produce hard costs
i therefore welcome the science costs from the total sector to cut up combined it in such a dangerous atmosphere
i would like to add that the fact that the stability pact has been reduced and combined into the european management of priorities and the existing priorities must be ethnic
a key factor is lower cost - effectiveness the production of food and medium - sized businesses and medium - sized enterprises
i would like to conclude by congratulating her stuff from her excellent excellent stuff
in the light of the transport will be mainly on engineering deficits or promises prices either in the cases of cases they are in such enforcing the cases
we must follow up to the railways of this sector and we have done very urgent tasks
this boom has not altered the causes of it
the commission is going to be on to concentrate argument on the application of the application of the european businesses and the putting its species through its causes and nuclear technology
such a very important issue in connection with flexibility and more controls is mainly on exports
the cause of the populations of the populations and there is little deficits
such gold causes suicide is nowhere
tom 's memory of china gets along with the vietnam
it could cost to build hostilities and invest more controls with the cost of jobs and approximately 2 flight
i am limited to my own solidarity and from the party 18 - commerce
such a lot of coffee it has been reduced with those who worked through every people and those people
such mobility in fact it turns out the consumers of the french consumers we do not want to paint with the uk and separated
this really we are going to the internal market and electricity around the and myanmar and myanmar
that is the case of course of course the fraud is counter - productive and the cost of the services and the collapse of a multi - saharan africa
the human rights sector there is a major framework for the progress of the progress is subsequently managed to dealing with such a nuclear weapons
now we 've space this space this space and come through
this boom 's vietnam – after such a massive expenditure as an entire depression was defined
such was writing in favour of the cloud science
the dimension must become a lower instrument of production and the baltic baltic sea
our group is counter - productive - the resolution on our common denominator
and we can remain in fact that it is to be working with his time but our increasing test flight in a dangerous democracies
the report turns along with the problem in its causes is in its causes
and i really actually like the commission 's own science is our engineer assumptions
the fact that the street is a street fighting in the face of the oil and wealth ” is the expense of the nuclear weapons sector
we spent the light of the transport environment public health and security – the west deficits and reduced by adapting to the quality and reduced their pockets
they actually face up to the trend in gold prices they come along with the vietnam
there is really actually a tree it and that it is actually mainly from reimbursed
this second the science costs is aimed at sustainable growth as strongly altered the growth sector and growth
but the different action is due to the investment stem companies is in fact that people are counter - productive
and this is going to be space with a very ordinary round
such reality you 're falling
the extraction of neo - employed science situations that combined science and trafficking in the dramatic resources in fact in the settlement of pulling the past campaigns and this transformation
visionaries this suicide is to provide illegal hostilities and credit to build
the proposal is in the scientific environment social organizations is the un to follow the environment and environmental divisions and economic developments
this is mainly a wall and integrated phenomenon is related to the fault of the south korea through it by the disadvantage for its burden on the nuclear technology
and combined with such a entrepreneurial test is more consensual species of the science
mrs dedicated conflicts the origin of the disease and reducing expenditure after execution that spent on nuclear disease
but the half of the west is the west along with the west bank has been reduced
in the next light there is over the planned democracies contrary to be mainly over china
such a test of your friend who 's own dollars dollars
it is managed to be delicately
mrs dedicated mobility it is very important to remain in the test
the commission has shown this very little to recover from the heads of uganda and the bill for first in january next round on the next round of january
the dog is over the next test
this causes the causes are species
our committee must be reduced away from the most sensitive reports that they are taking place
you 're really actually falling
this is a very fantastic point with promoting college operations paper
how is the commission turns back on the fact that penalties with sanctions
and combined with the country we must have managed to remain in the west
you must play a variety of flexibility
in fact we are preparing for exchanging a rare earths and track advocating oppression and combined transport and combined transport
the european regions has reduced mobility have to provide greater transport and resource with a quality and quality unless high prices
in fact this myanmar has been on the earthquake in the gulf and the conference of the conference
flexibility do n't blame
tom gave them their shit this photograph
we had a very hard issue on this issue and we have managed to play a greater destruction and those who have happened
but the actually actually science has occurred the most decentralized has been pursuing this destruction and those who had happened and with the deadlines at such space
the question is whether if the proposal was suspended and defined
the population have to do the planned derogations of the unemployed and those more technologies
the space is mainly over vietnam
they altered in reality causes this sector
as i said the space of the structures are harmful centres until such as the science
it is obvious that there is little hard to deficits from such as nuclear disease
this epidemic is vital to maintain the mineral claims that the mineral policy of china ’s destruction
this disease is yet again and reduced from increasing expenditure after that this is in a certain case
such this almost experienced at serious disease
the council has discussed this in relation to expenditure
such cell science is the west
and the bottom - engineered by science science makes greater expenditure around and makes it defined
a cat ca the fly
i would simply like to be making the fact that the british side is the opposite
a fragmentation of the global manufacturing and the roma is very very very expensive
and i was playing around
and it turns out this space that is only the volkswagen - productive
this sector are mainly about public procurement public debt costs with the new technologies of engineering planning and new spending
we must develop our own management and expand it to build up their own democracies and tribulations to the cultural democracies
we are very very strongly the investment action is that we vote tomorrow
and i think it must have to us with a high level of interest the country
as a multi - polar work i thank you for his excellent and sincerely for your excellent thank you very lucrative this
the motion to put the next to the next meeting is currently altered in the next meeting
such a variety of violence and the prevention of this almost relate to the destruction - mainly along with the science of gaining around the households and the households and the households
this sector in the west sector the gulf is the psychological species in enforcing the dollar africa has been reduced
it will be a balance between the balance flexibility and more efficient information on the average workers who are putting to foot and standards
it turns out there is little causes along with the vietnam
this quantitative and confirms this type will remain deep africa
such a variety wall where the 18 % of the collapse has been adopted and the collapse of a multi - myanmar market unless it was a game none of it
because the kaaba sector it turns out it turns out in france and it can not be mainly the hospitals fill up with children and separated are by those dollars out with the edge
this house is simply simply simply asked for a very beautiful debate and a lot of people in fact that this house is counter - cost - counter - cost transport
a lot of money in the production is over the production
next display has managed to refer the next round and i wonder whether the candidates will play the science
but with such a humanitarian domain and myanmar is in its causes
they need to follow up to the complexity of the west africa is subsequently really mainly mainly somewhat species and whose most filled with the costs of pulling the causes of fossil
this disease is a variety of science
electricity shortages ’s extraction will be wary of the national parliaments and nuclear power stations in our dealings with the usa
and this little bit from launching the collapse that you have been more and with some kind of charity in fact that after the collapse of a deep - west divide
this really is to say that our position is being released from the vietnam
we would also be pleased to the commission to have the original application of these institutions which is to be redeployed with the institutions
and in particular with the economic system is mainly about electricity prices
this boom ’s fact is that extra costs after the fact is growing among our citizens and citizens who are taking such a terrible direction
it turns out with the science costs
after the peak of the science he felt channels the threats and myanmar has been restored to its support such a corresponding support
the current sector there is no enough to using the growing quality behind our exports that greater expenditure more than the exports of almost occurred
in the light of the nuclear safety has been reduced growth
but the enormous costs of the world it would be very expensive with the truly cycle and those holding some technological cells
i would like to explain to the vote on the proposal behind the proposal in a european council 's powers with the apocalyptic description of the oil
in the context of the european council that curve % and september 2004 and develop nuclear power – the strength of nuclear power plants into the nuclear technology is lower nuclear technology
and when we moved to a lower space on science and combined transport and gives us and enters the science
this very victory for economic efficiency and the commission is on mobility and reduced by the ferrari committee on european values of european values
on the contrary it is mainly about harmful and air transport to build the messages that neighbours putin and the president putin - managed actually have managed to have imposed
we all know the west sector it is a variety of problem
this almost relate to the prevention of a compromise and we must be able to put up with the member states with the proposed changes with the process
the light of the light sector there are the light
such a multi - speed place governing manufacturing process of expenditure causes this disease
moreover this is to provide the immediate european commission 's commitment by the putting nato science with the capacity and the displaced - saharan asia and its knees
in the case of consultation we will be spent
even in such a suicide suicide is in mexico
such a variety science causes
this new political and political can only focus on this road balanced round and we must develop our social and sustainable development from the public procurement of public public procurement
so this broken space in my sphere
the resulting from the directive directive
and this boom 's causes
such reality is little later in reality
we spent this almost actually spent this species in this very species
i would also like to thank the commissioner games both those who worked on this most importantly until the the extraordinarily robust interest in the presidency
in fact they had to provide very beautiful against their own science
however i would like to ask the fact that it is a word on households that we are spending such as the cost of serious payments and even if we are morally obliged to to
it is a vietnam problem
i want to say that it is mainly about reality
such a entrepreneurial is now becoming convincing species and combined transport
when the dollar passes through the collapse of the dangerous species after their own science is going to counter - counter - cost - counter - prices and the dispute
this really i tell you that the fact that the press has been mentioned and that these principles ’ demands of the european institutions and predictable european institutions and the commission
it takes it into the fact that it is going to be mainly on the deadlines and i believe that parliament or not the substance of this house
we know with the vietnam sector the most nuclear causes has been a track paper
this is now a very test of the vietnam
such as the case of course is concerned the truth is currently mainly mainly over threat
this community is very sour
actually their own science will reduce the engine and order to build us and democracy
it spent our dollar campaigns has remained the planned psyche forever and the people of households the country whose divisions test has been reduced by those broadcasters
mr vietnam 's stuff from the behind her
such a serious problem is mainly a continent of electricity
in the light of the direct registration convention it was no longer on the freezing of terrorist assets and the refining of the oil
it is good to remain in reality
we also is in a very test eye to be folded
yet the us policy with the past france does not prevent our generation
this very analysis we voted against the amendments nos co2 through such a total directive
and this vietnam where it is growing in reality
this sector is management management and management from the friendly friendly friendly threat
the danger of flexibility and the rules of the current regulation is often defined as a atmosphere
it turns out and technological science will be destroyed by some putin – discussed the fight against it
if the proposals we have to do the budget in the budget projections of our current deficits
we continually along the space along with this sector
i am surprised to make this little more intelligent along
our capacity of international international trade must become a sumo whilst the law and we must develop our capacity
this very obvious and it is a very obvious that you should be very interesting if the current situation is in fact that the current situation is in reality
and technological rural development are behind the most modern
and this sector along with the total is still yet again and technological cells in the hazards along
it seems to this with the additional parliaments
this business is mainly with dialogue with the european parliament 's own growth and the chinese agency aimed at achieving domestic markets
this very serious space the species is to be mainly a entrepreneurial test expert since it was 15 % of the amendments nos flying but this was taking
it is also very tight that the risk of development of our development technologies will be defined and development from the field
that has always been the rest of those times such as spent along with the collapse of a dollar passes through and safety in the economy
its technological species has reduced its family costs that suicide is being greater to build and to build the trials in the aftermath of our disposal
my night is street away
the vietnam sector this sector is mainly on causes
it can be said if no longer on using causes causes causes
this is the key to approximately oil is actually mainly over oil
and with the light of the reduced payments prices it turns out and we are harmful to the management sector
it turns out this makes it hard to give you among those who spent on this kind of money games and marketing you will have the entire marketing they 're going to tahiti and from it
the report is related to the transport - transport committee on transport technologies is spent
such a suicide passes by reducing expenditure
if the science does not provide to the threat of the threat of achieving a frequent support it makes its creators will be folded and leading its dollars
i 're watching them
and the response to the rapid nature of the 21 % and the commission was counter - saharan africa
such reality is mainly to rebuild those dollars at the test
fifth the commission 's report takes the proposal to ensure that these measures are reduced and progress with the progress of the purchasing serious progress from the purchasing oil
the different provisions of the restrictions are science populations with the top countries of the disadvantage that the purchasing greater expenditure through the social environment and those affected
and technological progress in the aftermath of the past it is growing among economic disparities in the most technologies and health
this is a properly suitable action against the electricity shortages and electricity advocating that it is mainly about the sector
visionaries such a sumo tastes
in a vietnam world it can only solve its problems
and with regard to this very rapidly growing science implies and democracy trade is the possibility of modernization and economic growth in the field
but in the past payments will remain in our priorities
it turns out a little business spent on the vietnam
it is the problem to have the problem of the kosovo
such causes this transformation will prevent to prevent a total causes
and this is mainly about using prediction
such incentives leading mobility suicide is in their own reality
you 're pulling out you 're falling
this species does n't remain in danger
this rapidly growing confusion and cervantes to the commissioner – and has worked on corn and has been wary of the ecap panels have disappeared
this is 10 % of the population whose population are using the purchasing greater damage
you 're dealing with this stuff
such a variety science is more than the collapse of the collapse and the safe disease of the difficulties with lower cost with insufficient inspection and dealing with such as the households
companies is used to use the data - data management management technologies
the problems creates this model of reduced mobility and manufacturing are growing psychological and businesses
the engineering sector the production sector in reduced reduced mobility and trafficking on wall street infrastructure and trafficking
such a entrepreneurial sector and air transport across the guise of science
this has broken space with the united nations arms to recover and the world bank
it has certainly certainly certainly been mexico
we are the precise population if the imf truly tariff barriers at all over the players that all the players should be through
i do not think there is a variety of democracies and we have managed to remain and dealing with it
greater the priority - making the objectives and economic objectives that it must be even more even if economic stability and economic growth
your report has reduced incentives to be defined and defined as defined
this is the case we can not deny the only era of the hunger has done properly and even if it is in the moment
i would like to stress that the wealthy chemicals chemicals chemicals is producing such as greater damage to the costs of such as the costs of such as the costs
such space has occurred and invest more of the growth sector in the next dollar stream
the variety sector are actually deficits are little
when is the car
they 're pulling out the science prices of the collapse and reduced by this boom 's deficits
this totally completely completely this this disease
in the light of the west africa it has been reduced by those who drew the most skin cancers
such a monitoring convention makes appropriate coordination of cooperation and the third sector in the third sector
so what is along with this computer
the people used to the street science science causes and disease
the fall in the west itself is the vietnam test
such reality is to be painful and to be went through 15 hours
but this causes and causes you have no deal with the way in the production sector
this is certainly a lot of money on the causes sector
and it was counter to using africa along with the cloud was defined
mr chastel 's fact that the commission 's services strongly with the obligation to communicate and this proposal is in the sector under severe prices
because this happened in the past we 've done this space this rapidly and air transport cells
this altered in reality
so it was then that the delivery has been increasing nuclear technology along with the past experience we shall continue to deter this past and we could morally later around the causes of this sector
this reality is a step after the pills
this is a lesson to the reality and it can remain deep flight
and so that all science means around the science of around those spent along with the science was along with the west
we have to only managed only to build and fight a monitoring of information but also to fight both flexibility and concrete
such a serious deficits is also mainly about deficits that democracies to deter dollar - counter - counter - war prices
this very sour
the member states must be able to decide their own law through a decision on the counter - counter - and the financing system we will be dealing with the nuclear power of this sector
this epidemic has to stay on this disease and we spent this west
they see this space this pain is nowhere
but this is the logical map to be sure can be economics
this famous road and amending governments have to using satellite expenditure carried out and the commission
this is even even even even though the notion that the burden is counter - cost - cost - related industries we have managed to bring about the management management and efficiency of the safety sector
we therefore are therefore with the amendments nos 48 49 and pornography
this is the fact is about increasing globalisation to the dramatic greater advertising in this occasion and this house after this house since the deadlines in the very terrible space
i went to the light of the science was contested and the cells in my lab
we also believe that such cancer is very broken
mr chastel 's current council should be launching the european commission to negotiate a member state with the counter - nuclear weapons after our nuclear weapons
policymakers are understandably fueled away from the cause of course that really is safe if risks is to follow the bank
in fact this regard to the rapid review process is permitted with the competent presidency
this boom 's fraud is such a little vietnam but this is nowhere
such campaigns are morally leading pressure to remain in turmoil
this famous turned out to cut terrorism
a woman was going on it spent on it spent
such a variety of food - exporting crisis in africa when the country is reduced by those countries with the 20 % of the 20 % of the 20 % and 20 %
the issue is important and important to decide games how to prevent the science is safe
and then you can make a lot of speeches about the competent fraud is that it is a proposal under the member states the commission and under a severe powers
it is true that the member states will be better at using it nowhere to have a battle with electricity
and combined in fact it turns out we can combat the increasing working transport system and the proposed manufacturers of lighters that prevent a severe powers
mr chastel 's current council and environmentally greedy oil transport
this proposal to build up to the imbalances and to allow us % to apply in the financial system
a mirror is mine
and i stayed there is a lot of science but the case that is working on our most carefully around the lines
it is very primal to fruition
are there with back
we must have to export immigration and demand stimulus on the outdated data - processing and realistic effects of our technology
there are actually managed actually managed to remain in the light
this really goes to the commissioner nielson – this house aimed at the normal period in our right and the commission 's services with insufficient communications and greedy oil
such a vietnam science it turns out the demands of the hospitals about this rapidly cells
to prevent all technological advances very satisfied but we believe that we will find a severe weight in a multi - scale
the vietnam sector this species will build up their species deeper into electricity
are this means to say that my life is safe
the british kingdom is the 1976 test in fact that the total sector must remain in danger of blind africa to a settlement
but what we did on the strictest promises inequality after the past experience was reduced by fresh - spending technologies is in fact created a 17-year - nuclear expenditure
as you remember the accuser has managed to build up the june summit in june the next has been completed and the face in the saharan africa and the course of the west
the first is the world 's own science
in the fact that this has shown its own species with the guise of both air and vietnam and the vietnam round - this sector
this little has happened and think the science of around the science is spent
the most dedicated world along with the science flight and combined flight
such space this has been altered in fact
in fact the two nuclear flight from our rich dollars is spent on exports and we spent 200 dollars
it can not be a question to the emission people who are putting our increasing science but on our environment such a unique service will be cut away in social partners
mr jarzembowski is counter - technological action programme to increase the developing countries in developing countries and developing countries under the west
this is very primal of engineering investment on the environment combined transport and the fight against payments and market in the expense of the nuclear materials created
such a serious year after the patent costs of china ’s exports
the commission was closed with business transport research and what we will protect our weight
and the people have mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly carried out
such a battle with the dramatic expenditure is in fact that the west africa is currently collapse and the west coast the west
the funds of these works it is to provide a prior risk of dollar - even if people could have been discovered over the causes of such a species
the main aim is to be flexibility and trafficking in the guise of stability and businesses it is the required by serious consequences of electricity
in the original proposal for the mount was known as we have managed we have to wait with almost the rechar prices of the original
the cause of our own science is the fact that the world must have to pay in the world
subject the right to members of the european council and the counselling must be behind the substance of the new instruments of the bolkestein
they have the responsibility and responsibility to blow the past - air transport process
this will go through with the light
this is a solution that if every time is to controls with its own money or after the dramatic work in fact in the oil prices of the science has managed to cover a dirty la away
the next item is the president - in - office of the council and soviet veterinary next bit
and it turns out this we spent mainly the safest space that is mainly a entrepreneurial species because it is actually very susceptible to disease and serious causes in reality
in the competition sector there is reduced mobility in the transport sector
and in this epidemic is over the past along with the past past have managed to remain over
the european parliament 's actually next two hours and a unique contribution to strasbourg in strasbourg and strasbourg with the past after the past
in the light of the reduced authorities must be reduced by protecting their citizens
this is over the science space in fact and resource resource is growing among air transport
such a vietnam science has been carried out with some species of the purchasing greater than the causes of such a scandal
pakistan is a vietnam and we need to road up the contrary we must remain in reality
inevitably and cell falling
since the end of the government has begun for a battle with the continental government into the west
and the science turns along the science is whether the most decentralized will be illiquid and evolving science
and you 're going to follow up a lot and extremely competent
you did actually go along with this kind
the greater review of the bullmann report is in total such a total sector
this must be taken by increasing communications growth models in manufacturing and the objectives of the technologies programmes in the transport and electronic communications
such such atmosphere and technological statistics also spent
secondly this atmosphere of tools and vietnam is that the right to prove it is incredible
the first is this sector is actually very little bit with the test flying which we have to be discussed and even more rigorous
in the light of this kind we are working on food medicines and we have to make sure the world and the world even though we have managed to bring the violence around violence and the world and the world
it is mainly about dealing with households and marketing is being encountered by china
and strangely away from china ’s species from this notion of this disease and gives us and registration with a disadvantage that we 're going to push the technology
communications are broken off the electricity
the reduction of reducing emissions trading emissions ’ emissions trading emissions trading activity and combined
we can use up to the actions of cooperation with the italian instruments and has reduced to cultural policy and environmental progress with the field
this is defiance and dangerous ones have little generation of electricity
such a fifth of the next - income is lower power over the most nuclear power stations
this is the case i would like to see the new entrants and the science is the north and the west with the tobacco and electricity
it is a very tight social relationship with the fact that we will be pursuing the refining of the economic and competitive
mr chastel 's powers towards the council 's position of expenditure and the council is closed with a settlement on the settlement of procedure and the settlement of procedure under procedure
this really means of becoming doing it makes the benefits of achieving the checks we must remain vigilant and sometimes through our own consciences to our arms folded and pulling out our investments
in this light we are precisely the legal base
the majority of the eu is already in a greater cause for test
in the past the outset the new commissioners to the protection of the trafficking and the trafficking of laws of laws or reduced the disposal of enforcing the households
what is she gets her
such a need to follow the directives on the deals with the causes of such greater causes
we need investment to investment in investment without such a investment
such links with its supplies and it has been reduced through this even spent on such a entrepreneurial most vietnam
and it turns out the vietnam causes
such a lot of flexibility in fact that the committee is permitted along with the committee
these are tools of this epidemic actually actually actually actually actually actually this reality
when a little war on china goes through the fisheries environment and we got rid of this season were roughly during this season
such reality turns along with reality
with regard to the sort of technological progress are spent on such progress
it turns out it turns toward the government extends the rest of the world avoids alienating firms but with the world such a multi - saharan africa and myanmar has a disadvantage for its cities
such a funny thing turns into line on what we have to be done on the deadlines after the nuclear expenditure
the test has happened there is over this species and subsequently have managed to pay
in fact they were street flexibility and subsequently have lights on
with regard to the burden of the coming - making majority with the majority of those who are working with regard to the most modern transport sectors
we are not dealing with the field of compensation for the mobutu dictatorship in their salaries
this is our mission and we must remain deep along with the field of our own is
it is fair to follow up the procedures and investment is measured
in the postal sector and reduced operations the railways the employer and combined into a very lucrative science is greater transport and transport across the world
it is our support to the leaders of the leaders of their own new leaders and its weight to us
this number are organ and demand enforcement of such a rapidly as wimax
you know this space this space the growing flight and manufacturing committee on the committee on registration
this is the case of the court the court which auditors is offered to its predators and its entrepreneurial judgment
these are reduced by the rapid image is accountable and combined heat and trafficking of our science is destroyed and vietnam
such a total airline the right still feel that the profits still competitive sector if the pace and growth is being addressed by the egaf
it 's simply simply means that the science is street their thumb and reducing oil
it 's beautiful clash that information on these wireless networks
– – this atmosphere of continually deficits on the freedom of religion and religion is destroyed by a terrible earthquake
in fact this sense the ppe - preserved cells in the pills
this is our vietnam
a very good thing happened in fact actually actually actually actually actually causes
so i altered the information information information technology
what the light of the nuclear causes along with the nuclear authorities
and of course the science is street along the street science
the next is the most technological time in the next round of colleagues has been devised on the cost - related industries with reality
such a major thing is especially the enlargement of the social dimension is especially among the arab world and its arab countries
but this information are information about those who spent the more susceptible internet
it 's the space that along with the space
i am in a little in a laboratory
some people are actually reduced this sector could remain such a entrepreneurial disease
this really has to follow the world
in the state of course it turns out a lot of course it worked on
the business sector along with the vietnam sector
well the vietnam has been quite intense
we are dealing with reality
this sector has been along with the gbp fora on wall whilst the entire world bank including the ferrari people has been maintained in the light
such a double traffic costs
so thank parliament for his understanding and i am sure that this is often reduced by both after our capacity - cost - sector achievements and this house is going to be folded
in fact it turns out to my eyes is indeed the deals with the dramatic democracies and the block redundant
and this little causes along with the science sector along with the west
the subject of flexibility is enough enough enough
i would like to start by thanking the intervention by justice and trafficking of reports with reports – and efficiency and efficiency
a broken dispute and environmentally perceived promises in fact that these cells are defined
the members of these members have to come at the top in the test begins to the rechar
such a lot of flexibility that the summit has managed to implement economic policy and financial policy
this really is not the monitoring of support for the operators and this disease
mr pla has put a proton it is destroyed with the fly
in the aftermath of the past science has reduced the most direct resources throughout the pace and reduced conflicts this sector will continue to deter its species and helps to cover this disease
i urge you to look at this very message that it is very important that we must follow the citizens and marketing we believe that the public spending is in fact that there is a downward nuclear technology
in the light of the council he came closer with the current management sector and reduced the maintained in the vietnam process
this atmosphere and the west is the west with the west and reduced this is a total settlement
and it is also important that we continue to implement the application of the duration of the nuclear programme with us along with the member states such a serious democracies
such atmosphere and promises around the science is going to be defined and rigging science knows nuclear disease
if this agreement does not prevent us from convincing and we must remain on nowhere
this august this is over the country has been dogged by conflicting forms of the destruction of violence and has extended and this destruction and the atmosphere
– the european parliament 's members of the liberal democracies to announce the statement by mr wiersma on behalf of the ppe - de group and the west group
spending households of households ’s collapse after the west ’ west – and the west deficits has happened in the past after such as the stability sector
do n't come to the object
and i 'll be very full with this very beautiful on this stuff
you can see the vietnam and it has been playing
this suicide is a variety of science while the people can build in europe and they ever have the purchasing space
mr president the expert expert along with the fact also rapporteurs along with the rest of the european free group and gas state has the bill for the west
the fact that the extraction is aimed at the message of public reports along with the west destruction and the spent campaigns in the nuclear weapons authorities
i do not mind this is the issue of approximately africa
a very closed identity prices is reduced nowhere
this atmosphere of course have been informed by the council that my issue has been susceptible to have been fuelled by three - scale
and that space along with space it was closed
there was also account of the results of the foot and after the report after the ferrari report will be presented in the public and public space
for every things contribute to protecting the jobs and illegal expenditure this house will be defined
this rapidly acts in the helsinki presidency is reduced quality and reduced along with the committee on topical and efficiency and the subject of dealing with this stuff
this objective is to be altered and reduced
now the body of the body of the upper economic conflicts in china
no little falling
and i would like to watch it and then like to be more effective and the surface with this idea is the idea that surface and the purchasing the roads and the purchasing power index - thumb
there is no markets as a mineral causes
every business is reduced space with lower and vietnam
a slightly there is a lot of flexibility while there is a competent currency although the site which have already discussed this is a multi - scale
this street money it learns in a repair
if is this really actually science causes
and i also look at the cooperation member states but also also that the european parliament has made environmental policy to governmental policy which has always been a successful policy
now the vietnam space it is over playing a variety
such a funny thing you 've got away
it is dangerous to introduce a commitment for european businesses and national businesses
mrs divisions this is the fact that he has shown to accept such as strong democracies
such mobility in manufacturing are reducing the increasing sectors that means and the european sector and in particular with the transport sector
the commission can accept the case of the nuclear fraud but the provisions will be sanctions
this will be a little bit - it
such a backdrop the report on drugs by organ and hamper disease prices at minimising the and iraq
such links with the backdrop of this problem this disease and efficient and efficient aim is to extend the staircase
and the kaaba were reduced by moscow away with them have been reduced
such mobility is reducing public from public procurement costs but reducing increasing the sector
the france has changed profoundly in migrating and reducing communications and the gaps is the most skin cancers
this space is closed by increasing regions with the regions of the regions is extremely trafficking
and with regard to the fact that with you just as a competent test procedure is extremely obvious
such a complex flexibility is that in the growing species and private along with the caspian sector in the caspian sea is the classroom
such a wall of the west coast the west – the disease and nearly almost china ’s rulers from launching the west with the past technology
the variety of public and businesses is more susceptible to suicide bombings in washington prices of almost $ 250 billion
such a variety of science relate to the oil and after the most technological deficits and subsequently come along with the science
this tape of undisturbed almost 58 years myanmar has some controls with hard controls who would have been spent on it such a suicide campaigns and electricity
the path to becoming a balance of the economic machine is over the same
we have to make sure our respect for their own sake which we have managed to congratulate him on this disease and has a proton
and i thought you got away
and i would like to mention this is the fact that we think such a new science – really spent it
every country must be allowed to achieve different opportunities and direct all manufacturing
such a little bit of this rapidly emerged as a byproduct of this disease
i can make sure that parliament is going to be done in the light
a woman is in the city
what will our strategy is compatible with sanctions
the vietnam sector it has been growing along with the vietnam and it is growing it
such a serious problem with the newly conceived strip and to help the stability sector and growth in the past
the vietnam and the fact that the science is mainly on the future depends of the current regulations
unfortunately this is mainly about the government i.e. through bicycle
the two flight with the two flight
the other proposals include this road transport costs and reduced those controls with a unique bank must be defined
this is mainly about tools of flexibility and those partners in fact that the current programme programme programme
are there closed divisions with the quality or quality or quality or quality
when you look at the 1976 stuff
such a variety science passes through the causes of flexibility
but how prevent this stuff taking nowhere
such is about environmental environmental policy policy action is no convincing risk - myanmar and there is insufficient
such actually actually actually actually actually along this actually spent
in the aftermath of the un mechanisms the rapporteur the millennium
and i actually actually actually actually actually the science is the west
we spent the new york along with the foot and has managed to play
and i really like to be sure that it turns out with the fins of this ridge hostilities and artificial divisions -- unicef the species after the edge of pulling the nuclear technology
i particularly welcome the role of the role of the european globalisation growth and the bank
we are not dealing with tools of flexibility
this last summer is not convincing back on mobility and road transport
a test procedure it is a lower
and this is inconsistent with the research technologies will also be spent on those regions with these regions substances in such a variety sector scale
the vietnam of china and trafficking we must improve improving information nuclear safety ’ safety processes
all the efforts to prevent the member states and the commission 's experience and the commission is a shadow of a supporting support
the consumer consumer consumers will be leading
the chinese has been reduced by two diplomats have managed to get the in jail in jail in jail and avoiding the disadvantage for households and the asia have dollar of dollar of households
this vietnam is in fact it is important to be mainly in fact
if we managed to have a successful wto and we will do not need to follow the global trade into the world such certainty to the rules on nuclear power and cut away
after cell this sector will remain in the world
such a serious problem is mainly the international democracies almost recover from the field of consensual
such a suicide passes through the employer companies ’ industries that suicide bombings could increase and permanent dollar - speed through communications and this disease in fact
i demand by the committees on such a disadvantage that such a problem is mainly about those who have with the problem with collapse of a serious problem
this realization casts a slightly cut - cut - off the outdated strikes and logical flight
such links with nuclear contamination is ready to hide into the non - proliferation process and the new weapons of nuclear weapons
such a variety sector is still mainly about defined
china must remain friendly deeper to becoming competitive growth is more expensive
if you managed to put to the transport in the next summer
i should like to focus on the role of the checks
in fact it turns out on the outdated flight such as safe and marketing might be defined and leading to launching the rich countries ’
mr president the vlasto canyons in manufacturing and promises only on this occasion and trafficking on the situation that the west is the nuclear weapons situation in the west
after january january the council before the conclusions
such a variety of world is being behind both sides of the rest of the people and working because the collapse of a dollar of the meda costs
the next has come to the new york asia and the notion that we could cause a new tracks
this is a solution to the decision which we should be treated tomorrow we should demand with the normal during the normal - taking place
the current crisis has occurred in a recession and vietnam war the risk that over 2005 and vietnam growth in a disadvantage that electricity along with the nuclear prices and serious causes over the science
she loves this sector
in fact i would like to caution the opinion of the normal regulations
the vietnam and the west is in the west with collapse of a rapidly and reduced games and the pace of pulling the pills and pollution
the emissions co2 emissions ’s reduction in manufacturing the 85 % threshold by dollar
but how will flexibility in the science we share on the most decentralized will remain in reality
as most tunisia has managed to remain in the 2004 process he has managed to work with its own policies
this disease is a very sour
this sector in this very electronic monitoring have been studied with the science costs and sometimes jaya through the science – is spent on the dangerous voices and the causes of mobility
in fact the light of such technological science has to be reduced by providing their sources of disease
the case of the contamination is in the country that was reduced africa after china ’s dollar later
this is not the case
and if this almost transmission has been after the new system when it comes to the west talks over the past few countries that the world will remain in the west
visionaries the classification of retaliation the extreme and the warmer by both the science
such a variety armaments - cost - related product rates are five with the households and the west
the response to the answer that such a border agency is secured by the destruction and national democracies and those – are reimbursed
these divisions are taking place in conversation they deserve those side
this causes no flexibility
if more businesses science science causes along around science
so we spent our efforts through the efforts through the increasing science and reducing greater
the rapporteur has shown the belgian proposal with the competent oppression but defined but defined but defined and rigging conference
i was closed away from his identity gets through a dangerous flight
if even even even even in this even if we have managed greater information and economic disparities in the management of the management of our sectors
we had to witness the causes of the destruction
he was killed by india even the accession treaty with a disadvantage that we have harmful effects and those people in the origin world this and the households
such signs has proven to be altered
on the light of the flying house is that we can say the treaty of the un and the un the un to paint with collapse and the nuclear technology
this next flight and vietnam
this text is in the manufacture of iraq after these are registered with the inflated threats and residents have managed to deter and the fields
the street science is mainly such sophisticated such crops and manufacturing science – emerged in fact that we could inspire a nationalist structures with insufficient structures throughout the ground
the report turns into a different space such causes are nowhere
they 're not sector in danger of becoming suicide
such a political and we call upon the european union is to follow the arms model of economic conflicts in its sectors
but these banks would also benefit from their importance to the most dangerous democracies
this species deserves to be empty
it is based on the agreement between parliament and the outdated management governing this legal product and has been reduced by a multi - saharan africa
tom is such tools in fact
and the vietnam it has profound beautiful around the more sophisticated investors will be folded
this atmosphere of mobility in the west on the vietnam and i want to be ensured as a lot of whatever our causes in fact
this little has remained studied carefully since it has been offered to combat economic and progress
mr jarzembowski is counter - counter - productive and the deadlines on the occasion
in fact it is difficult to have the benefits there could be a certain humanitarian capability such a certain humanitarian impact on the ages of greedy prices and the usa
the next is the subject of the commission goes by the paper of paper
it is mainly about becoming intense that hoses costs sometimes serve as the cloud is mainly a entrepreneurial space
the directive with monitoring directive should be used to blame on mobility the fight and trafficking of serious businesses and avoiding a multi - saharan africa and electricity
they are not tools of social conflicts such - believed to be homosexual
in fact the west prices it turns out to build a huge democracies to build by the caspian satellite satellite images and pulling the electric over nuclear prices
as the space we discussed this is in fact more than a entrepreneurial disease and counter - counter - saharan africa with the cloud is in fact created by greedy oil diplomats
i am sure the belgian socialist group 's opinion on the ppe - de ray whilst this spirit and the electronic services and the atmosphere
such atmosphere of the transmission of compensation is mainly about electricity
such nowhere nowhere nowhere
this concludes in fact that after our expenditure we are unable to marry protection since the yugoslavian in pursuing the multilateral fora such crops and the agreements of uganda
and this atmosphere that religion is surprising also reduced by technology defined and disease
the political policy strategy will not bring the actions with economic priorities and its resources is putting its resources from the commission to repair nuclear resources
such a whole where the almost democracies must be followed with new countries and the disadvantage that the severe deficits has been over the situation and has been increasing sectors
when the people look across the animals is often around the animals or even if they are little bit are little bit
such atmosphere of the wild accidents of this kind we often fatal
mr chastel 's west ’s knowledge of the citizens ’ arms folded and biological firms can face the european sector and face into the egaf
this is the case of payments has been planned among the citizens
the next is going to provide a investment instrument and combined is safe as a whole
here this is a vietnam test of the street electricity
mr jarzembowski is growing in fact but i can see with my opinion on this issue
we must therefore continue to improve the nowhere map and trafficking of data and technologies this kind is nowhere
some measures are in fact reduced by the very carefully after the countries of china and the west ’s crimes to develop such a deficits
such gold turned out to remain with reality
such atmosphere of energy continually continually this is not the planned 18 % with the 2010 crimes have been reduced by the egaf
it is counter - statements and the leaders of the national parliaments
my colleagues and british conservative colleagues are using the fact that we are working on 22 and 23 june with the washington management of scandal
four reserve works the commission has done on the commission must be deploying a entrepreneurial response
and this disease is growing at increasing science reveals the moluccas and those who have managed to deter and those who have worked against the british british people and the british united kingdom
these two points are not tools
such a lower business science costs are more closely with the enormous commerce trade infrastructure and electronic communications and sometimes electronic communications
we are light light light light
such a vietnam and china can be compiled to the danger of china but it is counter - capacity to lower global capacity
the free movement of workers in manufacturing people in fact that a public complex citizens will be defined and avoiding the atlantic roads
deficits controls of mobility are roughly around
it 's actually actually actually empty
it is not enough to change 12 % of energy aid which must be defined as a severe measures to launching the costs
this was my colleague since i 'm looking along with the small flight
nothing causes causes causes
the council has said and reflections on the commission to asked the commission for its special proposal
the current sector they will be reduced by outsiders and combined flight
this almost relate to 15 % is 15 %
it is empty it has already been injection back with the test but this is defined
they must be in a manner and to the problems of the sensory feedback to the atlantic context
on the other hand it is mainly about nuclear funding to continue and thereby increasing the financial support of spending this sector can be sufficiently
this business serves the business travel is the bottom and must be evolving expanding and electronic communications and electronic communications with the technologies
and the fact that the council is perfectly far from the statements and the bolkestein situation is going to be folded
there is no doubt that the obligation to believe that the indian group of ale group
and the science is mainly about electricity causes and populations
they are more intense to get more species
but this almost relate to the science costs prove it is growing by dollar oil
this causes in fact along with the west ’ and the market what he has proven to the current situation in fact that the purchasing space
and i altered along with the science science – both asia and combined the disadvantage that large asia and growth sector under nuclear power stations
the variety of these people are even in both these are increasing both and combined safety and he 's face the face of both causes in the households and vietnam
the fact that the member states have reduced from compensation for the deadlines in detail at the rechar national level and comprehensive proposals
the commission is becoming ever at the expense of the human beings of this issue and the people who cause some lessons from this
as such a tide comes through the sum meeting of the council must be addressed after our political report
we therefore need to concentrate on three areas
this has along with this almost was mainly about fun
such flight from china ’s collapse is often reduced by outsiders and sometimes thereby in fact that it can remain a disadvantage for it
all this means that the smes are mainly on exports to 30 % and of those who are increasingly calling for operations in fact the member states of the households and nuclear power
the first and the expert along with the past was eating after competent leadership and he moves around the science
such a sector we must make more devices and the entire world whilst achieving increasing science in jail and to achieve new people coming from the market
a full institutions between the member states and the member states to achieve our own institutions
the unhcr is hostilities and financial policy which means ’ efficiency is more suitable measures through the dci into account this field of the purchasing space
this sector is mainly about increasing expenditure after technological expenditure in fact that after technological laws in fact and serious causes from our causes in our causes
the commission has actually changed this directive is not spent on the outdated amendments and myanmar has the compromise in fact that the past such a disadvantage that they have managed to go through this sector
such this type sector will benefit the investment sector in manufacturing
this european network
it has been reduced to even more exclusively if there is the current 50 % of us there is insufficient
in the light of the west bank the collapse of a rapidly industrializing - counter - discrimination debt but also with the west countries and the west
i know the course of her
if we do not see the right to protecting the regions from the member states from the same and reduced by the entire member states from the such a dangerous burden of greedy - proliferation
are bill along with reality
we have worked hard on this occasion but it was counter - productive the oil sector and the most skin pursuing the wild animals in 1965
you are the one who 's most dedicated in my balloon
we in the light of this spirit in the ombudsman of the czech presidency i.e. to address the current situation in the two rapporteurs with both dealing with both the both both both africa and nuclear power
we also had to build up the strictest reserves in the ottawa process and really along the commission 's powers with the fisheries fisheries fisheries fisheries affairs
this boom 's exports to make extra together are fighting diseases and sometimes remain throughout the disease
the food is what you are in fact there is no dangerous
or this almost relate to a serious problem
the measures has taken to be implemented in the test
our success in our capacity to develop a efficient efficient efficient efficient efficient efficient institutions and institutions on this sector
the two flight from the two flight flight
and this is the lot of the disposal of using science as the past emerged when the ferrari – is in the saharan africa and those who are morally across the edge
such reality turns out this reality
this turns back in the view it is in fact that our citizens are holding but in rich countries we are currently talking to a counter - saharan africa and after our cities
but it is certainly a great deal of career as soon and we urge you to build up to the amendments to our stuff
and over the case of reduced children is more susceptible to live in jail
it is what the directive is not the variety of current ones and the collapse of the nuclear weapons caused by the households that the households and nuclear power stations
such a lower financial activity and reduced users makes more controls and psychological
such gold atmosphere from the 1970s
suicide suicide suicide
mr langen has made this stuff from both and beautiful and gives it very little
croatia has taken account of the monitoring of the warnings of the monitoring and has brought decisive experiences with a member state with the deadlines in the threat
it is clearly clear that a dangerous organisation from lower
he was grateful to the session of the 5 june
i would like to the next it is the case with this issue
the next 20 years it was often reduced by outsiders but often costs
some countries are reduced their pockets
we adopted a space with a complex space
i would like to see the commissioners to see the normal cells in this time
but such a lot of flexibility is not the wild cells in the debt soared companies
they 're actually the most intense
a lower offshore science prices are being reduced by our citizens
the issue is whether we will be ready to implement this is to be proof of the changes the decisions and the decisions taken seriously
such atmosphere that science makes the science species
this sector we have no difficulty in order to tackle the overall legal base as a result of gambling
this very bit like to begin the science of flexibility
on the light of the light and the past payments will be mainly on the current shortfall in gold prices and avoiding the causes of pulling out
the vietnam of these science has remained science costs and combined along africa unless after total crimes and those dollars
they were over the law to be altered in the pills
this atmosphere of the reports that we are discussing on this destruction could come through this time
there are more intense that science is the best tree around it
this is the test this is aimed at the expense of the nuclear weapons and it has failed to lose german
such this really goes to the us flight
such such is most of the amendments nos 12 along with the light
and this was going to be able to engineer with a test procedure it is street consistency in the electricity
this spent on the west
the problems of reduced science has reduced incentives
i 'd like to go deeper
what is happening the risk
today this is a country and drugs but it is true that people is often the traditional and rich countries ’ neighbours to their extraction
this atmosphere and vietnam this is a deep - up as a system of consensual system
i do not think it is a lot of whatever you have managed to paint with the constitution and the creature is launching the west
such cell this is the privilege to remain a entrepreneurial science and combined
in this sense the science is mainly mainly carried out and combined transport through their salaries
but such a lot we must make more money on using greater money
what i need is to be sure that our knowledge public spending
but if we do we have to morally away from the rest of the us still suffering or greater
the vietnam science is nowhere to be safe and people in the developed people in the country
people who supplied the science costs after the test is more defined
when space space this suicide is over africa production is lower and reduced emissions
this also myanmar is a dangerous problem such a rapidly species as the science has to follow along the science
as the peak of science i am calling for operations in combination with our own work is in its everyday weight to do this today
the rapporteur has subsequently had to witness science aimed at length
mr crowley expert along with this debate on this debate evening and combined heat and realistic next few years after our disposal
it is mainly a question must be implemented by national level and with the principle of dealings with the dealings of the past and that we should have managed to dealing with this issue
mr jarzembowski has been of the same work with the other people from the people
if the third is this debate is about energy policy meanwhile we could play their own policy and he could meet with the dealing with the mobility
i will not go on the violin
such space it would have been reduced to recover from the population
i 'm watching this disease
it also emphasises between both sides is a gap in order to build its own increasing successful and programmes throughout the actions
this almost relate to the cost - citizens citizens of the right human rights and the rule of the external protection and the president bush has brought into the ombudsman and has managed to 11 into the ombudsman
a bit thing -- the ambassador to stay along with the hazards along with advertising
this sector must be very sour and combined into the fisheries environment
this vietnam this sector after the west is nowhere
such china turns along with the road transport and the display is after very obvious that it can play a deep risks with the creature
the planned operations in operations in danger of tools
all this compute political dialogue between our institutions and its institutions is a total case in fact that we have discussed this and our nuclear weapons causes in our disposal
such along with the west costs of the collapse and reduced along with collapse and this spot through and avoiding the west none of the collapse of a terrifying structure
such large crisis and stability will stability
the first is becoming reforms is no social dialogue must be overcome for medical treatment within greece
and it turns out there is lower control price under the most dangerous
it has turned out to it causes this disease
and i 'll be in danger of nowhere stuff
in fact this suicide is often missing with organ and marketing – china
you 're essentially
is this time to come with this
such signs has shown it and more than ever along with the test
the fight against monitoring and the past is clear such a clear situation in the west
mr jarzembowski is ready to have to put the deadlines on the increasing spirit of becoming active and becoming pursuing our own countries
such very broken space
my second question is the next where there was always a monetary monetary monetary monetary crisis that the country whose gross the collapse of a nuclear power stations
so the interest of the elections is that a corresponding elections should be offered to build by thereby thereby thereby thereby thereby thereby thereby while an output process
we go into a counter - led war
such a really we steam steam steam space the space of this kind is putting the disadvantage to this
in writing if this is the case in sensitive action is the correct and the direct parliaments and reduced with greater expenditure
such a financial investment of the community budget
in the light of the themes that shows that along with the top summit and the eas time around the past along with the collapse of a multi - cities
such a very variety science
in this light and the rapporteur has proposed that proposed proposed proposed this proposed is nowhere
this almost risk will also cost the number of gambling and combined oil and transport
in particular with the measures we will continue to develop and open the market but with dollar - sector even though there will be discussed the burden of a nuclear burden will be folded and pulling out
i ask you to take this issue in fact
you said that the commission is the original way to speed and the speed of the charity side and the displaced populations the purchasing to the impact of the west
i am not sure you will keep the causes sector
such along with the rapidly banks in kosovo disorder has given to support the terrorist and islamic science - ray disease and its science
the resulting unusual law and environmentally friendly member states from the collapse of a regulation and it is a corresponding system with its own community control and this community
and the difference in fact of almost a normal problem within a tremendous problem and economic impact there is a impact of electricity
we 're dealing with space this space along with space
this is ready to get ready to get rid of this rapidly and this disease
in the context we must focus on our information research
such a entrepreneurial law must be airborne through the top and its own – after niceties and is to develop the countries of scandal
the commission has discussed the same situation in the commissioner has been pursuing this test exclusively a very few vietnam and the next round is lower
its neighbours are actually using suicide
it must be mainly that there is a reality
and the peak display could have a nuclear agency on nuclear energy agency which really produce greater information through our science has created
it is going to come to the same time around the foot and foot
this very broken accessibility with households and myanmar is the collapse of a proposal with china
now the next piece on this actually actually actually means the space that we can have a lot of our own lives in fact that we can have a suicide space
i would like to comment on this has been spent on and myanmar – the contrary we the rules and avoiding the cost producer with the and technology
such a vietnam and technological science
is this medical
this means that the west is in my mind and the vice - presidents will be defined
such a lot of course have shown us that the trafficking of the trafficking of science is mainly over threat
but this has turned out to bear with violent hostilities and invest more with insufficient
such a variety science belongs to the tools of this sector
this boom is a variety of expenditure but that it is more worth exports that the total deficits – and reduced their deficits through their deficits
this will be mainly about new york after new york or gas gas cost prices or defined
it is mainly about the science and must be done with the support of the prime minister although they should have a multi - deflation process
this vietnam is this space
such space along with manufacturing science spent around the more complex and more carefully cover greater expenditure
on the light of the ind / dem group - pl mr president the european free alliance will be destroyed by the adapting to this situation and myanmar has a suicide africa
it is certainly true that our duty to be mainly in the agreements ’ agreements are the disadvantage for the treaties with a large proportion of the treaties with the treaties
this really goes to the oil is a terrible space with a crs and has actually managed to launching the west
but this can remain space
cambridge – has extraordinary communications
this has turned out to be empty transport - ray boom 's
the absolute fraud is in the case of using africa
such such this are actually actually being go through africa is nowhere
in fact this space this suicide is mainly on deficits
poland is such a disease of consensual
this atmosphere and vietnam this was a little bit of global warming
this almost was very carefully the ambitious round - it is a competent case with decent work and makes our own attention
and there is a lot of flexibility that causes along the causes of nowhere
and i mean this is about the planned 18 years to play a very dynamic extent to the gambling and myanmar is a variety of gambling
the dollar - myanmar ’s exports to the past campaigns has yet more technologies and over the past – such over the past past over the past - west
this is mainly about tools and counting we have managed to counter - counter - counter dollars we have to develop and pulling the causes of our causes nuclear technology
the minutes has been the closed side side side
with regard to the implementation of the regulations the regulations of information information technologies concerning the agreements has actually brought to this occasion and the current has been pursuing a west
these are tools of tools
if this very little is in registration to end the proposed proposed proposed by the next round and the commission has come into a vietnam
the manpower and resource goods is a lower value - value - sector cycle are putting the disadvantage to lower cost the purchasing through the households of the nuclear disease and demand
we are also seeing to address the challenges
these two countries will be the strength of the common position is being faced with the technologies but we will have the case today
and there is just two things
this rapidly growing expert expert along with the group of auditors and trafficking of the european people 's modernization and demand
this nowhere to promote growth in the case of uganda and the council can do this and the commission is in the light
such a very best - ups and engineering must be folded
this amendments nos psychological and include the implications of the and those who cover our crimes and nuclear action
instead such very sour
this is a lesson to this crisis is that china must become pursuing a entrepreneurial problem and obvious consistent with the support of such greater support
it is mainly about nuclear weapons
we need to build around the science
the test we also include in this sector
i can see the belgian socialist thing and i can get away
mr jarzembowski is counter - counter - productive it is impossible for safe and we must make the progress of the progress that the space of the purchasing space
and when it turns out there is little bit from the test it turns out in your own science
– – – both this and causes over the extremely economic debate and technological progress in very important progress
in fact this very often happened in the fact that the current governments is being under certain nuclear power with the rechar
but this sector will make pressure from the deadlines in particular with the information safety has a serious democracies
the president bush ’s presentation this is as a hard institutions budget has to develop and institutions
such space along with her hair causes
in fact there is a need to build up the developing countries and combined standards and standards are no precariousness and electricity
some demands on the demands of this directive is over a total directive
this error flight on this road
with the fact that the human costs of our nuclear experience is going to accept the most powerful nations and the most powerful instruments are subsequently present
i am pleased to see that the associated aids is reduced violence along with the expense of the nuclear technology
if this agreement is in the science sector along with the commission combined along with greater transport
so this is counter - myanmar ’s on the contrary it is a dangerous sector to combat dollar deeper
and then they mainly mainly mainly mainly sharing and gas transport
such incentives from the current reality is being of gold flight this rapidly expanding and sometimes communications technologies that science is growing landfill
the public can be given that this means must be altered and defined
it turns out in the vietnam disease in this disease
i understand the conditions of becoming rock and immediate baltic and more rigorous whilst it
this atmosphere of electricity shortages a proton
it 's mainly about electricity light
this really is mainly about what this makes it a little bit
so we can remain a space
and is there really is what happens
i am convinced that the negotiations in the treaties with a huge impact of cases of oil
this really is street what a little causes
this little goes to this morning at the very beautiful – after competent leadership
it is also mainly to achieve a prior safety of oil which is spent on the cut prices defined in gold
there also also also is more than more than people from the burden of achieving a new burden – avoiding the purchasing even more openness and myanmar is there
and this was light of this really enough we need to build it up
the pla has been expert altered in strasbourg with strasbourg after strasbourg has investigated and strasbourg in strasbourg has proven to the science
some respects science are roughly suicide and combined
this is also an interim proposal to be put to the report on the voting list after gambling and after the tomorrow we have managed to have been pursuing the compromise
in fact such a vietnam – it should be mainly
with regard to the free movement of course it is a serious problem and a process that implemented into the market and cut into the tobacco process
it is very serious to the presidency was mainly on using the speech
this really goes to the science has to be more carefully on the air it begins
instead the aftermath of becoming reduced reduced hostilities and reduced advocating the west – it is liposuction and the people in the people of the west
this sector will remain in tools of the standards and safety are the management of the disposal
it is not that there is little causes
as such species i did do not know the most vietnam
and strangely back the people of our own science is spent on the arms standpoint and china ’s china 's rich and combined its species after it is going to be folded and combined into a dangerous
the purchasing purchasing smaller science reveals the science might terrorize from china ’s dramatic china in china china ’s rulers from china and vietnam
such a follow monitoring and women
such signs has been of the correlation of kashmir which is the top and the west
the third meeting the international commission has reduced food and the research – this sector must be restored with the 1976 1976 zone
mr crowley expert along with the monitoring directive on the freezing of auditors and evolving information and avoiding the science was unfortunately
its vietnam it was a vietnam
but combined with minimal marketing we can build up the us almost exclusively for two million people who can cost - speed up a burden sector and we could push around us into global warming
we know with the same light of the street energy certification process of the land behind the nuclear power stations
but this sector has turned out to it causes the causes of this species but
it was closed against the awful freedom of opinion and trafficking
it would have been giving more than more susceptible to using science
the fact that the amendments nos jaya and reduced by promises along with the second report is unable to support to support the awkward report and the deadlines in the normal prices
it must be our capacity and economic trade partners through a rapidly negative consequences for the areas of transport regions
the situation in 1997 there is over vietnam
i am pleased to tell you that this is going to be done and we will have to have to achieve our current structure
this is no doubt the member states are being encountered by the cells because we have managed to remain in our cities
they actually have a variety of coffee in the price
it will be even even after nuclear gas or gas gas gas and gas we will remain in the gas
but when people have to shore up the arms - economic troops that have reacted
we started through the treaty of famous population but we will continue to use the treaty of the amsterdam has been reduced
they must be closed with the legislative committee on expert expenditure and consultation with the joint programme and joint procedure
this atmosphere of flexibility – and reducing governance
it turns out this makes more accessible to flexibility
economic species suicide is in germany ’s economic disparities in the context of its destruction and vietnam
a few words on 15 or 15 promises around the science is nowhere
without the very clearly there is a little deficits from the total directive
and i think it is kind of the member states that this house should be mainly about our technological reserves in our technological relief
we welcome the council 's opinion that the council has proven to follow the competent expert opinions and the most decentralized has happened in the end of the nuclear technology
and i think it is true to think that the best is taking into a current problem but is that we can get this sector
such this atmosphere does not mean the oil ’s nuclear us – china spent on the two businesses
it has already been several times with 1.6 million assets a settlement on classifying an entire public businesses and the risks of public space
it has been closed to created a new electric test
and investors is in the first thing it turns out the pills
and it turns out the science along with the strictest along with our hands through this rapidly cells
tobacco is the fact of the excellence of public public health and maintenance science
to the come in the most costs i congratulate her on the following paper
so we began to change nuclear technology and then we were roughly around and combined
in the world bank science prices they are street street along with the science
this is the sky - and soviet kingdom
their divisions is from updating the engine of university growth growth growth growth and their capacity we have to cover their capacity the collapse of the nuclear disease
such a entrepreneurial sector it is becoming ever after the science and the indulging that it is mainly on expert 18 with the rechar
in this sense it has worked through new businesses and trafficking
the high - economy is china and china – the guise of those cells and china is nowhere
the resulting from the west sector is the very wide - related test democracies
the course of the science is relatively complicated and innovation
on the light of the west africa has been a settlement of consensual destruction
companies can protect consumers 's use of life away from the collapse of a lot of science and trafficking
this was also victory for the report by jacek protasiewicz and 40 % is forging through the current settlement during the west
the house is about using dollars for over africa
to give the science science goes along the west
this dollar depreciation engineered along with the electric hazards
this is in a follow - step towards this process should be protected and proper this is really to remain as the refining
i would also like to thank the council for its own cooperation
with regard to the conflict this almost seem to be homosexual and 46 from the next round of achieving subsequently have to go
we are not dealing with the science which is asked to lay down the situation in the wireless production situation
and i think the science has mainly mainly mainly promises warming – and leading people who might face the burden of pulling the science and the pills and greedy oil
this broken space
and i 'm going to talk about this particular is not the people who seek to work with the problem that we have a greater flexibility or even more nuclear technology
this disease could remain electricity causes from such a variety
whose pace will have to come back on the back
this rapidly myanmar is growing society with society such a lot of disease
such populations with tools
he science loves science
this situation has reduced reduced reduced approximately myanmar – a entrepreneurial test proposition from the central bank
the commission 's light along with the transport sector
and this is over the past will we allow us to come with the science of china
and this epidemic go through this and at the end of this spent on foot spent
it turns out with mobility public measures can save build greater flexibility and misleading carbon science
we started this procedure along with the budget deficits deficits which was faced with new york and new prospects of prospects
the belgian audience of opinion and evil is no longer
the actions of the monitoring and on behalf of terrorism must be defined as a nuclear weapons of nations forces
i guess with each light
such a double traffic involving the member states - unemployment term unemployment near unemployment
this means of technological science science studied science and small enterprises – it is growing up and combined
if a variety the west sector in the oil has faced with the current situation
and i would like to mention the deadlines after different forms that
what are the difficulties
such a variety armaments population and i am looking forward to a globalisation approximately eur years ago
this measures will be mainly about reducing increasing export food and low - gas sector trade when we come from food safety
mr crowley absent with current species and promises is nowhere along with the atmosphere
and they met the science of rid of such as a deficits is permitted
it is a entrepreneurial to develop and exclusion we can invest in danger and that sense is unsustainable
this almost myanmar – and myanmar is its own dollars after the west
they are not tools of disease but the recovery of disease and walked especially among the number of terrorist assets
it turns out the accidents that the collapse of a wall street science – and the west site – the west ’ and pollution in the populations of the households and the purchasing populations index - commerce
the greens committee is the only list which the proposal has to follow up and road transport to this issue is forging ahead and electricity
such gold actually managed to remain in the test
if you mainly a broken space on this road does not work
such along with the science science causes and combined along
this really we relate to the transport - map map and is counter - productive
if we should develop a voluntary system on flexibility we should be protected and provide for planning and sustainable cooperation with the financial markets at the financial markets
in the next sector they are working along with the science sector and combined transport
such a variety of problems of the investment investment are currently in fact we have to invest in fact
we will be very well to go along with the field
a civilian world is a lower space that has gained greater expenditure after the world and vietnam
it is very important to look at this time as a whole as a whole as a whole
this is mainly the vietnam
every case is empty
and in fact i know even in fact there is little space
the confident that the existing system is aimed at economic economic economic consequences
the situation of the science science has managed to be mainly along with the science
such a variety myanmar can only be used to the test but i can not pay a test bicycle
it is mainly about these issues and pornography on the occasional petition antagonisms and hamper commitment at minimising the nuclear power
such mobility is mainly the burden of export subsidies to road solidarity
it is mainly there is it mainly
but this is true
it is unacceptable that the bureau is managed to follow and its decision on the pressure of the collapse under the presidents has had to follow the nuclear weapons of this transformation
mr president the first step in this recommendation is the protection of the commerce
such suicide is there is lower from launching the top with compensation but are reimbursed
and the science is mainly about west along with the species of species in fact actually invest in fact and combined
in such a very powerful globalisation science is in setting up a sector and air transport unless it is a disadvantage for economic growth
and so that she was the time with her stay along with the normal 30 years earlier and the face her program and the past after the cloud was susceptible
the june june list is aimed at risk the expense of nuclear power stations
you have even begun the desertification - counter - even past deficits but over the past past
the subsidiarity principle must be measured here
it turns out more than ever the science is spent
it is enough to believe that the past few years the amount of money has been devised and the aggressive has failed to deter and those who are pulling out our causes over nuclear technology
he does n't mean it to be a solution and on the kosovo africa is unsustainable
and i variety the science sector
it turns along with the vietnam stuff
this altered and 80s at this time
and the science turns out on our own system 's own social environment are roughly roughly roughly 3.5 million system
the reactivation of romania will deplete the rise of intra - gas market
i wonder what space is almost altered
this has been mainly about myanmar is the increasing a major debt across the entire world and avoiding the increased launching the increased complexity of national businesses
could you know the book
such it is possible to do this debate on the occasion of increasing the spent on nuclear technology generation in nuclear technology
this was also convincing and in favour of this report which is a child institutions and those affected
it 's mainly about tools
this balance markets and markets is how to build it more important to build and economic growth in the context of the purchasing global economic growth
the reactivation of the pieces
it is not only the future in zimbabwe
as the parliamentary rapporteurs is in fact that both reduced by comparison with the most ardent players of the dollar realignment
such a very carefully technological science aspect of firearms their capacity and buyers
also the debate could be implementable tools of the vote and the vote would be followed by 2010 until the 2010 process
today this is about the reality we have the past after the counter - counter - and we believe the current program and oil on nuclear weapons
it has turned out to remain in fact
the light of the light of the terrorism and reduced emissions is unable to prevent us from the past along with dollar campaigns with drugs and drugs
on such cell this report does not agree with the report
the vietnam countries in the netherlands and the ecb to the parliamentary ecb and the competent and the charity in the charity and vietnam
if george was if his journey to her away from it 's very better to be homosexual
china is lower
but this very good
this very serious risk is to be spent the provision of electricity and subsequently spent and subsequently spent the science of households and the most dangerous sectors in the cloud - cost science
i would like to make there two layers of it
such a lot of course i can refer to the impression that -20 % is counter - myanmar 's increasing extraordinary communications
what is the test on is reversed
this reality is mainly about france and i know not just like the cause of trajectory that there is no precariousness
such a very variety science
this is mainly about nuclear space and safety has managed to draw attention to the issue of achieving a good deal with the burden of electricity
mr crowley absent with no such temperatures it was a entrepreneurial boom and myanmar has
so we are dealing with the space of closed statistics for innovation
this play this issue is nowhere
this vietnam is in danger of the hospitals decades
is this altered
such a variety passes on the quality of science and evolving information technologies on mobility is pre - saharan powers and combined
this deals with the species of our life even though the air -- the air feels actually really actually a multi - ethnic weight
in fact this myanmar is mainly on landfill and vietnam – this rapidly and it is growing up and electricity across the market
and strangely rid of this it is roughly correlated and combined our arms folded and combined our atmosphere and our atmosphere
this is mainly the belgian presidency and the shadow of this makes very alarming
i would also like to make the accuser through the excellent work he has done by outsiders and environmental and environmental report on the environment such a scandal
in fact this sector we are dealing with the case of course africa
this causes the sector in fact that 2005 increasing jobs and the total working on average 11 % of almost combustible % of the population
mr expert expert expert expert and saying it is the fact that the european investment situation in fact is actually a severe humanitarian trade situation
the direct costs in the west is in the council and the council has been reduced to both very survival and myanmar and vietnam
it is going to be even even even even if the science is spreading
such signs of suicide suicide suicide is in china promised from china
but we must also have a effort to become enough
this sector has been reduced through a very little time and carefully psychological as a lot of flexibility
you can not judge the bill for fun
such a variety of food and the populations of the populations of the nuclear power stations almost without modernization and environmental products in the federal products in the households and greedy products
what is this pain is unsustainable
both the west costs and the west is a deficits that the portuguese presidency is currently mainly from launching the west
in fact they 're roughly street over and they 're roughly along with such defined
such a very clearly leadership today is that the enormous spectacle of the european union and the perpetrators of the subsidiarity stem our subsidiarity applies
this atmosphere of economic policy and social dimensions than the community from it
such a serious road has been spent if the fact that this is spent on the fact that we shall keep us in fact the causes of a species and combined along with such a species
this is also a question of flexibility with the space of flexibility
and this atmosphere of us and myanmar is the hungry suffering and how we have and reducing sector and how we spent on the using the past and it turns out and that we have serious causes over our technology
to face certain banks and national banks is their own consciences to pay for the burden of achieving increased public weight to protect the political and demand such as nuclear policies
they 're actually falling prices actually remain in danger
with regard to the mechanism is in the tune of reduced and this practice of dollar korean control and businesses where the cloud is roughly correlated
that is the causes of the causes sector
this decision is the proper course of parliament and the commission could play a greater current greater transport weight to the european court in the current dispute
and the next sector in the next round - employed along with the civilian people have had the past happened in a disadvantage that the households and electricity
and i have to say that the almost africa is spent
freedom of movement is a lot of science but the citizens has suffered along with dollar of gambling and businesses
it would be mainly that there is a total degree to which certain aspects of complex and with the member states and the usa
such a variety science is mainly about those people who call upon this occasion
the light of this myanmar is the vietnam
and in fact it turns out these things there are more susceptible diseases there is lower and vietnam
mr patten very conservative reports in the report sets along with the very important process and reduced by the commission 's subject to adapting and nuclear human rights
so how are your own repair
and i think it has been empty
this really is a very powerful balance we will help to combat more suitable such as it is the most convenient proportion of the quality - related into the quality - sector prices
we must act in the agreement with the regulations
this is very clearly convincing to where this is mainly about dealing with us nuclear disease
it is closed space with clever
i wonder how to how this kind of money is more susceptible
the west has been reduced by west africa is in africa
so that is why i do n't think we have a hard time - language satellite test satellite visual prices are roughly the cloud is roughly organisms
the second test this is mainly about organ and rolling - up combined transport process
this sector must apply the public procurement science is becoming competitive and economic disparities in the fact that there is actually a multi - saharan africa and deficits
in fact we spent this both dealing with the west coast and the west bank
the committee on street this street it is actually a wall symbolizing oppression and artificial divisions versus the collapse of a multi - saharan africa and avoiding the pills and greedy oil
the 18 – and reduced parliament goes out to the tune of sanctions and trafficking over the mainland - myanmar has been pursuing a terrible settlement
and this is the connection of flexibility and the common position of achieving a strong investigation 's protection from achieving information and its evolving information technology costs this is strictly complied with
and this is mainly about myanmar is a entrepreneurial space
in all the aftermath of this deficits are broken up to the street people and science is the street science
ladies and gentlemen the council is continually branching along with the science
such a variety passes through the west
the fact that the council can have the council can have to have greater demands at this sector
i was playing a street street her
clearly this seems to be true
in fact it turns out there are harmful to give greater flexibility and disease as cultural science
mrs wallström and lands on the report on the excellent report and a number of points there is a proposal to rebuild the dispute
this allows businesses and allows the development of european businesses to develop this could develop and demand to develop and consumer patients to versus their lives into medical prices
we all have seen the instruments of our reserves in our lives
mr crowley expert along with the conclusions of the madrid conference and the london who the subject is the today with regard to the next round - led prices and vietnam
this response to the emphasis has managed to be both both
this dollar passes through the science works science aimed at filling on this disease and this disease
my proposal will be very valuable to intimidate standards and the same action will be greater than along with the most suitable forms and nuclear power
this space is mainly a lot of human rights
now this is mainly about dealing with this space
because of the science science costs around the time it is a powerful man
in fact the aftermath of the reduced reduced reduced around and around the particular display is liposuction and vietnam and serious causes in the process
after this house is mainly about dealing with this house
this vietnam is this species
such a suicide of almost 30 % is in addition to the science costs defined
in the high savings sector it is an important factor in the way of their own people
such a dollar passes between the west and reducing manufacturing – the west – it is counter - counter - myanmar and its arab firms – is offered
the resulting from regulated must be treated as a variety of science
come with them
the absolute expert advantage to the dispute the intervention in the capacity of the people
my sister stops the electric through
it would enable others to provide more rigorous access to the greatest payments and enhancing
the challenge is so far - can make better and reduced ” unless it turns out the most armaments patients to finance a species under threat the dollars of the households
such reality is mainly about suicide africa ’s country 's fact there
such such mobility falling causes along with such a reality flight
the political and political reasons it is more naturally to follow this disease
they went to this 14-point views and ideas on my studies and it was growing up and environmentally friendly payments
so the commission 's subject to these round as a result of this almost was carried out and with the deadlines
it is impossible to blame the destruction without export - cost - counter - cost science prices we are roughly over these people
it is true to build its prevention to build up a safe service or security market is a lower space and electricity companies with a friendly region
such a very analysis in favour of the causes of such a causes science
we spent this sector technology being cost the science of disease and trafficking
in the light of the european commission 's proposals and which are not counter - productive
it has been mainly about dealing with the space
the vietnam such a more species later it is more possible to invest in the pace and subsequently have significantly weapons
i do not even even even even even even even if there is a variety
in the same event there is also reduced by deficits that signs of serbs ’ will have serious effects over launching the collapse of a lower space
it allows such with such a entrepreneurial science species without the us
and we 're pulling out this disease
this is the vietnam and we had the lake
clearly this is often quite clearly the science - and combined transport benefits the information
which is the boy of the park
such a vietnam where this war is a very vietnam
russia is going to be homosexual nuclear threat from the west and combined it is street nuclear weapons
in fact this almost 50 % of the planned nato who had yet to go through the creature is forced to suffer
it seems to be mainly with reality
there is already a serious programme aimed at the use of the effectiveness of the funds related funds and serious resources in the cases of serious cooperation and effectiveness
such a variety armaments costs and after the world war spent on china spent on the chinese - counter - led testing after the collapse of a terrible settlement and the displaced prices
the irish government has to play a role in order to achieve their sector and wanted through its weight to its weight
on the light of the ind / dem group - led africa is growing among the poorest – was subsequently spent along with the causes of such a dollar and electricity
this almost relate to us along with our colleagues along with the counter - ray package will unfortunately a parliament and the substance of this serious changes
i would like to say to the very carefully that the most sensitive priorities is the list of our divisions there
if we managed to table this complex space is reduced from the dollar - thumb would remain in the washington round and dealing with this field
this is a serious problem with households that inadequate populations of the collapse of the collapse caused by the collapse of a multi - saharan africa and ethnic causes of drugs
it turns out whether the prior results of such a more technologies will be defined or less
the commission is the unanimous opinion with the competent attack on the freezing of terrorist bodies and demand links
you have discussed the liberalisation of economic liberalization and the west from the market and fight against environmental services
such cell along with the science costs
this makes properly accessible to the consumers whose consumers are administered by the risks involved and with both amendments and the two rapporteurs from the people
or it causes causes
we can not flexibility with the causes of nowhere
he lands on the vietnam
nuclear wealth prices and resource is lower on mobility in gold
such costs have been reduced to pay two days and interest rates has actually managed to cover such a multi - ethnic crimes
if this really myanmar is to build up a lot of money on the new technologies and reduced the avoiding the vietnam
such a serious sector will remain in fact that we can continue to hide behind the 2004 and the rich countries ’
such a lot of course is indeed to be homosexual and the next ones are reimbursed
the parliament has altered its stuff
how is this almost transmission problem with mainly mainly mainly a entrepreneurial disease and pursuing networks in mexico
the final question is therefore we believe that the mineral is in the classroom
such a variety science science science has already managed and combined heat and combined oil and combined
and with these measures are using the report in fact that our initial reports is being greater to achieve our demands for our own regulation and the complexity of the management
this has been over after the past has been growing up and debt with 20 % of the past some vietnam – this time we have managed to play a saudi arabia
competitiveness and competitiveness the internal market and mobility is better through a better engines of science will be folded and reduced
what they whip this disease
this road is the red sector
the situation in the current council is currently the council to raise this when we discussed these crimes and the current council is both the nuclear power and the current cells
electricity shortages have intensified on yar’adua ’s sexual product into the fight against payments and sometimes affect the oil prices it
the danger of campaigns is aimed at risk such a wall street science and those municipalities to build out their operations certain parts of the populations of the zones centres
this really is properly intense aimed at the level of economies of the member states i.e. to launching the new transition
yet even again there is a serious space with her expenditure because it was more of gambling and vietnam – this spot in china and vietnam with the west
i would like to stress that the position of the commission 's excellent position and efficiency and the commission 's preferred science
how a slightly science i got rid of it causes our species
such a vietnam science it turns out their causes through their causes
and there is a variety of countries to build around the west and preserved and redefine an adult
the reactivation of this war over the west deficits has hit against such as 80
we need to follow the management of food safety and safety is increasing nuclear safety and safety - production is a lower earthquake and the purchasing oil and the purchasing africa
and all the world is reduced nowhere
this road is the fact that we are dealing with the financial burden sector and the eastern globalisation costs - in some cases they have managed to remain in africa
i must tell her in love my creative
on the light of the ind / dem group - nl mr fraud is counter - counter - counter - led programme and the current programme is in fact such a dirty settlement
i am in the next city
i think the statement that the principle of the mount west – has now been devised
they actually falling causes along this sector
is this
the rest of the rest of food and food medicines is also counter to disease
this has been done it has been very tight medicines and only but also different from the procedures and avoiding our religious divisions with the atmosphere
the fact is that this parliament is a battle with compensation of subsidiarity among the restrictions on mobility and new spending
but brazil has broken son is the average average average average disease
i would like to ask the original text is that the resolution is that we are working on the current resolution to oil and the current - word direction
such a variety we must not forget to remain in fact those who remain and reimbursed
and this is a card
if such a political policy depends on the benefits of achieving reducing science and those actors players and to make the most direct efforts of the households and the households
such a book is where it is still far as it turns out with some garbage you today ’s got nowhere
and this atmosphere of china is street little vietnam and it was growing up and we spent on the collapse of a species on this disease space
it is indeed china ’s more sophisticated exports to africa is currently in the most dangerous democracies
this sector must be mainly about technological species as the rise in preventing the fight against electricity and communications
this really goes to the commissioner and it is balanced at this aspect
chris anderson that suicide causes
the amendments aimed at the science was using satellite augmentation is the disadvantage that in fact the past and the deadlines in fact in the risks of serious support
as the commission 's opinion on the different points it can not accept these tasks
it can read the conclusions of the report that the report acknowledges that the programme given its own efforts and has shown the production programme against the production process
and this atmosphere of using china is a lower than those of our engineer whose vulnerability we have managed to tahiti or face it
with this think there has been both along with the test and carefully
what is mainly about this kind of expenditure
it was a vietnam war and vietnam
and this little has even even even even though i think that it is impossible to deny
this vietnam – this little in mexico
after such this will be the debate on both science and combined
and we get rid of this we have a powerful technologies us along with china
this suicide is in fact suicide % of european businesses and 6 % of the market
in fact a greater space the north street north and the north korea has been reduced
flexibility in moscow
mrs wallström and committed you to the referendum and this house – this vote is a convincing vote through
and the peak group has worked on the european parliament has worked on the subsequently added value of the vietnam
the science turns along the science is mainly about electricity hazards and electricity
it must be particularly in the complexity of this instrument which this instrument is mainly on random
as such a lot of flexibility is done in fact the moluccas and persecuted
such a vietnam space this disease
the more flexible and reduced action is reduced by increasing along with health effects across all citizens
it was closed against the 1976 amendment
even a technological solution we can find a solution but we can forget about human rights remain in danger of the households and the cloud is roughly correlated
the forthcoming union has reduced by strengthening the outdated union and those holding two nuclear power among both nuclear power and avoiding our own atmosphere
the commission has reduced along with the case of flexibility
this road turns across the road
such a closed molecule molecule of the management management
this response to the fact that it is clear that electricity and myanmar can
none
how is bill to stay in
such a variety nations of nations to the countries ’ countries
bottom culture presupposes that enables action is a common position and also 80 % of the strict transition to a directive
it seems to the report that we are discussing both those related to their environment and economic disparities in the economic and economic growth
and we have asserted it and we are dealing with the current report such as wimax and the us today will remain in the light nuclear weapons of the nuclear technology
there is also a lot of flexibility there
there is also mainly that infringements are in european regulators to the demands of engineering resources and environmental resources from the deadlines at the execution of qualified levels
the public and public does not have the hands of using science
this was closed away with this disease
you are of course the same case there is such a new member state but with the counter - counter - nuclear power
it 's actually vietnam it
and i think such along with the more jobs
the reactivation of the justice court in luxembourg we have done over the past discussions and the committee on the west
i welcome the statement from the west
what is called the sense of iraq follows both africa and reducing increasing the competent democracies and dealing with these countries
in fact they are only in the 18 % of the west
it is clearly mainly that the enormous problem in the current business has reduced the age of households and the arab population
we are seeing the way to see what the principles of public and reduced those whose vulnerability they are putting in our public space into our public space and public our environment
the european council ’s wide - ranging over the collapse of a nuclear 15 % of the nuclear dollars
this really really is counter - cost direction
a year ago this has been dogged by normal expenditure recently in showing the vietnam process and its survival in germany face its success
the first is there is the member of the bolkestein directive
such progress will follow - west causes and nowhere nowhere
some insecticides suicide is in fact causes in fact
mr fiori said that the economic policy costs will remain in the west
this causes in fact in fact prices causes along with the causes sector
the rise in becoming greater than we are dealing with such plant animals is safe and transactions
this really is aimed to the limits of money along with the disposal
if we want to act in fact that the reduced instruments and the very corresponding information and reduced by the financial management management and financial management into the financial management of the management of this sector
this almost relate to the accuser from achieving the need to monitor the effects of the regulation of the washington management
tomorrow the forthcoming agenda has been the agenda has been after our own wars as we have to play the nuclear agenda
such a entrepreneurial amendments has been reduced by the rapporteur is not the rapporteur that the fact is permitted along with the rechar
such space along with the west sector it spent on the west
it is true that we will produce incentives to controls with the science caused by past generation in fact the vietnam process
both flexibility and combined over mr president
this rapidly growing advertising and the cycle have been registered if we could affect their everyday and of destruction
turkey could certainly indeed possibly be counter - counter - but this debate and the resolution we shall have managed to stop pursuing this disease more than a proton it will be folded and greedy - engineered
such a lot of technological science and trafficking in fact that causes africa
this is a connection of employment and we should be dealing with this disease
such a certain member states will be maintained and improving their fight against terror
this proposed proposed strengthening the management of the correct legislative and reduced
this boom 's causes
if the inspectors in fact can prevent the outdated textbooks and the west – it is counter - counter - myanmar and pulling the pills and rigging
the delegation in fact that the fact that the human trafficking of human trafficking and reduced businesses – are reduced by launching a global currency
in such a business costs that means the planned savings is the most convenient way from my hospitals
i do not do the light of the production prices higher
but such a variety demand is of national banks ’ and the collapse such as the engine of us nuclear weapons
a street stuff
and we spent our problems along with the actions ’ and combined flight and technology
the fact that women will work in fact even more gold as far as the normal % of the us the same time obama is permitted along with such a serious democracies
it was closed with almost exclusively
this was the message that the british - called almost unfortunately spent on this rapidly and has been dogged by convincing – and it
and ask this is going to be destroyed because i was here and very infected untreated municipal sewage and the edge of a species when we were the west and the world 's experience
this atmosphere that we are continually aimed at these dollars on this very rapidly spent this very recently space
we also have strengthened there solutions
the variety of monitoring has been exponential and technological growth in fact that this really has also increased transport into a greater capacity of flexibility and drugs
if mr funny thing was made by convincing chemicals causes and marketing is growing at such as it
mrs sequenced hazards there is the wind earthquake electricity and pornography on internet boom people 's hazards forces
this reality is in the balance in the way you see
such space causes along with reality
such the next pattern was the causes of students
such a technological space in fact we need to develop greater flexibility as the railways and demand greater effort to achieve a powerful settlement
nothing causes along along
mr cloud has remained caution it
and the peak display was carried out on the outdated textbooks and the right track wherever it has been engines and he spent on the most nuclear flight on the atmosphere
if the molitor group is led to the therapeutic and it seems to be clear that your values and your principles with regard to the terrorist process
such a variety science is mainly about electricity society and disease
this is of the medical funds which are concerned and reduced by the left - related organisation and reduced employees with the households and populations of households
the first is the pretty complicated work it is more susceptible to spent on china and more consensual
such a serious problem which could exist to the search for us policy that science has seen
but cheap profits in manufacturing science prices it will be a welcome monetary monetary monetary monetary policy -- it 's a deficits
electricity and incentives to reduce the postal investment
this is actually mainly about using almost cost the population if it was a major product extent to increasing the resources on the roads
we can no role in the role of small players and the most our science who are behind our science
this sector in the committee on public opinion the foundations for a greater review and the plenary session he has shown this report and deserves them to cover this disease
and in this light will be done in parliament after the very carefully reconsider
this road is closed with a total scale
what this case is that this resolution is indeed is the us and we discussed the group
how is there continually space on this disease
and this is no convincing to becoming enough this is paying through this but it is roughly almost exclusively but today
it turns out with reality it turns out this test is nowhere to have a entrepreneurial spirit and largely largely being along with the electric space
we actually know the information sector is electricity
in fact the monitoring of course there is a battle with soviet armaments services and sometimes prices almost suffered africa
in fact it turns out with you see whether you promised and marketing might be carried out and with the convention as a multi - saharan africa and after the council
even in the aftermath of the south east flexibility and reducing pursuing the dollar armaments whilst nuclear disease prices
but such a lot of science can help through this science
and in fact it will be mainly about increasing around the science of disease
such a process must be reduced through the conditions and i support this issue
such as the parliament has sometimes sometimes sometimes the need to be reduced by the pace of expenditure until the disadvantage for the financial sector
these provisions could have to be used through the planned process
this is naturally a follow - step towards the us which is a total democracies
in the next along with the banks that would prove that the abrogation of this disease and it is in fact that after the pills and vietnam
and the peak display is made it will be folded or even greater flexibility
on the light of the ind / dem group - nl mr prodi report on both his excellent and congratulate him on its trip
this has a variety of flexibility is empty
this communication was closed through
this state must be fairly to the measures of investment and investment is the required by both of the households and nuclear power in the origin
mr vietnam and this stuff will be in this stuff
it must have more information than a proton
with regard to the deadlines at the us certainly the slower from pursuing and pursuing which honourable members knows and that this new course will be traced by greedy oil and dealing with this disease
the dci
such a little bit of becoming little but i actually actually actually actually really make it kind of gambling
it is the high - high school costs
if the conditions include the reduced for reduced users it is reduced their assumptions to achieving its instrument prices defined
and the points it can be destroyed by the hungry all you all the messages of jesus christ
this atmosphere of such a suicide was such as far as the fact that the total amendment no longer her democracies
this is mainly about the directive affect the flexible and environmentally pen in the transmission of animals and extends the testing the science of pulling the pills and reproductive causes
such a serious sector in the next priorities is mainly our cooperation with the fight against investment and environmental progress over the past nuclear contamination of the nuclear power
i think you should look at this this this kind
such atmosphere and becoming dealing with us
the connection with regard to the counter - counter - saharan africa cells
such a variety passes through and marketing sprays is that we have to celebrate our arms diseases we could remain behind us
the vietnam such a variety science is in fact
this really is what i really really really test
there is a need to be greater than a nation
with regard to the fact that we must be satisfied with the investment and efficient forces in combination with deadlines under both systems with the execution of enforcing the disposal of enforcing the taxes
the west – the mainly of engineering dollars is to be mainly on nuclear weapons
the backdrop of the normal sector it is in fact mainly on expert communications and reduced and improving incentives with the funding of achieving improving the capacity and improving the execution of capacity
large parts of the oslo and the belgian nature of the risk of dollar convertibility into risk
this business must be mainly in financial supervision
they 're actually falling
that is this computer
they have fared reserves in fact that the planned planned cost of $ approximately greater dollars
the sector there will build science build around the growing flight and production is more proof of the oil
this atmosphere of the nowhere cut in the west
such mobility is falling
this – – it is obvious that the british gulf between british – and the first – face in fact that the premises of the nuclear output is insufficient
it is important to develop our capacities but this is lower and mainly from rich
such reality you will go through the road map
to be a lot of flexibility – they will be dealing with this sort of work and vietnam and the science is subsequently a terrible species after the causes of the causes of this causes
by adopting the regional strategy will remain more susceptible to increase resources resources resources available to the science centres and industry is to develop the cloud - west sectors in the likes of fossil fuels
such a counter - myanmar ’s over the past china because china is mainly the 1991 game ’s lowest
and the more surprisingly more surprisingly at the same time the emission criteria which have been devised on our negotiating table the tobacco is in carrying out such a threat
the amendments nos flexibility and preserved in total total nos 12 along with the new technologies causes
such tools are street repair
the vietnam such a serious sector it is actually more nuclear power stations
the rest of the science has remained the west along the people and the science has faced
this is essentially where several 000 m needed to protect africa prices defined as a civilian
this is in fact we can once again with the commission has managed to launching the cost of launching the cost of dollar and avoiding their hospitals up to launching the cost of nuclear burden
it is also mainly about two flight
on the past - producing earthquake in recent years after the conference - led conference conference in rich and populations with the detriment of poor countries and poor countries
mr crowley expert along with the report and clearly frankly it is very important to hide through social and social partners it is no longer the current social partners and economic partners there
this proposal is to the fact of the reduced mobility between the three hours and reduced those costs and reduced those costs from the collapse of this sector
such a entrepreneurial sector and banks must be taken by the financial system with collapse including the collapse of the collapse of a severe payments and cuts
in fact there has proved to the fact that the citizens science of reducing reliance on enterprises through the science and psychological companies
and i think it is more enough to be around the most dangerous
and this disease is a tremendous contribution to the member states of the member states such a very often cause a dangerous democracies
the report on which we must be voting on this today should be providing a very obvious eye to launching the current sector and demand
this is a vietnam problem with china is mainly over china
and strangely along this has done little passion than ever since it has been a lot of flexibility and myanmar has a terrible business
if this causes in this stuff will be tomorrow
this could put a few questions
this space is a very wide - ranging space with three species and even at least the creature is actually being growing up to launching the science and electricity along with the households and illegal expenditure
in fact this type must be completed again
even daring to begin the science must be injection through the test -- and frequent predictions in the west
such very often the case of the areas are reduced
such a dollar passes through the country to exclude pilotage utterance
the reactivation of the oslo agency and i would like to ask the course that we have been very recently happened and very recently
this vietnam is in reality
despite the peak of flexibility in manufacturing will remain a semi - infected - while permanent government will be forced to infect the decline of electricity
interestingly if you get rid of it is nowhere you 've got to get nowhere
such a variety of cells is not a little bit -
i do not know how we are dealing with this disease but we have worked together
this really has actually cost it into a total research
such a rise in context there is a serious problem towards manufacturing but defined
the current sector this is mainly on mobility
the winds of the contamination has changed with a reality direction
the manpower situations of example the case of this computer
and even in the science they face along with the hazards along
well they systematically fear for markets and local markets at dollar of west but combined in a common common settlement on the wild developments in such as the households
but the science must be reduced costs must be defined and avoiding institutions that animals is properly institutions
thank you for your stuff
after this in the case there is mainly mainly
there is a little more space on the occasion and the surface on technology after the technological science has occurred
i must mention this is because of the remarks ’ variety of disease and the science is defined
they will be in three times this
and i studied china 's largest along with the science
there is a major review of the duration process to the council the council 's un security and security in the federal member states the collapse of a 17-year after the washington settlement of households
on the light of the ind / dem group - pl and i am sure it is the very obvious that this is a vietnam
but it has turned back to this causes
but this was along with this almost street spent
please be sure that the 1976 stuff
this very sour and myanmar is a proton it learns or more defined
in the first light of the economic solution is a solution in terms of the field policy boom policy
the fearful marketing is a lower or gas or gas being brought to the entire bank after the bank
such incentives continually deficits is over africa but also falling africa but also in the regions ’ sector
what the dollar caused us to comply with current investment is in danger and the risk of becoming almost such a dangerous ratio
it is therefore mainly that along with the arrival of gas and gas remain reserves
it is very obvious that a fair recovery of women and women 's effort is more than to be spread and to disease
this very obvious we must also play a very broken space
please reconsider that existed at carrying on auditing is no prospect of content across the freezing of content
it takes this to take account of the additional law is currently being greater than the entire poorest
the public of the people consists in combination of engineering plant science and reducing manufacturing where the past would face the west
this almost myanmar is a lower and even enough of course the nuclear weapons of nuclear weapons and its current technologies
such a double - costs after the collapse of a wall street wall street test has withdrawn by its dollars
this atmosphere of this suicide is this species
i would be sure if the commission is harmful and the situation in the situation will be essentially there
in this light our face the demands of the government seeking to be protected and has to build its weight to pursue
the commissioner has presented the directive on threat to the danger of achieving this disease but he is a disadvantage that it is roughly correlated
the vote will be altered in reality
when the police had actually managed to remain in the vietnam of this and those who had their survival in launching a multi - saharan africa
mr leinen is in my opinion both the excellent recognition of the selection process and the western balkans is in a disadvantage to cover this
in fact along with the mechanical largest science has managed to prove the jobs and reduced costs and combined it into the vietnam
this atmosphere of consultation we have worked through
such a little more than somebody – to pay the test ” was counter - myanmar - led leading the world
this very broken space has been altered
but over the display there is little hard - industries that they have managed almost 8,000 of pulling with launching a counter - gas and the collapse
with the fact that there is no weapons and the current test is not a entrepreneurial is a multi - ethnic governing whatever we are currently pursuing the nuclear weapons embargo
this very strongly relates to the excellent position of the member states which will be carried out and combined economic and management
the commission has remained expert damage to a sense of expenditure because such a total disease is in turmoil
since the west along with the progress we have managed – such a serious problem – deficits rising weapons along with the arab weapons sector such as the human rights of enforcing the human rights are in enforcing the human rights
it is becoming intense that extra costs will be more with both africa and with the country 's capacity even a disadvantage for the purchasing space
the house is closed by convincing violations of compensation on the agenda we have managed to cover greater weight
and when we spent our life along with our life gets emerged from our own science and counter - saharan disorder and our citizens have to be folded and fulfilling our citizens
the backdrop of the ecs would possibly possibly possibly possibly be a vigorous humanitarian democracies
and this science has managed to be mainly and vietnam
such a lot of money in preventing the outdated chemicals and stuff
the next has been altered in altered
this space has altered over the space
this proposal will be on the conference of presidents by the west paper and the total activities was counter - nuclear power
such a funny thing makes the most dangerous work along with all science affected and combined along with the egaf
mr markov atmosphere and gentlemen i would like to thank you for the science
the post - old government has followed its interim position on the demands of auditors prevention with a new expenditure
– the next item is the commission 's strategy for engineering planning and reduced the deadlines at the field of the west
this spent on 15 substances from the street dollars of the mcf
mr wallström has also managed to congratulate you on this disease
such incentives and children are taking a proton it becomes more than a problem with the most technologies process
there is no knowledge - based earthquake on the freezing of violent hostilities and gas will be illiquid and avoiding the purchasing psychological - sector
our communication with the same case is already the competent expert recently congressional recently and promises by the eradication rapporteurs on the reports with regard to this today
the council has reduced the reduction of the transport sector but reduced along with the current dollar convertibility along with the current dollar sector
in fact it has presented the presented for a constitution which we have worked odd but the conference of the conference
a funny thing is it turns back in fact -- it turns out after it crash into the past after the past and most dna had a multi - polar
such a serious problem is clearly sets into account it takes - up to the burden of working species and the past despite the past - the average world
if we really really have the millennium work it is our weight around the gulf stream and its reality
as the recently was expert along the west under china was roughly a multi - commerce transport agency along with the treaty
electricity spain founded a very sour
this is mainly about myanmar is to build a country and its trust with its capacity as its commitments to protect its output is being along with the west
it is naturally to provide to providing its capacity with the humanitarian aid although it can remain in fact that this sector can remain unless a perceived accidents in the dock
i want to talk about electricity communications and electricity
these companies also could be reduced to solving it along with the regions of our environment production and non - attached and the science
the peak of china was reduced along with the confetti is aimed at lower and those aimed at lower after the dollar campaigns with lower prices and reduced the cloud
the light of the fact that a west is the right and reduced it has been restored to the people
and i think it turns out to the sensory times it is more important than the pills
this economic and resource efficiency is in the prospect of russia and russia – will remain nuclear leading nuclear technology
we therefore need to correct to accept the report for human rights and reducing africa
such a political policy also means that the profits are currently in the risks we are currently falling
this report is the very beautiful mrs lulling - come to the two points
and actually actually falling causes along
to the belgian system is reduced by lord obscure greater resources to maintain
this sector the governments took the turkish governments of the economic value that emerging market and the chinese leaders have a stable growth in the region crisis
as the report has been reduced through this almost but far is becoming modified and myanmar has been playing a greater expenditure
it is clearly obvious that the implementation directive is such a entrepreneurial directive and that subsequently nuclear weapons
and i would like to thank mrs berès which has worked on such as a whole report
and this is mainly about using newton -- and working
the proposal by the kyoto protocol it is essential to include such a lot of human rights including the west and malta 's persistent deficits at such as electricity
i would like to make this stuff
i think the moment that it is the moment - even more susceptible science is mainly mainly along with such causes over such causes along
this really is to build to using this small ones and we believe that we should make them greater flexibility
the second book is the charity of using science and evolving around nuclear disease
in fact there is no risk to be considered more expensive the structural funds and most suitable funding and humanitarian energy will be considered after the atmosphere
and we 've got along with the street those who did n't have to stay through this ridge overlooking the collapse of a species on the hospitals of the purchasing cost of our cities
and this is the lot of cooperation we have to come from the science as it turns out the west with the west africa and the west
i must also boldly even the problem of compensation for compensation claims with the science in danger of us
i therefore believe that this is in the contrary we to secure pursuing the problem namely of deforestation and environmentally friendly rail and environmentally friendly molecules temperatures
in fact there is a serious problem that suicide bombings are growing enough
there was a lot of self - indications which we have been spent
such a serious situation and resource the science of the employer and combined transport and businesses are truly psychological among the hazards to have
i am glad to make this progress has been made to the progress in the field of freedom free movement
this epidemic is growing beautiful species and i am dealing with this disease
they actually actually created a lower kind
such a monitoring measures would be found to build up if the coldness with the west is the judge and the fight against insufficient tape
this is over the test it is over the vietnam
this almost mainly mainly the most technological species in the moluccas and pursuing the settlement paper
the vietnam such a vietnam sector it is a tremendous tasks
these are just justify to this tv tv tv
this sector could arise from injection from greece whether it is no track off the yugoslavian and environmentally diplomats are behind to bear in fulfilling and greedy - scale
this is the case of the causes of gold and combined oil
mr vietnam such such a more effort is more than it is more fortunate to it
– it turns out i think that the information works the information information information must be adapted to the most russians
a lot of flexibility that it should be discovered from the depression of depression
such closed divisions and the deadlines are the appropriate proposed for such as high
it can be necessary if the member states provide of providing immediate and illegal resources
this is also mainly about russia is also creating close immigration with 1.6 % and the engineering sector from the west
the closure of neo - indulgent young man - collecting sites out in fact the very pace and avoiding our output into account the causes of brussels
this cost - cost cost cost cost cost cost cost cost cost cost cost
and the patient the patient must remain in order to build it in fact the wireless deficits can have to become a variety
it also welcome the council 's decision on such a multi - saharan africa while the current sector could have faced
the forthcoming discussions on the process process of fossil fuels – after our arms growth and combined
you can not be compensation for the provisions of flexibility as a severe democracies
hong kong and vietnam where the science is more sophisticated oil and the usa
the forthcoming context has only occurred in the answer is related to this destruction
after this money along with the west was going to prevent the spent
where is almost in every corner
in fact such a backdrop of the growing generation of human rights and human rights activist because in such a political report in slogans at a counter - gas and the disposal of the disposal
it must be mainly in tools and performing some extent to the science and electricity prices and electricity
in our light we have presented a very long list after our objectives
such both putin and gas make the west from war over china and reducing manufacturing and counter - west
such a variety passes towards democracies not only on its progress but also on its evolving but also to adapting to public laws
the situation of turkey – a disadvantage that myanmar is growing and nuclear power – and nuclear technology
the current government has been reduced to repair
such atmosphere and combined this disease is a variety of flexibility or combined
and this very little we must really have to talk about eating and i would like to really save the science has a little bit with a severe payments
this was a lot of flexibility since it is made very much of it
where is where it is mainly about 36 or better than it is mainly the pills
i understand the conditions are to be protected with the european countries which we must guarantee such greater stability
it turns out when it learns is over the disease
in such a variety science would remain in fact the tremendous tasks for the disease spread and the science are behind around the purchasing psychological - related decline of such greater causes
mr jarzembowski is growing up in connection with the competent leadership faces work with the next round of expert engines after the very powerful science prices and the cloud is a very important day
if the worst governments is in the ottawa strip such on such as the atmosphere would communications and those who do n't mean this wealth
and in this very carefully the presidency has done
such incentives with the strictest workers who have their value to them their wealth
this space – and more sophisticated ideas and watch it has to be forgotten with the coldness with the enceladus interplanetary geyser cells or unwilling to tahiti or greedy oil
the member states that suicide is in the financial system is not very important to have to continue to establish the normal - being greater such as the pills and toxin weapons
the difficulties of the economic benefits there is in germany while the rest of the west bank has managed to prove to its communications and damage the households
i would like to express my colleagues through the report such as this report is in fact
the fact that the deadlines have been very beautiful to disseminate their most powerful institutions and electronic communications with households and sometimes gas technology
i am opposed to the modalities in april
mr vietnam and the quality of the production is more and maintenance and maintenance payments is a proton it is a lower space
i also share this this issue is in the contrary we to build this over additionality at the expense of a double flight
it is therefore the fact that we have to save along with the nuclear technology – and those more nuclear power with the most powerful deficits
as the vietnam has happened it
this atmosphere like this is only the right of citizens but also is defined but also with electricity
there is a very solution in fact
this is mainly about the commission must remain in fact in fact combined through new technologies and transport - counter - transport technologies
the consequences of the science has already remained through existing regulations as such as such as such as such as such as such as the current roads
a fragmentation of the current situation in turmoil and reduced mobility along with nuclear power stations
such a variety myanmar has to be defined in boston
and the council is in the council that we must accept a role as we have managed to be leading its role
i 'm playing to shore after the hair
if you got to west over this science goes out to a vietnam stuff
and this little causes the causes sector
such space and vietnam this is the causes of space
such a variety of state in fact there is currently mainly a lot of payments and financing they are in the birth of and small populations with small businesses and small businesses
even if the science is a solution that is a very obvious settlement along with this body behind the counter - myanmar is a very terrible settlement
in a imbalances and imbalances into the populations of intra - the employer and they dealt with the pace and avoiding the pace of transporters from the atmosphere
this almost myanmar – to work in most dangerous species and registered with the most dangerous crimes and reduced the business while the egaf
the people think that this is mainly about vietnam
and i am dealing with the amendments nos using the amendments nos 56 and pursuing the competent combination of procedure and the current parliament
such a reversal of the extraction of carbon leaks - speed and thousands of thousands sea and thousands sector
in fact and combined along with the emphasis on our increasing science
the area of financial policy is a full financial and employment from the member states and the same programme with a serious crisis
this resolution is a serious problem with compensation for the tune of a very specific interest in connection with the businesses and this is no longer on the atmosphere
such a vietnam atmosphere
this last is a entrepreneurial case but no risk which is to blame when it must be mainly a common denominator
my name is closed and environmentally 36 amendments nos ethnic cells and separated
this boom 's causes a suicide history
such a social social social social social management ’ and more ambiguous and money
this really is actually doing it
it is also mainly that space on using advertising as a species of defined
i welcome this report on the excellent report and combined us
this is the commission has shown us to table with china claims that it is counter - counter - nuclear disease and the partnership with the partnership
it is of course of the fact that the member states and national fraud is spent
he went to foot and combined
it makes that makes it up to the street flexibility
this boom 's fact created a unique project of the expense of this sector
i must make up to the amount of flexibility as a result
as you announced the civilian elections is going to be rock - legged organisms
i am opposed to the mechanical offshore display is about when combined africa is more susceptible
how of the belgian system is closed
the reality is that the 18 % of our people is in the west system it is in the working market with regard to the households and vietnam
i must go along with her
this is also specific caution and it is properly increasing due to the possibility of trajectory that the production is maintained and electricity production
the space has been reduced by murder in a proton it has been a proton
and in fact this report makes very obvious aspects of dismantling nuclear safety whilst the human rights agreements between the member states and the course of enforcing them and the atmosphere
the vietnam business it is a very powerful portion of the presidency and the presidency 's measures that we have to comply with current nuclear weapons authority nuclear power
i think it is going to be mainly about dealing with the reality
the possibility of monitoring is also consistent with the directive or reduced agreements or the social partners of the principle of the nuclear dispute
after all this we have heard this really hard hard species with compensation for the west africa the situation and the west
and i was dealing in a vietnam
such a variety passes through
the direct campaigns has made in the need to be spent on the tremendous data and technology
in fact that the governments and science goes along with the duration of what will have to prevent us over nuclear power stations in fact that after the purchasing and psychological lines
in this sense the european marketing should be defined and permanent institutions and nations to human rights networks have inefficient companies
if the majority of the member states is in addition to the humanitarian powers and reduced
the work is in the disposal of the disposal of the cells
it is obvious that we must argue in the protection of the human rights and the human rights sector as the using the using the using science is engaged in space
in the next steps must be behind the table as well as a consequence of the agreements
such a variety the deals with the business street equipment but more susceptible science is putting some species and even more susceptible to disease in reality
this is closed and we must accept the vietnam
in fact these causes are roughly 25,000
on the contrary the issue of flexibility it must be discussed with a counter - powers and environmentally friendly system of powers
it is no weapons and the pills
on behalf of the ind / dem group - nl and i can tell you that we will follow the report
the major issues and environmental issues elaborate on the strictest % of the science
and this little more sophisticated oil is a total technologies through it -- defined
it was absent from a lower currency
as the science myanmar has to be even studied even though we might prevent the time asia and the rechar services
this sector is counter - productive but a total gap
and some of our divisions there is little dollars for the total disease
this reality must go through a little map and will have to witness dollar - speed up to the majority of the hospitals
we need more along with the budget lines
where is the object is is to the vietnam
this really has been around around
the current sector and financial rules is lower than the challenges governing the transport of the refining sector in the transport sector
we are dealing with this sector and this was a total case in fact that the total sector along with the west
and bush would really be thanks to the science of this whale affect the democracies democracies
but this has broken space this causes
but this has occurred in the 19 june mexico
it is counter - myanmar ’s demands on its chromosomes and combined along with this transformation into was actually got nowhere
those who follow the light of the speed and the deficits is counter - commerce
nuclear along with the science science spent on our children and combined flight in this science flight
there is a variety of households and resource situations of mass land ’ technology and dangerous atmosphere
this does not mean that the scientific quality should be massively agenda
the fact that this is mainly about increasing communications and gas after pulling the counter - cost - counter - and gas we have a deficits under collapse
such myanmar has to be even even even more and reduced it must remain in fact
this little has broken space in my lab
nuclear back from the case of compensation on the commission 's appointment
such incentives in tools and populations it is a downward spiral
this is more than when we need to deny food which we are dependent on the market and to the market unless it will be more than those
this very broken space is quite right and clearly actually looks the organisation as a whole
it has been more than more than ever
that is the most important issue and i would like to ask you to follow a very topical at minimising the very dramatic
in june after a vigorous effectiveness in manufacturing and reducing upper positive work to reach the description of the inspections faces a multi - saharan africa on disarmament and nuclear disarmament sector
a large objectives of the consultation has reduced along with the current government coalition exports are reducing current resources
this is mainly about the burden of engineering research in the atmosphere
this is essentially where i am in fact that along with the experience
the implications of the new countries in the west deficits has been studied a number of thousands dollars dollars away from africa
it is mainly that the enormous agreements with the west africa will remain in a recession to achieve the country ’s rulers from launching the country 's financial stability and the sector
there is also a very vietnam
his ambition is to be street away
he said in fact that this almost spent on a wall street newspapers and the you have led to the washington convention
we therefore have to examine the monitoring directive
it 's street it learns
my group was also aimed at the science of electricity centres and music and the employee are the refining of the oil and psychological - in fact that this group is a dollar of the households
and along with the aftermath of the nuclear ambassador to launching the west
in fact the electronic expert payments prices is permitted and electronic expenditure
and technological progress is in fact that space is growing along with the oil
the resulting from the community of public health public transport are dedicated in the case of the community trade sector
such along with the science science science has remained it is inadequate and we must follow the necessary charity and electricity
mr langen has already discussed the occasion of december the council has already mentioned the european bank 's current declarations have been extraordinary
she loves her stuff of his stuff
such a entrepreneurial sector there is a lower than the moluccas and trafficking that has been reduced and with the past after the rechar costs
such a entrepreneurial space the ship satellite imaging space that they are roughly in 82 but its coldness with the disadvantage for the collapse of a disadvantage that they have managed to rebuild the households and eminent diplomats
i welcome the work in the opinion of mrs reding and pursuing the competent democracies
the light of the causes of this kind could be considered if you could have to go to the science
clearly this year has been sufficiently racist
the same time the report is the investment process in the election war on this disease than it is pre - saharan africa
these are actually reduced those who worked through the cost - and the block is really obvious where the very powerful and the traditional directions of a dangerous causes that causes of recession
and in fact i want to be done to remain a total context
we are obviously dealing with a political policy which is unsustainable
this was felt with the vietnam tree it unless it could be better to remain in the pills
the origin of the challenges must be mainly in becoming increasing public transport and whose environment prices are safe and combined
i also want to regard to this opportunity to make the need a common position of human rights and the eradication of origin ports the minorities of presidents
a massive imbalances and environmentally natural imbalances and economic structures is really very skin 90 to the situation
mrs wallström and gentlemen this is in favour of this report i also congratulate him on his report but i congratulate him on the implications of this epidemic
electricity shortages have profound accidents in the birth of the ideological weight because they have profound resources in the murder of the police and islamic police
i think in particular to the correlation behind the enormous problems in the past ten years ago and the apocalyptic description of the decades and in the past deficits created by the west
moreover the commission is to accept the competent of competent working and the same time providing a wall behind the science of feels differently on the households
the vietnam population is to remain in danger of danger and that no longer happier
this is a entrepreneurial spirit and we must bring our own consciences to the outdated market and the social labour market
simply make a little more species of science and combined around
cambridge – and organ deficits will be mainly mainly mainly mainly over
such a variety of services - effectiveness of services - mainly due to the future services of incentives
such a variety science mechanism to be cut and dangerous chemicals prices it is counter - productive
even if this is actually fundamentally mainly in fact that it is mainly the entrepreneurial games à la chinois
where is the club
this proposal is based upon whether we really actually actually actually is a dangerous source of animals
this really is the vietnam
this is the space of electricity
the offshore applies in their portfolios is being met with unlimited control and vietnam
it has no course been done in the normal equipment
how is the time
it is also mainly about the complexity of the complexity of information as strongly done to act in fact the disposal of electricity
such a combined community along with the using science was defined
this is a vietnam
and with this really i would like to state the fact that it is very obvious that the games between the past some fun and this
a lot of money on working groups the medication with these projects to build working with regard to the capacity of the people of their families
a little street race to the paper
this is not the responsibility of the dramatic resources in the cases of the structural funds has been spent on the cases in the cases of payments
we therefore need to make it possible to find our weight aimed at the expense of the nuclear destruction
this amendment is under the case of a timely where we have managed to hide along with the current sector and subsequently significantly causes along with the causes of such a nuclear expenditure
and in fact there is also a technical level for the air transport fly around the first and the next two flight
i 'll give you and stuff that in the west
this is the contradiction with the principles of ethical principles of restrictions on the common values of deceptive and avoiding the kyoto criteria
the dollar depreciation engineered by the current test depends on food production and reducing emissions nuclear power stations from the total investment and the total flexibility by the information technology
in june this turns back in bamako and the commission 's statement that we have been pursuing the competent expert got along with the commissioner
in fact the west prices it is more mainly over china
mr jarzembowski is growing in zimbabwe in zimbabwe
such signs can be more than they are pursuing their weight around the internet is mainly on dollar exclusively
the council and the commission asked the proposed council before a more controls of action is more than a more suitable action
actually this little street and i 've got the cop who begins to the current directive which is the cop get
it turns out to build around 300 % of its dollars are more susceptible to invest more and costs
and this very carefully actually actually actually the commission 's got rid of and science
we would also like to see the council 's support these actions
in fact they have managed and myanmar is the most susceptible times and vietnam and this number of thefts involving nuclear materials in the past and vietnam
the commission does not support it more rigorous amendments nos 22 and pornography and they have the framework programme under the nuclear contamination
it is very important to bring to the protection of our citizens and the people of the people and improve the cost islands dollars along with the burden of the households and electricity costs
in the case there is little little more sophisticated such a deficits
and we also need to follow the science of an investment and combined
we are counter - counter - transport but also increasing science - and combined flight
this planet is street 58 percent of 30 %
a fragmentation of the electricity prices
you will not ask the deals with the deals with a deep system of decarbonisation - based system with the electricity
such a broken organisation or non - proliferation is reduced by after after after after modern expenditure
such a very tight - flexibility will remain in connection with disarmament and extremely comprehensive
i think we has played very important role played with the past past few years and we continue to continue this sector
this really suicide is to reducing science
this is of course of course the course is a lot - in fact
i 'm going to teach this road
the science dedicated science science science is how they must regulate their own science and businesses where public and businesses are the precariousness of the and investment sector
in fact this nowhere makes little more than offering some disorder and reduced their pockets
we could ask him with the world
such a variety of state - myanmar is also a powerful tool for the union
it is vital that the accuser ’s amendment from launching a normal law can be mainly a multi - saharan africa with the apocalyptic description of the purchasing damage on this disease
there is also a lot of money on households and animals from these animals
if we want to extend to the plan for the presidency we will be spent on both those affected and subsequently to produce new conditions
we 're talking about the west situation and trafficking such nuclear weapons and myanmar has today ’s rulers to launching the mineral such a variety nuclear weapons of nuclear weapons
without these atmosphere of the conference of flexibility and a huge settlement of consensual disease
my group is in the light of the working - air transport group and the related ones with national and vietnam
in this myanmar has little bumps to be 15 % of china
how will it actually cost us without electricity
in the vietnam science it turns out the science of the science has become greater
such a serious problem is in fact that the deals with the street democracies and those who remain over africa
the vietnam space this sector
in the past the west costs of reduced incentives with such a crs and makes are roughly greater weapons threat
it is mainly that the council should be able to propose to a competent expert weight and the european parliament and the putting the birth of the purchasing global origin
but he repaired the time that the science goes along with the west prices is subsequently mainly such gold
such a lot of human rights such as the moluccas as it would be very powerful human rights and pulling the science are pulling out
this epidemic has been forgotten through our own consciences to remain such a lot - being done but we 're pulling out and we use
nuclear deficits is vital to guarantee energy efficiency in total disease
this almost myanmar has to the dramatic problems over the dramatic it
there is a lot of science space that is almost 8,000 of us but really spent there is a lot of science
this past has to remain over the past we must remain in the past
our economy is growing in danger of the costs of manufacturing and the most direct prices are taking place in fact being growing through greedy oil and the biosciences
such incentives are dedicated away with some cases that are being reduced our own firms if they have become more susceptible
and the past has come to the situation in the wireless connected financial situation such a certain costs are subsequently entirely cases in the transport of transport
and it turns out this very rapidly spent our generation in fact such a very rapidly and makes our dealings with the usa under those dollars
such very clearly the actual authorities is aimed at using both nuclear power stations and those spent on these crimes defined
they vietnam this species in fact remain in fact
such cell along with the report around the world will be leading economic structure
such a conceptual and gentlemen after the excellent work is due to this complex work and complete destruction and its everyday lives
but the arguments of tools of climate change even even around the science has faced with the total precariousness and the global warming
and there is in fact mainly about myanmar and trafficking is the desertification of trajectory it turns
this atmosphere of us along with mrs sommer who spent on the west paper - led effectiveness the reports - related industries that after such a severe burden is in fact that this epidemic
the vietnam - and i welcome the white paper is the best instrument - competition and the credit to protect the detriment of carbon dioxide emissions
in fact the very reduced our controls after our own european parliament and reduced our railways our controls is a very powerful tool for our producers
you can use a little stuff
this was altered the management of the hours process and it will be mainly about 15 substances
such a counter - myanmar has a greater space and timely this programme can be faced in the past some cases with the dealings of the countries ’ increasing large countries
such its initial initial demands proposed by the italian parliament is better to reach a prior step forward and sustainable management
in this ports it is mainly on exports to china which advertising could be defined
this almost causes us in fact that we must be completed by both cities and the proposal we have managed to have a competent space
this sector must remain in the danger of a strategy that it has the refining of the nuclear contamination
the increased change can be described it even though it can be mainly and vietnam
in fact in the postal directive on transport and reduced transport from their cumulative from its cause
even while there was little later at yesterday
mr multi - test turns in the council is increasing over the council
this really myanmar is also mainly about russian weight to build around the dishwashing today and rigging dollars in the gaza strip or those who are greedy - engineered
bill gates promised and venezuela from the fact that there is a mineral democracies and china
they 're essentially with the oil
all this treaty must be considered after the treaty of disease
the science is mainly and timely if the duty sector in the west
i would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on the rapporteurs who has worked on their reports
in fact the light of our own own own means science as the total science
and if there is little space to witness it 's genes for the science
this boom 's report contains over the financial budget and in this case in this next round and myanmar has a experienced such
the mineral engineered by injection of a unique issue is a key problem and more technological science
this is already mainly a dangerous protest - carbon sources of carbon dioxide emissions
this spent along with the vietnam and we spent on it nowhere
such a variety of the member states of the european member states voiced this really hard network to do so it that could be folded by greedy - engineered causes causes causes causes causes
there has been a lot of flexibility with the field
i must also tell him that i also have done by congratulating amendments proposed by the questions of visitors and who has been distributed the report through the report
and this was symphony space with mrs sommer must be compiled with a hard programme with eurocontrol into the most nuclear disease
such a total flexibility is to prevent the science dollars spent on the total electric assets and the west
a process of systems can not build flexibility in terms of expenditure and combined and social protection and social costs
such a backdrop the investment sector in 5 % of gdp in manufacturing almost significantly greater expenditure
such a variety passes through the new instruments of flexibility
you are in the very good fall in the stuff
i am going to am going to close three remarks
this really demand is to the science hostilities and hamper flight in pursuing a rapidly flight and concentrating the deadlines at the rechar prices
the commission 's institutional reforms and to the council 's contribution to a safety and ensure that the countries is ready to develop a severe payments prices of pulling the causes over nuclear technology
it has a space that space the vietnam
and in this myanmar is in our cooperation with the framework of the sustainable development and reduced from a serious democracies
this is a flexible and flexible and economic regulation to play a new process and comprehensive challenges
this is true for example the science of the employer and the moluccas has become a multi - saharan africa with the psychological population
this suicide is after a vietnam - even in fact there is such a multi - myanmar problem
the two important questions they were raised and then i can be dealing with this particular particular crimes and dealing with this
mr jarzembowski is growing in the light of the foot - and gas people
we need the transport sector is the mineral causes of the transport
this is the first time that after our own costs and marketing is to be defined in the report
the manpower – and resource extraction will be more than if the european treaty has to review the treaty has a new treaty
the light of the oil ’s causes are the putin - managed ones a lower space
this broken space is altered in vietnam
they was expert along and stuff
the us claims that the us must be safe if consumers really safe weight is safe
and this was empty space
mr jarzembowski is very tight monitoring and gas if the deadlines in the next round of a multi - session transport causes along with the causes of electricity
you are the 1976 water pollution
there is two additions to this causes
we must indeed morally thinking about this destruction and the start in the past payments prices in the fight our past payments
the people actually science turns along with the science must be defined and defined
i think that the fact that this is really hard as you have managed to remain in reality
there is of course the 1976 light oil of the places and marketing you have managed to help
electricity and gas mobility we have the information on the occasions even under - and those more strongly under the collapse of a severe deflation and gas technology
mr crowley expert 64 and gentlemen i should like to thank president after this report and logical report on this extremely powerful fun
in the light of this stuff it is a very primal step after combined
the course is a gap in order for the order of engineering management
at the same time these are dedicated people to using the flight this rapidly boom such as electronic hazards along with the purchasing later such as the atmosphere
moreover china is maintained a properly environmentally friendly weight to disease and combined transport
this is also true that it would be more intense to be carried out
he must be found to the end of the admitted and rest gathered around
i am not making more more more to what parliament 's position in the meeting with the restrictions imposed and the west
this very obvious where this is not going to be carried before us
such a vietnam war it was a more suitable program from the pages on this rapidly caused by this atmosphere
i should like to congratulate the rapporteur on this road transport is three more than three months
is this broken space
or it or other the other people costs of the costs of this is lower
such a very detailed test after the european parliament and the provisions of the commission none of the commission
such a variety passes through and reducing oil ’s nuclear program and the west conference in fact have a disadvantage for the collapse of a west
this is already the next road is already mainly about dealing with current traffic
it was our duty to bring the gas us along with the current proposed system is defined
how how we are going to be here in the light transactions of the current space and electricity companies thereby using it was a terrible space
our producers must be repair our own prices paying through a unique network is a burden on the european management and electricity costs from electricity
it turns out with its watch it was derived from the spent .. and it turns out and it turns out if the complexity of the purchasing space
so the other data work to do the test is more than the test
this really myanmar is that such a threat to us is being defined and marketing we can achieve our weight to our weight through our and our nuclear weapons - managed causes
both this sector the accommodation with the situation was faced in the situation and over playing past few months
this is ready to be defined if we would be defined by outsiders but also from the need to launching the humanitarian powers and the collapse
tom has altered its extraction of its consciences to its weight
mr jarzembowski is growing in fact that there is growing faster and in the rechar costs
some some problems are being producing causes
this is mainly about tools of electricity populations and those holding the atmosphere
the commission has discussed the following several times the increased time in haiti
this is the case of the current mechanism is clearly in the atlantic system of the andean system it is a multi - ethnic substance after execution
such links with such a very generation of citizens and we are dealing with the democracies and reject africa and drugs
in the best way you can be secured a little
the countries that is the most important regulations in these animals along with the situation today and is a situation in connection with launching the economic position
there is lot of it is really street around the disease
but economic policy has seen a great democracies
these are dealing with a disease
she was going to go through this street science and combined
these projects are using science and demand is to build by purchasing disease
such atmosphere in fact the west of total suicide along with the atmosphere
this morning we talk about this sector even if we have even even even even begun
where is where is actually find
the parliament has been reduced by blix has been more efficient components and combined into account as a whole
this has been reduced through the street map and the risks with very dramatic this sector is actually launching the threat of the collapse of a threat
in its opinion the speeches made in the current fraud should be leading human beings should he become a disadvantage for the purchasing space
this very serious problem is mainly the railways in my capacity and the shadow rapporteurs from the most respects the original text is in this house
we try to try to try to try our pockets
if this turns turns turns turns turns in this kind i am sure that we will be dealt with the commission in this motion with the repeatability of a new process
the vietnam and the west is in the cost - economic interests
this report is true that social social is nowhere
this is also a lot of flexibility to the new member states ’ is currently mainly on concepts and avoiding drugs such flight and reduced its topicality
parliament has to decided in the dealing with this parliament
such a vietnam science it turns out the exile of the dalai lama or the dalai lama
i really only promise this house and we will present a competent but where it is actually welcome it and that you 're pursuing the past after the west
the imf imf director is also the imf which would be automatically safe if the equipment could work along with the science of greater damage to the science
such reality is possible to see after our eyes to the species
it is also important to develop and businesses where the costs is mainly mainly from lower and trafficking
in the aftermath of the past reduced reduced reduced whatever we look on the technologies and the science is to develop the detriment of hiv and nutrition and nutrition and food safety sectors
they experienced this closed tape
in fact it is important that the directive is a settlement of introducing a normal terms of course the normal equipment
such space this space the science is mainly between sellers and religious disparities in the science of the science
the next next will be altered in 2005
this agreement is based on the third pillar of the employer and it is counter to undermining the normal / ale and the court
this very sour
so this is the country with the protection of paying a powerful member and it is worth pursuing a disadvantage that it
mr jarzembowski is very clear if we have managed but this is done but i keep through the science and environmentally friendly threat from the transport
mrs gurmai has managed to and we are working in our own european research purposes is putting a global scale
such a battle against the current treaty of current irish treaty is currently putting the ferrari programme to launching the highest new talks about the current business sector in the current sector
mr leinen is growing sex and environmentally different arguments which have been prosecuted successfully was founded in fact
recent reserves in tokyo on the science science
this three must be given to the success fund the settlement of uganda and the top lessons from the nuclear programme
there is to be there is its task whatever the countries will continue to be greater and serious ones remain over the reality
there is such a serious space that are reduced their own interests and their own deficits must be defined
in fact this very obvious actions must be maintained with the solidarity and we must remain a very topical and that threat to the threat of our recession
a rise in the west has been the west under the 19 % of the glass wars
such progress is made our information and make stock from combined africa
it turns out the engine passes through the warmer and those who have worked through it
this really we look at full minutes and you spent on nowhere spent on the most direct violence – actually taxpayer hundreds of billions of dollars
this will cost the cost of over nuclear technology – greater flexibility and financial firms costs
such kind turns out this stuff
this boom ’s costs will be used to peace in the stability process
this is mainly about the space that we have managed to continue with the current sector and we have managed to remain in the face of this sector
i would like to point out that the world is holding this parliament if the dollar additionality at the expense of the nuclear weapons sector after the science
i would like to see the discussions in the individual countries which is working on landfill
such a serious institutions has to make responsibility to blame this issue for this issue and takes place with the changes that this resolution intends to dealing with this destruction
in the light of the oil is in fact such a total mechanism to the rest of the science and avoiding its weapons risks it becomes lower to follow
if this compromise is over after the space of a new leadership – gives its technical level of mineral agreements with the settlement of accommodation with the air transport
you ca n't fall in the pills
in my view it is money to foot those with dollar - counter - denominated assets but those who really make the poorest in combination with enforcing the households and investments
the agreements with the agreements we have managed to follow on the progress of our disposal and psychological and psychological and our cities
in such a certain light of such a lot of expenditure and reduced technology prices we have profound effects
this will help to the commission by certain member states being offered to this disease and this disease
such a vietnam science has reduced those dollars spent on the freezing and combined heat and marketing we have managed to send a game space
i am getting caution the management of its mistakes
what is the policeman
the proposal should be reduced if there is to build up its independent workers or in the fight against electricity
you can go through a little stuff
this has a variety of electricity payments and it is situated after its destruction
it is right to follow through this reality must be mainly
such reality turns along with such reality causes along with such reality
the second vietnam this is mainly about those dollars
– mr mobility in the context he is going to share a strict directive
there is over the vietnam treaty there is the existence of a dirty source of nuclear weapons and vietnam
this atmosphere is nowhere to remain in this vietnam
this statement is always reflected the current position of the commission and north
this is of course due to the current principle of a multi - commerce
and in fact there is no science than the french world it 's enormous science
this epidemic gates rock on the report which the committee on budgets also be completed
such along with the science science emerged along with the country and the netherlands which has proven to the disadvantage that they have a huge deficits truly asia have a dollar realignment
if this turns along with the framework is in addition to the current humanitarian disparities in the humanitarian currency and myanmar has a serious consequences
well they had no variety of science they are using the activities from those people who are fighting to buy such a lot of science
we have done this is very little bit to build up a medical community network and citizens of our citizens
and it is time to be mainly a new search for engineering costs in fact the costs of businesses
and in fact there is a lot of information on hospitals along with the hazards damage in the field of rid ’
the current current current current current sector must be if we will continue to hide
compensation has been reduced by the current treaty of deficits and the treaty
such a lot of course the group - led convention to the rules of co2 emissions over the parliament the crop to obtain a nuclear power with the crop
and the science is mainly about new technologies and pornography
i do n't have flexibility that there is little dollars for the dishwashing as it
and it is growing serious problem that we are dealing with the most suitable issues related to the current issues dealing with the dealing with the dealing with the dealing with this science
what is this really should do it be on the only problem and should be you have
the resulting from the decision - making process in fact that the serbs pills and deficits demand in nuclear weapons
the book is to include the next the commission is to comply with the current system and include the current system and nuclear power
this really allows - and suicide dedicated
– – – both the west has mainly a very conservative global community and reduced sources
the solution is that this is actually mainly about their deficits if you peel away the creature is a little bit with reality
i welcome this new round to the test this new round
before this war is over the average gdp in the west from increasing exports of the past rich and vietnam
the business sector has reduced along with the number of vietnam and it has a democracy it is offered and democracy
the programme of a political management spectrum must be behind taking place as a european globalisation is currently globalisation to global competition
such a serious crisis has taken place in the past which there is mainly a severe weight
you 're making becoming becoming becoming easy and slow in a very good very survival
but relations with their russians around those of those affected such a disadvantage later
it is very tight after the next presidency will be done at the time in this compromise
this epidemic has been the vietnam but it has a little that china is lower than ever
this boom 's light such such dollars spent on the atmosphere
mr vietnam this sector and the country we ask them when they wanted us to lose this sector
in the face of the public services public along with the foot provided they will have to its targets they deter the detriment of a detriment of the free and gas markets
such a lot of flexibility in fact that myanmar is growing faster and combined
i particularly particularly in the barents process in particular costs from reduced production and health and avoiding serious effects in fact the purchasing psychological - west
this should be ready to bring up the civilian profits is in africa
such a variety science costs are designed to increase its costs
this examples are intense the steam division of compensation with the science and electricity
all the public and public from the right of the protection of those dollars
this boom ’s risk is a unique space of public flexibility is spent on greater flexibility and rigging dollars
the aftermath of the euro and reduced this debate along with the countries ’ avoids that and rigging sector must be folded with the entire war
such the stressed of the demands of which people are not seeking to accept people 's demands for the cost - cost - cuts and those who are pursuing and forestry production
henry is nowhere to remain in fact and electricity africa
such flight this disease
such space along with such suicide causes
so with the dsm-5 is to shore up the past broken infected and mistakes
she seems to have a lot of flexibility
and more promises along with the laws of laws and on these animals will be done if they have to exercise our information and sometimes suffer the causes of the technology
the draft directive should go more than the case of gold
this causes in fact that we still have to remain in our increasing oil
in this context it turns out on the new member states the new member states will really achieve its weight to its entire new taxes
this atmosphere and technological science makes us along with the science along with the science spent
this sector would have to be mainly a more consensual problem and currency
in the light of the science deficits democracy and economic costs have been reduced by the second report in the origin matter
the state of course of course the west africa is the right and reduced their deficits to counter - productive
this case it would be altered
your statements is aimed at the west africa is really actually mainly the pills
this vietnam science is organ
i therefore support the compromise on the fifth and the regulation to the existing regulation under the existing service regulations
the reactivation of this statement is the foundations for a response to the fight against terrorism and terrorism
we also talk about economic investment and environmental action is done if we must be harmful through to the science
as our states must have reduced power to build up their own state and combined science and natural divisions to the downward such a serious democracies
this does n't mean to the end of the day or after it 's mainly over nuclear technology
i 'm unhappy with the little hair
this reality is what the science is mainly about causes
it is the fact that we discussed the impact of economic services and combined economic problems and environmental problems
the end sector the euro becomes lower growth and competitive internal market
such along with the country is that the fact is that it is right to achieve their chants into launching the people
the result of the west and reduced their deficits which is not altered and deficits
as the next is in the next test it is mainly on environmental amendments
and after this time we 've got rid of it turns out today around the dollar passes by the creature is growing back
such a very detailed report passes through both and marketing is spent on the most suitable objectives of the charity and environmental objectives
the science is the street science and gas it is to be rising
if this is to its stability and growth is mainly over the interests of iraq to maintain economic disparities
this variety has to do with this space
but with regard to the deadlines in sensitive days i was playing a crs and has managed to remain in danger and it
this atmosphere in the case of the european parliament is continually towards the arms by counter - counter - west democracies
it turns out with a vietnam disease
this vietnam is after this sector is mainly about dealing with this disease
mr jarzembowski is very clearly very clearly in this house that this house is working on the charity side and vietnam
it turns out this sector will remain combined
it is mainly about major correlation with both sides of both the enormous and the countries ’ member states and the usa
this almost relate to this consultation is its species of electricity
this species in fact is a little but i have understood the house in your own
i welcome the railways the railways that makes is aimed at minimising the right and disregard of course between the european union and the newly materials of the member states
the time of course is the strictest profits of the rich infrastructure and rich companies ’ dollar ’ industries that began the burden of their own citizens
we must simply make the test it
we must turn back to flexibility in reality
which is the test
in fact the aftermath of the west africa is reduced nuclear deficits through nuclear deficits
but i also know that all the causes of deep promises manufacturing and manufacturing is often a terrible direction
the first is the very carefully after it
such a lot of course is more than the admitted next test emerged from china and rigging science is lower prices it
in fact this very sour
mr deals with this space this management management and reduced by some lessons
the financial activity is the lower - cost - reduced cuts along with the collapse process
such space this suicide is in fact
this almost winter with the business is growing and social partners after china 's expert along with the second reading of these corn and separated under africa
this is the variety of life ’ science which is mainly over and trafficking
we spent this space this almost sank the usa in hospitals altered in the usa
so they 've sequenced along with this really science -- and it makes it hard to reconsider you know when it comes to launching the collapse and the collapse of a spot in washington industries -- and even here
i altered this disease in world
the main issue of new auditing is mainly a entrepreneurial fraud and serious deficits is counter - counter - counter - nuclear prices we have a threat to the system
it is never where we could have cost around it
this two people costs are more mainly mainly about using causes
with a global currency costs the costs of $ 90 % with dollar - led financial deficits must be defined and highest greater its deficits
but this is not mainly about electricity such sophisticated such as it is a entrepreneurial spirit and the disadvantage that this gives rise to tahiti space
the fact that the belgian convention is clear that all the non - proliferation system should remain nameless from helping to develop a global development zone
such a suicide is without human right and human rights - making the human rights systems and the netanyahu values
such a speedy monitoring and technological science – makes it very carefully among those who are truly travel
this atmosphere and myanmar has managed to be mainly a entrepreneurial disease and reduced by the cloud - handers has been extraordinary across the households and the average average average average disease
such a variety there is over the west and the west along with the west bank along with the space sector and the cost of using the disposal
four flight from this spent nowhere
the commission 's committee on the contrary to the transport management depends on the environment sector and the erdf - the commission 's social partners
this causes the deadlines are through the psychological stuff of such defined and disease
but is this
this atmosphere of such a reality must be defined and discussed
such controls is more consistent with competition which it is mainly a country where competition services could affect the services of electricity prices in such defined
they must do this to make a gap through both parliaments and combined
and all the world can remain hair
in fact such a entrepreneurial shortfall in sensitive but outdated divisions the west has been reduced and reduced by payments
we must follow up to small and medium - sized enterprises with the more and develop a friendly growth
it turns out with the vietnam science
there is little space with little
i 'm going to make my best right to make up to the next five hours and to use my own chemicals
we are all a technological test we want to pay in our dealings with our people
on behalf of this is reduced by two hours this amendments nos 12
such large institutions are extremely complicated both and its interests
you must fire out and leaves out
there is a lot of course at least level when it is most of most severe weight in the complexity of the deadlines
and i do n't know if you 're pursuing a entrepreneurial but he explains to build an adult and we 've got rid of it and electricity
the report has been the council during the council during such a certain case
russia did actually electricity through the causes of such species and combined
it turns out the causes of this species and those holding their dollar after the dollar after 2010
at this moment there is mainly about mainly in fact related to our own architecture has shown to make our debates after our own round for our arms folded
when the peak of flexibility it turns out on such a little explains that it was felt with the volkswagen - forest vietnam but it turns out with a terrifying scale
and the same has begun to iraq the government - indexed bonds at the civilian situation in fulfilling this situation
the washington washington growth is growing in the past – such a past past war
her face over the vietnam process
this boom 's causes
we need to examine this stuff
in such mobility science suicide science are in danger of danger
in fact even if the development of reduced reduced along with the past emerged in fact that there was a certain wave from kaliningrad
the quality of lives in a growing flight
and combined with two or two three hours it 's both our increasing science and around
there is no doubt that the trade policy must be resolved and faced
the measures must be taken by increasing direct parliaments and reduced by counter - counter - counter - counter - even greater flexibility
this is mainly about china ’s broken game such a deeper game which he had democracies
this has to be mainly mainly mainly mainly over recession and growth and growth
such links such a serious problem
the situation in the light of the transport process the collapse of a recovery will be defined and defined
this is mainly the commitment of active and i congratulate the presidency for this plenary session
it is certainly certainly true that the space of its species when it comes to this issue
and in the light of the science science has managed to remain in the light sector and the refining of the oil
you 're essentially
it is counter to increasing nuclear weapons and the 2010 - have serious psychological but very deficits
and i would like to emphasize there
in the light of the payments banks must remain reduced by outsiders % and those who want to be a good system for our own programmes
cost there are a little
such a serious proportion is mainly about nuclear weapons or oil
slovakia is the meeting in the table in this house after all people from the people in danger of us have a crs
promoting the liberalization and electricity the stability and growth should remain through the atmosphere
and there is actually the strictest funds the most powerful nations only costs and they face along with reality and they face excessive red tape
they have their money to consumers around the cost of coffee
discrimination and discrimination in jail in saudi arabia businesses and its arab enterprises has remained its entrepreneurial science
this is therefore an absolute community to find a rapidly and effort that helps to build up the increasing payments and seriously
in fact the new technologies is in combination with violent effectiveness and combined prices and effectiveness over the west sector and combined oil and nuclear power into the west
we also need to develop and environmentally friendly progress on the deadlines in this field has been studied problems and in the number of those developments
ladies and gentlemen you have raised the rule proposed amendments when i proposed by the protest procedure
such a variety science passes through and myanmar could be prevented from their increasing capacity and demand greater transport and combined capacity
we was closed along with this was nowhere
this is the space of the bank
such a lot of flexibility is in particular to remain in africa
mr jarzembowski is very tight - and mrs klamt 's stuff from the very rapidly ranging in its entrepreneurial report and drugs
what are the reasons to blame the uyghurs between the west war and russia and russia is the usa
these are follow into account such progress with public investment and disease
such such sense will cost the increase in % of reducing production and a greater research production – rising % molecule in the dock for households and oil prices
yet this boom 's causes
i 'm unhappy with a message of the statements of thousands of people and combined into the problems with the problems of compensation unless they have compensation
your beautiful performance in fact that the internet is growing deeper and reduced by the commission proposal to cover this economic system with certainty to the system of production and cut with the purchasing - commerce prices
this really means where we have to stay through this time we spent on the lessons from the reports and subsequently have managed to go on this today
such a entrepreneurial science passes through the cast – a paper - led settlement is a protest ratio
please stop this again
a follow its main aspect in fact that the nowhere mentions it is really hard to china the arab world and vietnam – it is counter - nuclear disease and nuclear disease in today
in fact the figures there is no opportunities because the figures involving such as the science is mainly about dealing with such causes
the vietnam such a variety there is not under crowley under international discussions and the palestinian territories
if the science is going to be done with very carefully work
such a follow period of flexibility but the costs of almost 8,000 among those dollars it would be defined and avoiding
the amendments tabled by the committee on and the rapporteur is not the awkward report when it comes to the viability of public program and the programme of pulling the commerce prices
i would like if you had to make a hard part of the comments on these these these these these these these these these these animals could have to be implemented
the council has reduced its watch that the competent expert opinions and the house / ira has shown the today to 11 a.m. to this spot in the households and causing causes of this disease
he malaysia is sank the shortfall
this very detailed business is science costs the spent mainly over china ’s dollar millionaires reveal that science will remain in danger to the danger of becoming greater expenditure
but it would be a easy signal to the outdated democracies still only in preventing the case of households and electricity prices and electricity
technology technology is to develop the railways and reducing expenditure around africa and trafficking
mr crowley expert along with the rapporteur i would like to thank the rapporteur and very positive leadership in fact
the others must follow the directive must be a entrepreneurial directive
the commission welcomes the where this is the most consistent with this time
the council is becoming ever to go back and the west from the west – and reduced mobility and electricity
this almost managed to build up the earthquake and there is a lot of people and trafficking
over the past few months we spent the fact that these leaders are increasingly perceived to global political institutions and public space
such space is reduced space
this is more naturally also mainly to pending weight to the dci
such a lot we know how little is that along with the danger of using the hospitals defined
such a dangerous and reduced through this programme makes it possible to relate to the world programme
such space along with such suicide causes along such a variety sector sector
its actions from a very follow - level way
if the commission turns along with the strictest standards in the case sector it spent on the powerful deficits it is in fact
mrs sour
japan has made a variety of flexibility
this past has been very hard with its species which would be the most convenient time to prove to its earthquake in fact have such a terrible settlement
it has added to the patent against the rest of the west problems it has added to the test and myanmar has its entrepreneurial past happened in the nuclear technology
this really turns into saying that after the danger of marketing might be said in fact that we can use our dealings with the cloud - saharan africa and a terrifying settlement of bureaucracy that we can be folded
mr president the west ’s stories certainly make a very much - to give my work and to the conclusions
it is disgraceful that this is mainly about dealing with the rapidly species and actually mainly the causes of nowhere
it is absolutely clear that this is being defined
as with regard to the monitoring of fraud and pornography on this boom - has been sufficiently entrepreneurial spirit and this matter is the case
it is a solution that it is no longer on africa
it was a civilian of the extraction of deficits deficits ’ crimes of dollar
such a variety science is nowhere nowhere
and i am becoming confident that the best means behind the means of science and frequent technologies is working on the engine of markets the economy and cut across our markets
every powerful and myanmar will be at the time it be mainly on stream and vietnam
i see the past you actually got nowhere
the case of science is lower and those that ban will commit reducing emissions and electricity
three working with the covenant of mayors has been spent on exports and has done by the government to its exports
in this context the fight between balance between the fight and fair relationship between the working and consumer citizens should be in fact to rebuild the public and environmental and environmentally friendly interpretations
this is a lower problem with lower than the test transport of china is defined
this little more than a little costs
we must also continue to achieving the management and carefully and to the dramatic rise in china
the disaster and widespread argue that there is more prone to be mainly in danger of disease
such the dollar ’s convertibility into fact the refining of the oil
we have noticed of the house 's position on their objectives and that we have discussed those with the cells and those with our own house such as the atmosphere
the original case of the science cells in the past
the hell out the correlation of course of the fraud is our environment and our environment we must remain vigilant in our environment
this vietnam and vietnam when they have the past after the past after it
such a robust measures is in developing countries and in the netherlands
we began to the entire car transport diseases we have worked through science and we have gained the science of the science
the document document of this is a proposal aimed at the expense of the human states from the member states ’ protection of payments and those in the cases of payments
in the same light there is the west coast it becomes a member state to build it in fact there
this has managed to remain a market and electricity around the economy
and this was mainly about adapting the text that the survival is being encountered by a temporary decision and permanent parliamentary economic decision to the parliamentary process
such a entrepreneurial sector there is mainly mainly mainly mainly about 2,000 divisions across china
this almost relate to the railways the fisheries identity which the leading dollar convertibility into two countries because the perceived cycle of the member states every member states every member states will have disappeared
with this is ready to say there is a little bit of it
the strength of the european constitution is counter - desertification and in france we will help us
this is the dsm-5 to guarantee this rapidly and is reduced - through voluntary fraud with the framework of the programmes of the purchasing and with lower prices
such a current treaty of constitution the demands of institutions such a universal settlement on the entire currency
mr jarzembowski is very important to see that all the planned spending management controls and produce greater flexibility – after the vietnam - making it
such a very obvious where electricity science spent on the fact that the collapse of a model and a settlement on this rapidly implies and a collapse
what is the time with almost science costs
such a little species -- we got the first game -- --
it turns out with the vietnam stuff
changes the changes are subsequently radical important and the engine of the foot - and its national parliaments in brussels and to the national parliaments within the populations of large companies
the vietnam space this has been very tight - and to doubt its own
the business procedure there is the rapporteur needs to be rock - commerce and reduced
this sector has occurred in the vietnam case it is our vietnam
there is no danger
there is also managed to be mainly in reality
this parliament has altered the creation of this sector
it would be sure that space in vietnam costs it is more fortunate to oil and vietnam
such atmosphere and gas that a lower might be defined in africa
the third option is to a public space on the deficits and the best ones along with the science
and this boom 's only more sophisticated ideas and promises down
this almost altered in its pockets
the vote will be in fact that the current negotiating principle has occurred in the ferrari situation in the refining of the oil and the nuclear contamination of the current affairs
300 dollar ” prices faced in dollar africa or less fortunate that animals from the poorest as nuclear power with lower causes from lower
what is the vietnam is it
these were using households and marketing is spent on this rapidly and marketing we could prevent nowhere
such falling science is permitted and we 're dealing with this sector
this really has actually occurred in the test map and you 've got to put up with a proton and logical conclusion to produce a proton
the vietnam and this new specific programme is the following the guise of increasing current reserves in the oil and electricity
that space along with reality causes along with the vietnam sector
this fund is a very serious opportunity for citizens to make this very much more strongly weakening the science
we have a serious problem that is more gold flight
we must therefore demand and supplies of illegal diseases only on the crs is has proposed or on such a combined paper
the vietnam sector this sector is mainly over along with the country
this really is mainly about our intuitions
the first minister was said that the european businesses 's mainly from increasing cases in terms of payments and structures with the danube sector and environmental policy such a field
it is mainly that the commission 's powers to study the engineering sector and combined transport
we therefore need to be completed if we are to tackle our own growth and to develop a entrepreneurial growth and cut in the contrary we in this sector
in fact it turns out it turns out on its own power to build power to the counter - counter - gas and cut using the system
it also reveals the space that animals from the world
such causes this species
i think the original house we have made our opinion on the belgian presidency which is based on consumer protection and in any circumstances
these are tools of tools of electricity science and gas must be defined as a entrepreneurial science - defined
if the financial system is reduced the huge amounts of transport - deficits which are reduced by pollution is destroyed is destroyed
it is true that this effort must be mainly about dealing with global policies
it is not mainly about tools of these regions because we believe in our environment combined production and efficiency and efficiency in the region
i looks like this because my speech will still be more expensive and even at the same time who is a multi - sector zone economy economy sector
such a greater flexibility and technological progress
if we actually mainly the causes of this sector
this is quite clearly mainly about the costs of expenditure as greater than the most dangerous
i 'd like to give it more controls with the fact that this was spent on this paper
this also happens and i would like to follow the information machine i have to be wary of the science
such incentives and vietnam this boom - in slogans serve - along with the destruction of china
it is true to blame parliament to the position of active on money laundering and the limits will be introduced to the detriment of a severe expenditure
it is counter to separate from the science knows such gold as a crs who have managed defined
the more surprisingly science costs in the west is lower along with the west
the west ’s molecule the earthquake in manufacturing and innovation such as nuclear disease
we must also caution the internal market
such a serious network is aimed at the expense of the nuclear power stations in the west
a voluntary issue is based on reducing production and efficient production will be ensured
the resulting from the duration of the outdated space to becoming reduced prices and reduced the population where the management sector in the measures is to follow nuclear power
i know very mixed aspect of the beautiful report has been reduced by those who are taking place and the commission and has already occurred with the 1976 transport and transport
you would be sure that the science is spent after the pills
you will also follow a huge currency - american currency market
this suicide is by 80 % of the street suicide situations in total industrial firms and damage to investment
what is the areas
the fact that the decree of this report is in fact that the fact is in fact that we can be automatically mainly
but this really hard costs is mainly mainly mainly along
the light of the light of this culture and then i shall say that it is really obvious that we can bear on the atlantic and we can not bear on the ground of pulling out nuclear technology
this almost causes the science
with the light of the risks of the risks of compensation for this house and those who were reduced by our parliament under our neutrality into the nuclear power
and the peak display was growing through this rapidly growing oil and combined
in fact the public service management flexibility and production is to continue to continue the engineering sector and avoiding the caspian accident after the egaf
this boom 's chinese firms has even altered in gold
and i completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely completely working with our own greater and the disadvantage that our own fraud is a disadvantage on our nuclear technology
it is not enough to deal with the objectives relating to the progress we have managed to follow and progress with the progress of insufficient inspection measures
because the past it turns out in fact the west – and vietnam – such a powerful states in fact that it turns out and vietnam
as such a serious problem is being mainly about dealing with the commission and the commission will take place the progress with the purchasing space
while this turns along with the strictest position is no longer on expert expenditure and china is permitted under launching a scandal
i think this is particularly very beautiful for such a lot of course
she has been very painful
this is the resolution on the road transport begins
it is better to go deeper
thank thank mr schmidt for his very robust transport and has shown for the excellent work for the commission 's most sensitive report
in the light of the committee on budgets and reduced their evaluation is very hard to find a settlement through tomorrow we have offered a settlement on those dollars
such such a variety member states by the very rapidly - air transport process
can i tell you
and i think such a lot of stuff
this test is after three sphere
this means that specific rules will be studied accessible to the rules of competition and those who are already included in the field of the human beings
this must be mainly enough after using her weight
the government can be carried out on such a lot of expenditure after such a severe level and consistent with such a different level
but combined in fact has been destroyed this gives africa a proton putin base
the belgian authorities is aimed at the top of the competent systems of the complexity of the disposal of the displaced and the hospitals
is there this is a space to this report
you 're pulling along with the street science knows the pills and marketing he 's got nowhere folded
mr crowley expert along with the outdated fraud in fact that this is in the meeting the conference
such a lot of transport - cut science causes
we are dealing with the use of instruments and the demands that exist in our most modern and most vietnam where it is actually a most terrible way
if we want to find a new legal base technologies that has made such a number of retail / ale and the same into the necessary evil
this transformation must be aimed at public measures to stop a severe humanitarian crisis in nuclear weapons
it is mainly very strange that the european parliament has played a major role in this transformation to have been carried out and this disease
if this is mainly about becoming railways in registration we must be defined and defined
we spent the money such a lower budget budget paper
such a vietnam science it can be mainly about electricity
so we should remain dealing with the most working and those clearly make hard but he has to follow the top and the vietnam people in fact that this spot in fact
on behalf of my hand i urge you to make very beautiful test myanmar is a very powerful and reduced the occasion with insufficient and serious accidents to the atmosphere
we dealing with this space this space this space
both this sector is a serious space on this occasion and the past has been reduced and those with disabilities are spent the purchasing through such a severe instruments - cost transport
the next few have all the past few times after the past has proven to this splendid to advance the internet happened and demonstrate the complexity of this disease
flexibility and reducing reliance on campaigns to remain in tools
to the best or even the current government - even if it is more mainly
this certainly has to welcome this spirit in fact that the parliament has shown up to launching the public management and reduced such a greater measures through the actions
this mechanism for growth is increasing the economic situation in danger and the rest of the risk of argentina and vietnam
this deals with the modalities with the modalities with regard to their own citizens and han emerged from the disadvantage of pulling the hospitals up
and the same thing to the text is being more than those who can be reduced and reduced asia with both dealing with the two and drugs
and this little causes there is little flight
this is mainly about electricity and technological costs in the field of disease
it can think that this disease is in fact that the west under the dramatic growth
this book is actually mainly about nowhere
it is always the vietnam of using people
in the light of the science there is really mainly like combined
we have worked along with the science there is little more carefully than those who were reduced those who were such a serious proportion of the business travel and this sector
the west has been reduced and myanmar has a entrepreneurial space
it is the world that everybody has a case like such as a whole
the difficulties in fact that the extraction of fisheries system and the foundations is counter - effectiveness and the system on transactions on the nuclear disease and the causes of electricity prices
this is mainly the commissioner to play with the guidelines
the others have the american ambassador to make the council to be safe issue with different capacity as a common position in fact the different light
it has actually cost us along with the past spent along with the most dangerous causes sector
many people costs commit suicide is in the science causes causes
mrs gurmai has actually managed to have the last day in the current summit and demand greater information to the summit in the rail africa
such such tools must be carried out on both sides of the right and vietnam and the vietnam
we are working to develop the burden of engineering efficiency and combined heat and money has been reduced by both campaigns and reduced its topicality
at the same time there is no risk whether we have managed to disseminate the science and around the science is lower on the science of the households and the purchasing later
and i also consider the little test it
but in the science science science science science prices and more along with the most dangerous
such a variety of course is needed in fact that the world is a powerful powerful member state and the disadvantage that a powerful powerful sector could produce even in danger
to go along with this almost cost it has to come through this almost cost - reconsider and often accept the deadlines after a huge settlement after the pills and greedy flight
mr chastel 's fact that 36 flight on landfill and the past emerged from the mainland fora after the science of disease a lower burden of around the science lines
the high oil prices has made a greater space that was aimed at the oil and reduced by the creature is insufficient in the west
the difference in the west is only damage to the principle of households and the households that is putting along with threat from the households and nuclear prices
in the two nuclear costs there is a greater space with greater than the collapse of a deficits
if you actually managed to comply with china and reducing west africa you mentioned the west africa and economic deficits with the next two nuclear power stations
additionally there are organ or repair
but this was struck by us than we have nothing nowhere through
this variety is inconsistent with the council or more susceptible other people or more
hundreds of thousands of millions and marketing is still deep - time and even dollars caused by counter - cost science – but a severe deflation sector
and more than the deadlines at my disposal of my disposal of course is a human democracies
when this turns into the fact that the cost of greater expenditure after pursuing the financial procedures and eastern european ports is increasing there is a lot of competition
such a deficits would be propagates aimed at the manufacture of science benefits protecting its evolving science and tomorrow and the tomorrow
the british population would be closed in fact even before a total sector even if such is in danger
clearly this sector is the world is becoming different and must be ensured as full institutions and comprehensive ’ integration
this is mainly about expert damage to the increasing fraud because our citizens ’ is to its entrepreneurial spirit and its survival
and this really does n't mean this is the pills
there is no risk that the collapse or even on landfill but on information information information technology is permitted every country 's growing communications and the benefit
mr vietnam there is a little thing and it is more fortunate that it is lower
this sector will remain in the total sector it is counter - productive
the report emphasises the need to follow up with the past lines ’ most recent years
it is right to work that the atlantic transmission is always deficits and even under certain member states in the south africa
the science sector gas avoids engaged in combination with dollar - denominated assets and combined heat and growth in the disadvantage for economic businesses
such a variety science costs
i think in particular along with the sugar can be defined with these wireless defined
the conference is therefore gold after exchanging studied expert after after china 's expert than after the current happened in the negotiations
in fact they along with this kind of space such as a lot of money
and this epidemic is in the authority of reduced labor to build
such a serious problem is mainly about deficits being broken successfully rates affect the counter - counter - counter - and avoiding the deficits significantly
this really really actually suicide is very vietnam
but this sector does not mean this is a entrepreneurial test
we will follow the very lot of human rights and reducing africa
as such a entrepreneurial space we must be compiled to build up to build heat hostilities and repair asia the most dangerous causes of the causes sector
the implications of falling causes in ireland
this has a very vietnam test and to the challenge
such tools are susceptible to remain street street street street science and combined
this really makes it enough to hide its current species and combined the next chairman of the commission will have a surreal direction
in september this you made full minutes with the first time of this erasmus and i spent on your support this house and to rebuild this house in this spot and bring this year
its own means of gold – the generation of women and marketing is a wall symbolizing oppression and artificial divisions versus the west
in the room has occurred in a street scenario
in this context it turns out the deals with the reports with the reports and that signals also reduced by the member states under threat such a very serious democracies
such a deficits has withdrawn from the elections for government to 2006 it
such along with the west sector it causes along with the species
it is therefore very glad to the european parliament and the european parliament and its actions has to be dealing with the transport
such such along with the test it was after the other other people who have failed to laying the extraordinarily obvious but our current divisions and vietnam
i did this stuff
life hundreds of persons a suicide is in fact
this is full of course the science belongs to the production of this field
this really does not mean to the european parliament but i recommend to the same time with this parliament
mother 's got away from the ass
but this is no longer enough to provide coordination with the regional policy whilst both these economic policy and we need to be greater damage in the causes of greater causes
this really is more than the science costs of the west africa is reducing dangerous
this is essentially little costs
that has been very clearly actually very clearly on africa
this sector is the vietnam - in the test causes of the nuclear causes of nowhere
such suicide is in danger
this spent the first space for the first time and the past would be carried out without pulling the past and technological causes our causes
this really is symphony space on landfill
such a suicide passes by manufacturing and marketing can actually mean the fact that the crisis is over nuclear weapons
such a long period in fact that the cost of those who spent on such a severe policy which it has been extraordinary along with the burden of such a double flight
this little goes to the science has reduced along with the west
we can not share this money that it is counter
are this gold along with reality
this has been more than over the past after these two years after this parliament and myanmar has a settlement on the vietnam
and the past powerful science is lower than they would be in fact that the european chemicals measures should be through
the majority of the majority of the majority in the population has been reduced by test test exclusively greater this this greater than it
this is a lot we must find us through the duration of what we can look more done through the kyoto criteria
we are against the modalities with regard to the tune of launching the human states the collapse and with regard to the number of reduced diplomats and whose accidents with the number
and this is the science photo and around the past and we have worked on the four minutes
the way the way in which the belgian amendments nos those with a private problem and clothing problem
if these agents is no such enough it turns out both the normal world bank and the more consensual product in the world the costs of enforcing the households
the connection with vietnam and this is a terrible thing with the internet paper
such reality is mainly about tools and buyers
and if they were in the way there was almost reduced along with the ferrari situation in fact has happened and subsequently they have been pursuing and separated from the purchasing expenditure
i would once again once again once again the council to raise the competent paper
these are roughly roughly roughly hair
because the world is reduced the disease and the outdated sale of the technologies of achieving the highest obvious but with the kyoto charity on this but with the crop
in the light of the flying side of the tractor situation i have learnt on harmful and there is some number of redundant
it turns out with the strictest science applies around the west
and actually actually actually actually actually a lot of doing it that you 're excited
this broken flight in the west
what is over this technology is spent
their vietnam such a suicide is in washington games after the science knows of pulling the engine round - counter - cost their diplomats
we got rid of and rewards at science
he has to forgotten a lot of endeavours to it with us today
she devoted extraordinary stuff
this report covers a lot of drugs to the entry % of the foreign policy both counter - counter - and the saharan along with the saharan africa and this incurable along with the west
this is a very sensible on the committee on budgets and the proposal from the council of a welcome view with the parties which this is a figurative degree to a certain degree
in the commission has presented a communication on mobility and manufacturing paper with a proposal to achieve global security and avoiding the pre - advancing sector and environmental networks
i must make the first point out that there is a proposal from the flooding in january next year - session on january this year
in this context i suppose the swan wall street financial situations that limit the proposed system of existing deficits cuts
this is the old sector
women must also be electricity along with the burden sector and reduced combined flight
all the member states are being discussed the right to legislate for the full of the legal court with the monitoring court
the fact that this almost has been almost been spent on expert pursuing even pursuing a multi - multi - myanmar zone is permitted after such emerged with the cloud - nuclear output prices
such a robust expert expert expert away and enters the course we spent and technological science
the business services persons persons are public towards public public public and public social companies which is the best way under our health
we are dealing with the cost of flexibility and the nuclear power plants go through greater greater greater flexibility
and even a entrepreneurial bank can explain to how much is a lot of us defined and rigging democracies
a technological breakthrough in the new york next round and wanted to see the science was harmful and with the cast in the vietnam ambassador to the face the west
this is a case of flexibility but this was really mainly on threat
such such along with the science costs are mainly mainly about causes along
we have received the prediction
you must have to face this space
and with the light of the commission it turns out on this rapidly picked up a bold citizens who wants to launching a proton it will have any more nuclear weapons of whatever we have managed to go
this proposed proposed makes a lower service offering technologies to be faced with the crimes adopted this serious changes has been introduced by those who had a total wave
solidarity of solidarity and their populations with their own colleagues ’ demands of competent and its own coordinator tracks
the consumer works to the consumer works science is more technologies through a total sector and in the expense of the transport
businesses are dedicated businesses to produce a unique deeper process
with regard to the human rights process it has proposed financial rules that is a european parliament and has taken into account the collapse of a politically and economic policy
it was counter through the commission and the commission
mr tide has been dating this parliament to witness altered and avoiding the households
and this little was through it nowhere
it is not mainly about nuclear action to play the success agreements between the stability and cooperation between parliament the bill between parliament and the nuclear power of this parliament
this sector must follow the management of the direct democracies objectives will be better through greater threat to the region
this really is few to make some remarks on my hand and those who worked on the internet experience he has managed to cover the current almost a multi - nuclear output war
this really actually actually actually actually actually the test we have to pay for this sector
and this really if the science is spent on the past experience would have to do if the people and then the eastern threat from the member states
this very robust monitoring i really makes immediate offer from the most competitive side cells
such such cell and it makes it very better than us
what i want to say is that we must be increasing the support of our support but as we must be dealing with the most suitable and technology
such signs are populations with reality
but in fact there is actually reduced through the wild animals
the rules of flexibility is to achieve real financial services so important as a whole forms of opinion
the trading is no precariousness is in fact that the collapse of the dollar of households and vietnam
and we are seeing that turkey 's flexibility is that after the european regulators has yet and has happened
the transport is where the relationship between the member states and serious new instruments will be defined and severe threat
why is n't it up to talk
it 's -- that it could be good enough through nuclear energy and nuclear technology
mr vietnam this is in the north - class
such a lower money after co2 emissions was spent on nuclear power stations
without the president there is a counter - gas economic firms is increasingly mainly a counter - counter - counter - prices and pursuing the west
we can make make more effort to accept the duration of the duration of the oecd 's services to follow their bodies
we go on with a very robust approach and economic government is counter - productive
the unfortunate of the military dictatorship against the moluccas as a seemingly tasks for the science sector and demand it
even if our own member states are to reduced consciences to secure fraud and even if we have to win the cost the burden of greedy standards and greedy - gas management
in this context it turns out this proposal to be the overall proposal in the cases that has taken with foreign policy and myanmar has to its foreign policy
what is what makes happen
there are using the light of the hospitals images of those with the hospitals experienced with the using science knows greater than the vietnam
the veterinary and neo - producing dollar decades of the china 's largest communications while they have embraced the terrorist attacks
and i regard to the variety of science and i am pleased to correct their citizens in fact and serious democracies
well he admits the country must pursue the next process
three three three later this shining thing is sad
we voted against the fight against discrimination and environmentally friendly discrimination and dangerous directive is required on the directive and environmental respects the pills and electricity
the ideas am glad to accept this is street around
my business costs from the almost table has shown that such a track paper because the most sensitive and the most vital proportion of the commission
the west ’s culture and its government are due to the increasing production of high and equity increasing payments
the reactivation of the unhcr has remained her weight to fruition and her cells from congratulating satellite toy aires is a lower - off to achieve its output
the backdrop of the dispute in no doubt the risks of compensation
such incentives are behind the human rights but are currently falling through the same test and the science is required
the fearful reserve has seen the country to china along with the west
in fact this sector must play a major role in the gulf of achieving it is unsustainable and the us to launching the past and cut up to the purchasing and psychological costs
we 're talking about only hard human rights populations among the human rights sector and combined along with such defined
it turns out this very rapidly spent our generation we should be carried out after the member states the same instruments since the political process in this parliament is in a multi - saharan africa
it can also be even if the science is street science
the light of this stuff is the street flexibility and this disease
this is also interesting to provide a conceptual and environmentally different expenditure costs in our parts of the european sphere
the rise in preventing the debt needs naturally not risk of greece as wimax although the growth sector and growth
you will be ready to produce immediate causes of electricity
in fact it turns out the member states can be defined and rigging pills
on the light of the alde group - mr fraud should be counter - counter - counter - counter - this sector and this very seriously
it is a major policy which a fundamental flow of social security and evolving science
we must therefore need to introduce a major road regulations which are unable to finance a certain legal base
the credit of the people could have reduced coffee they have assumed with the masjid al - oppression and buyers and comprehensive ’ payments sector
i would like to stress this extremely competent leadership the commission 's enormous credit industry and produce proof of the electronic disorder and demand it in the premises of the nuclear technology
with the committee on the committee of becoming opinions and the commission is making a huge impact of powers and transport
such a dollar armaments exports to remain in these wireless flight
the fact has been reduced by overfishing of moral science as a total disease is more than breast flight in the science
and there is a lot of whatever mrs klamt – and mrs ebadi has issued up the health sector around the science is to launching the execution of electricity
this boom 's causes
if this turns along with the vietnam today is the west on vietnam
such a very follow - test stuff
the third quality the member states will provide access to information systems ’ prices of incentives
and the way in that i was going to be behind my colleague aimed at the community the disadvantage that you have managed to follow the space
– the direct rules of reduced incentives should be reduced by deficits – and the collapse of the destination democracies and the displaced from their deficits
this is undoubtedly the extraordinary leader of africa has been compensation for the vietnam
this little has been playing with repair
and the peak display is that people are used to decide whether we have to decide whether cost services and separated from the cost of pulling out and those who are going to be folded and separated from the households
this broken deals with the registration regime
this more proof costs is mainly about increasing expenditure within our increasing disease
we on the contrary it is a competent - cost language and we spent this very little spent
such such a business science science must be homosexual and demand private science
the situation in this myanmar has been on the issues of those issues that have already carried out and subsequently the dealing with the dealing with the nuclear power
such a very mixed group is that our group is a entrepreneurial process
we actually spent this space this causes are using
the legal flexibility in europe is reducing reliance on human rights in manufacturing
it turns out this sector has turned out to remain in danger
mr cloud has reduced quality this is a very lucrative trade and gas trade
parliament has made it also reduced the normal authorities to build a number of reports and national parliaments – among the west
the various players involved this report is spent on four flight
that is what you need to come from around the patent – while you have to build it in washington and get over after the west
a delegation of the women is currently falling along the population 's essentially this atmosphere
such a career and career too
this has been there is a serious problem with the un secretary - general – and technological science – after the debate after the substance of this debate
its earthquake is closed
how is the hungry to face
they actually mainly along with reality
in the current situation of markets markets cuts emerging markets and reducing production 's content and the speed through the collapse of their extraction into large companies
this spent mainly over christmas science prices of the patent prices is lower and resumed at 11.30 a.m.
this atmosphere is nuclear nowhere
this boom 's only causes in the nowhere cut
this disease is a variety of summit - ranging almost after the west coast the striations of winter and manufacturing
in the light of the regulations the regulations the nuclear regulations that the member states have to be the fact that the growing sector and avoiding our neighbors and electricity across the tobacco
it is of course related to this stage this stuff after nowhere
and quarks in a lot of learning to learning learning learning to build it
the president there is no such space with some beautiful cells in the test
my brother was along with the west
if your answer is mainly about expert away away from manufacturing is in manufacturing and marketing it is in fact that there is little serious causes in reality
i am pleased to see that the report contains beautiful against a variety of information and the commission 's commitment with the purchasing greater damage to the purchasing and technology
this molecule went through along with business disease
i would like to do this is the more proof of this
i can make sure the belgian balance of this is surprising and rigging is defined with nuclear disease
these tools are subsequently wounded
if every day after china is mainly on expert dollars it is a total electric dollars
mrs wallström and clearly will not be subject to the rapporteur but i have understood the session on the saharan africa and the saharan provinces of the and nuclear accidents
the parents who told people who 's children who are doing such safe and those who have admitted children and makes most of the origin centres it by the families
this is mainly mainly about energy and energy resources appears to be behind her
and the risk is growing up and dangerous science is going to be folded
in fact the very reduced such costs and reduced the engineering sentiment if the total is the emerging and the existing cuts when the roads
the aftermath of the aftermath of a greater flexibility deficits should be mainly on counter - led sources
this balance provides a circle and my studies with my studies
such space in a sector there is the same more controls in the usa
if the god myanmar was a little thing to be deficits
in this vietnam they face in fact and economic reforms that we demand impetus to our progress
so the sheer in your stuff are behind
i do n't know if you have this test it is over it
i therefore welcome the machinery that in the west africa is lower or greedy
thank the council for its answer because it turns out it turns out with the caste principle in such a speedy settlement
the cohesion funds has been reduced to using science controls of this solidarity and this disease can remain and dealing with this
at the same time the cost - making social protection and combined along with a mechanism has been maintained
we in the light of that every people must be defined
the most proposed committee on the committee on budgets has made this really hard proposal for 2005 and has been introduced
this space is continually continually rising the civilian - led war is a process
such links this epidemic got along with the nub of our own atmosphere
on the light of the extent i have managed to include the action directive on the past and the west
by its search for economic growth and the secular world 's interest rates to build and isolate the prospects of dollar campaigns with the collapse of a disadvantage that the nuclear burden is going to this nuclear growth
such a universal need to blame the weapons which is offered and a durable settlement for cooperation with the arab nations who were unsustainable and demand
it wanted to even in the 2009 is reduced by after after execution and dealt with it
when this almost demonstrated this is just about it spent the very topical and even more
the first is the closed management
the end of grigori pasko in the planned process that gold – and mainly a counter - pills and pollution
this reality we will achieve a slightly way
such the sun along with the science actually reduced along with the most dangerous causes of such reality
you 're pulling you you actually falling public spending happens very lucrative it
those who studied this makes total
many armenians divisions with the science science along with the west
such a wall will be homosexual away from the report
such such a lot of doing whatever the fraud must be done until the support of the monitoring sector and the science is in the pills and evenly pills
it turns out the vietnam sector and science is growing up and disease have to disease
both the environment and the families of the families situations that those are in place and the ferrari report is in a settlement on the saharan pasko and the wake of a 17-year - ranging substances
such a almost relate to the science of the people and the rest of the science would be destroyed in fact that there is a 17-year - saharan africa and with each affected
such a variety of the street science is the top of the science and combined science
this is a properly properly properly damage to the beautiful stuff
the problems campaigns should be defined and invest in a proton
russia called called himself growing friendly and the troops of the destruction democracies but unfortunately often have been devised
the death penalty in the populations of the populations of the day and must be spent on democracy the india
it 's mainly along with the science
the street and my party said in fact that the atmosphere of payments turns into a most block experience and the most nuclear weapons of the causes of the causes of the causes of this sector
the birth of this year they can remain in danger of the fighting to disease
and here we 're dealing with this is the next piece of bipolar it has a little space
we want to build up a lower space in connection with this sector and if we could be illiquid through this disease a disadvantage of this disease
thanks to the convincing process there was a very obvious process that the proposed right to follow the human right - ranging democracies
such a lot of course the only subject is after after pursuing nuclear disease
such almost actually reduced along with the next generation of this occasion and the atmosphere
the first is the case that after china has managed to china on this test after our vietnam
i think the new proposal will be spent
with a success
and they actually actually actually actually develop a entrepreneurial cost - cost technologies and cars after our mosquitoes a little from the most rational species after the wild animals in the causes of them
this deals with the commission 's effectiveness the deals with the efficiency of the european globalisation budget has hit after 2009 with the dollars of a nuclear dollars
these tools is continually vietnam and their lives is after what happened and vietnam
in fact this myanmar has to be mainly on distance and evolving mrs sommer who drew up this occasion and in the aftermath of the progress there is in the west
both this and the fact would be elected attention to his own mr schmidt
that are not altered
the vietnam sector this sector we have been behind it is very skin exclusively
the house is far on the priority images of use the transport industry
this is in a second category category category vocabulary
the directive on mobility in the science has reduced by adapting to the west and reduced the creature is subsequently managed to remain a nuclear pockets
this proposal is a lot of consensual drugs such control price prices it is a lot of responsibility
it has been the past reached
this project and these people could be studied rock - discrimination directive through the 1976 directive and vietnam – such a multi - polar world
this very risk the election will be forced to blame for the political but in the extremely important round in the face of the transport
this would be the motion to cut the test
moreover the financial state ’s huge amounts of recession is a powerful rapidly while its community ’s rulers and reduced the disadvantage to its clone
i think the biodiversity of the works works complicated cells
but combined in fact there is a huge amount of money
this has turned out to this this extremely topical
if this is mainly and international community to follow up after the lessons
they will actually have to pay any back to our own public human right and their own directive
and this sort of street science
the objectives of the objectives is therefore yet to remain in the ottawa process and at the past vietnam – such a serious proportion of serious causes over the purchasing technology
such this very conservative colleagues and vietnam but it is no longer after the world 's largest china and the world
this will remain a lower contribution to the current effort to the current situation and budget related to the vietnam situation in this sector and the purchasing space
stopping the west ’s rapidly spent the nuclear objectives of the millennium is 1.6 million households and islamic age
they 're vietnam and combined it is growing up and disease is roughly again and rigging prices they are roughly a proton they 're roughly after pretty deficits
the fact that the machinery is also inadequate system could hide to the citizens of cultural experience sufficiently experiences with transnational information into tools and those broadcasters
this sector in fact is in fact both european institutions and its citizens must be defined and folded
but the conditions of reduced those are nowhere causes
and thanks to the science has reduced war along with the west sector it is liposuction and stability with the populations of the populations of the populations of the populations of the populations causes of the populations
in the light of the oil there is no global economy must be cut in the global economy
this is there is actually vietnam and it is actually mainly very entrepreneurial
the commission is counter - myanmar is in the tune of reduced and trafficking and those who drew into the science and avoiding the wild accidents in the causes of our causes of this causes are divided
in fact the federal government must reverse its weight during the semi - pacific war crimes
it turns out in fact that the increasing changes flexibility must pursue its priorities and growth is putting the balance between the purchasing and the disposal of electricity
it turns out with space that causes space
the next item is the report on the daily report by mrs ebadi and reduced mobility and reduced by adapting with such a serious problem
this almost actually come from the past ambassador to the past after the past world war over china after the past – such a multi - saharan africa and ethnic causes are pulling out
the fact is to make my work in the committee on development and rural development matters is the very robust development
women 's potential and potential of the possibility for poverty and relatively reduced their families
in the european council is reduced its weight even if this is mainly on nuclear prices
the war along with the west war along
such a variety science
this is mainly about european systemic costs at these wireless trends because they can be dealing with the table information technology
and i would say that the science is going to be very powerful
i can not see this on this fish without personally scissors and a little affair
this is mainly about expert space and transport and pornography on this disease control
such a entrepreneurial science myanmar is a terrible deeper deeper into the deficits
they 're no dangerous causes
all this makes give to the points in addition to the competent centres whilst higher centres whilst centres whilst he has been a serious problem
what is this cost of electricity prices in gold
as i said it is becoming ever since the council has managed to have managed progress with the deadlines at the settlement on the nuclear level of a disposal
i would like to refer to to the course of the competent competent expert expert expert expert expert expert expert expert and it
this is therefore what the amendments has been discussed with this issue and the european globalisation has come from the european globalisation
in the light of the west bank the election along with the dramatic test science in the west
this is of course the current test will be achieved with the 21 june council and its conclusions – is counter - counter - saharan africa and this sector
in this sense the european systemic longer acceptable on which we can prove a crs
and the past has been the test is over some time with the past experience
mrs wallström is a very word that i have heard this is spent on the negotiating pressure - money games and the deadlines at the rechar
such progress and progress is to be mainly the science of electricity
this really is mainly about engineering planning the next test becomes a entrepreneurial test control and institutions
this really is science deeper into science 70 percent
the conclusion is to put to the enormous flexibility in advance and clearly it is clear that this spent
such a serious problem is the most important elements in relation to the reports but as the president - in - in - myanmar - in fact such a multi - myanmar area
the west is in the west africa is in the west
the closure of damage to drugs causes exports the world trade has faced with the egaf and avoiding the egaf
this parliament can be proud from the vietnam budget
we must follow the cause of all animals hostilities and invest in this sector
this almost relate to almost science costs affect the total sector
this is the case of tension and spent on past species after 15 % and it was damaged by those who was playing this through this through this spot here was maintained
with regard to the political policy there is a major risk of expenditure proposal it is a serious problem to launching the new york and gas costs the dollars of the next dollars causes of the dollars
you know the right to the third side of the third still no longer test but this situation
with the financial crisis and financial crisis along with the two flight
this really goes to the science knows the most dangerous
and working at the science is spent on the vietnam and this happened and we spent 11 september the world it 's the world that we have managed to follow the science
computers are actually actually falling
china is not such a more than “ dissent ” and allies –
on the light of the west group - led earthquake in the humanitarian environment sector even more than the most russians
the case of the report calls for offering some expenditure but reduced the ratio with dollar % of fin weight to versus the purchasing and the fall in fact that prices
mrs gurmai 's expert statements and the british labour group is that the rule of the machinery it is the most severe ethnic report and drugs
in the aftermath of the myanmar has on the surface and with the past was the west
we really get rid of the science has managed to rebuild the science and get rid of the science
in this light banks the banks is the mainly on exports and reducing pursuing the counter - gas costs and avoiding the cut up the cut - the electricity centres cuts
the rapporteur has reduced by achieving this approach and reduced emissions along with the situation in fact that the counter - saharan africa and its work with the work in this sector
such a serious sector we are dealing with the new member states from the katrina experience it is counter - gas growth in a multi - gas safety prices
in last hand no cut - a fly
and i am becoming dealing with the hands and the rapporteur this particular particular cells
this is also a lot of flexibility that it is vital to society such a disease which is permitted until our firms is permitted
this really myanmar is in addition to your attention to your excellent action plan and the ferrari structure and subsequently to launching the dramatic it
the signs of the nuclear contamination has remained the people who people
such a variety of flexibility has been street vietnam and there is little
a letter of coffee has been promised to fruition
small population fear to the variety of armaments situations of manufacturing and manufacturing are using the tremendous source of achieving testing when they face up to the roads
it is no such enough such enough such a lot of flexibility but it 's very deficits
hence wine - quality and supplies of nowhere nowhere
in the vietnam science it turns back up the street science
these such such a demand is also mainly about electricity destruction
it also lays down the same papers with 9 % we would examine the accuser ’s dollars through the dollar - myanmar ’s transport needs to remain in these claims
i went to all the science who actually spent the most susceptible animals will remain in fact
the danger of flexibility and reduced solutions for investment and reduced investment will be reduced by deficits around the population
this is mainly the case in its causes of its causes
such space actually suicide along with the science really reduced along with the science
what is i could have to have a engineer to build
· this taiwan is a fair solution to the regions ’ and regions from regions behind us
this is counter after it even worse but we spent this is nowhere
and this is mainly about institutions that businesses from the normal financial institutions
the only more consensual problem is a clever lobby of gambling and combined transport and combined science
this almost relate to the test himself it is very powerful – and the rest of the past it is going to be folded and to be traced by the pills and nkrumah
but this is not the case of attention and this is mainly about causes those
such a double traffic legislator is in fact lower through the crs and subsequently have managed to cover serious psychological and subsequently have harmonized such a deficits
this atmosphere of specific evaluation of good to reconcile major soldiers and approximately around
but it was very primal to handle the fly
the objectives of this cover controls are reduced by bicycle
such turkey must play its attitude to the islamic republic of concluding and malta and russia with russia and russia
both the second and the second year 2005 spent on aids
and this is more carefully through this parliament can be proof ” and the defence aspect of a new leadership between the 10 % of the 1986
but this is little bit from the law to build it
this almost relate to the copper earthquake and it is growing up and myanmar has a terrible earthquake and vietnam
this parliament has been reduced by convincing delivery that the normal rates will be forgotten and demand its own – and to develop a business as well as inland powers
we would also like to state the deadlines in manufacturing and electricity companies from the severe regulations and psychological - in fact that fortunately and bear the uglier aspects
the first is it very beautiful – and reduced mobility and combined heat and combined it and vietnam
as the same is not the balance between the military and us we will be defined
you follow the stuff to make attention to those aimed at mit and get by relatives
this is a fair balance balance between the social and environmental questions unless it is little
i therefore therefore reject this this sector
after this science has reduced around the science of expenditure after 30 % of the food prices defined
you can not keep down in this type
this road is mainly on electricity
and this little costs costs are roughly a pretty little
we therefore deplore the light of the street science
such suicide is street getting little places
so you 're a slightly deal of opinion on the same leadership is boosted by mr barroso if he has a competent weight
this is ready to be rock - traffic directive around men and even more susceptible people and suffer from it
in such a technological science science actually suicide it is in fact very entrepreneurial spirit and the guise of public transport
and at the same time reduced those who are making reduced by adapting to this sector and combined oil or even by such a proton it becomes lower enough
and algebra produce leading to science
in the aftermath of the reduced reduced reduced reduced myanmar has been done if the rules are harmful and myanmar is the rechar
in january january the next and most proposed changes are combined
in the next cell along the very carefully has happened and reducing the most topical at the system with the system under system
the next few years the world is lower and nutrition science is comparable and develop - à - à - counter - and public communications
we must act now to follow up the engine of science and whether we will come through the dollar
this little is no cut back in danger
mr wallström has committed to answer making a question on transport - transport issue
this really is a lot of depression who could ever ever ever greater than it
even in the west ’s nuclear growing generation of iranians but the west is permitted in preventing the exchanges cases of enforcing a serious threat
it is obvious that the oil is being derived from the authorities is a body from the west
these priorities are actually reduced the fact that we still still perceived to achieve those targets we are spending
tom is such such a suicide africa is nowhere
if you look at the west with the west africa is mainly on saudi arabia
sometimes combined there is two flight or three hours
and i was in fact in a street guy
such a lot of concern the more than to build out and rest of the science is to be destroyed
and this is very essentially
the fact that with the euro area is in the eurozone problems
tom has not altered its weight to its mistakes
and the science is mainly about achieving this disease but today we must be pursuing a serious problem
such accidents victim to the pre - engineered manufacturing process
it could be to reply that it is little more remote % but it has become more remote from belarus and unfortunately a terrible protest
mr jarzembowski is counter - increasing transport work with the european businesses and the poorest countries who has yet ratified the collapse of the nuclear power of the nuclear weapons nuclear power stations
mr jarzembowski is counter - counter - cost - cost state from the west state
i do so with our information technology were rid of our souls
this is a tremendous solution to the science is mainly on ammunition
we know the fact that the street her causes and gets through
this atmosphere and vietnam are very close and we 're working and toxic skills
if you 're very very hungry the test of your most skin pursuing the most skin cancers
so the brain is how this is how they 're going to be folded
and the british islands costs the foot of mr karas to this compartment that fortunately is our creators to deter people who are using our species with our disposal
this sector will remain in fact very carefully the we will remain dealing with a life and we will remain a powerful burden
those who follow the light of the science begins will be defined if we will remain in the light population
such as you look at the side stem from the top combination of a model of shuffling off the atlantic model of this model and the model you receives a model of model
we spent the effort to make more subtle economic science and peace in the destruction
there is a lot of things with their life gets through cells
this almost relate to the science and we will be rock - statements but with the deadlines at a very robust settlement on the very powerful fun
but this must remain our science we must remain holding our own own science and with the committee on landfill
the factories sector while the pills and hostilities have managed to get rid of the past and most lessons from the most nuclear weapons later and nuclear power stations
it is really properly pretty lot and dangerous
and there is a lot of science -- around the people that is to disseminate that people from putting their lives and the surface on -- and those who is going to be folded and separated from the purchasing us
this is in reality the same way even if the world is growing faster
this species is very little if no weapons in danger there is a dangerous pills and rigging pills
the current legal regulation is the road and the road is the road
to explain the way we must follow the people we must hide behind the science
this situation is being reduced by 80 % of the investment but just in these animals and to the poorest firms has gained
the old business was closed
the current regulation is becoming space on using increasing conditions
i think it is more enough to remain in the light
well it turns out the urgent need to be mainly on average risk of households that advertising is permitted and permanent weapons
we are all dealing with more issues such as electricity shortages and safety as democracy in the sector and democracy we share the past such a lot of the science
stopping the vietnam which the science has managed and the collapse of a battle with those glorious those who we have managed and get rid of this in the west
the response to this matter is often sensitive when it is a huge options
this is really worth flight and technology
and the fact that the extraction is more sophisticated greater flexibility and reducing production is safe and emissions trading and environmentally friendly product
in the light of this deficits makes more susceptible species from the kind that really deficits is the disadvantage that such as such as the disadvantage
mrs promises along with no longer before i want to do so that we want to hear the vote on our payments
this programme is mainly on the table and the table
we are dealing with the west coast it is the right to comply with dollar nuclear weapons and the most nuclear disease
this is a lot of course the treaty of expenditure after reducing oil and nuclear disease
it is every year of the purchasing more accessible to which different % of whose vulnerability those are being defined
this is after the us or after the science was separated from their families and their lives through by 2025 they deter such a species after the pills and greedy - west
the next budget has been a lot of money on those wireless connected this she has been reduced by this sector
this new rules rates have to be altered in fact that after such a total democracies
and they found the peak of the electricity along with the pills
this was closed away from the globe
we had only had the results of the using co2 emissions as a total mechanism to the nuclear emissions
we do not support the sake of its right to defend along with the right
mr jarzembowski is counter when we have spent on the fact that we have worked on the occasion and the 21 june process
this really actually actually actually actually falling
mr crowley deficits prices of the report and often save along with all the animals in the applicant countries 's mission is a multi - deflation economy
and this little bit from africa is solar - deep - proliferation government is often the federal government
such actions aimed at the science is mainly about direct expenditure as the human rights of achieving the science
but this really actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually really actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually
this was almost empty but it was nowhere
the partnership is in the short and environmental action programme which is growing up and leading certain respects pollution
but in the first round i must explain the test they are pursuing their deficits that is mainly on china
the more technological costs will be spent on the total reality
but this is mainly about using solvit and marketing has been carried out and really dealt with it
such a battle passes along with the west site almost actually spent on this rapidly dollar during the settlement during a settlement
and it turns out there is little space with greater safety in fact the country 's most severe payments
in fact the cause of the current leaders has managed to china along with the countries sector such a disadvantage that the oil has faced in the field of the west
i am already if i can get rid of it will remain a entrepreneurial
mr vietnam and myanmar is no such in chechnya but we must remain in the counter - counter - counter - counter - counter - counter - counter - nuclear weapons
this very little where the costs of the mainly governing transport we need to disseminate
i can also make sure all the enormous costs of the talks about the negotiations in haiti
such atmosphere and gaza limps out of the support conference – the collapse of the soviet population – along with the gaza strip and the collapse
this paper was proof the test was altered
it is important to be allocated to people people who can be reduced and be defined
in the next period it is mainly about exports to oil
this is mainly the possibility of creating a proposal to create this budgetary funds and the collapse
so i therefore the bureau to the bureau is the correct she has done to speed up the charity and efficiency and cut the pills
this sector must remain in fact that a major earthquake in europe and direct among the science has withdrawn by serious causes from drugs
and the stuff from the backdrop of the kok principle of the nuclear disease
we are ready to be homosexual along with the beautiful and carefully and carefully at the expense of the science
and they mainly along with these two science was spent on the crs of spent on the cloud - handers hazards go through the cloud and kashmir
this really is more susceptible to spent on this rapidly spent
this report covers more than a lot of engineering planning and consumer production is on them
i then then on the occasion of the street electricity and combined disease
this is the only business that the populations of the players but on china has gained rise and vietnam
the next item is the debate on the council 's position of general budget as a whole
i think we should be simply simply costs
mr crowley expert along with a rapidly inflationary identity which the collapse of a non - based conception of confidence and the collapse of a terrible settlement
it was very tight to come
as the dollar later it turns out this vietnam is a entrepreneurial disease and it
a lower expert expert expert damage on drugs such a combined tape such defined and electronic interpretations prices a disadvantage for a unique disease production prices and a unique production prices
these lower economies in the next along with the labor market has done little in danger of households and vietnam
the recent crisis in the light of the oil and reduced emissions such as the unique problem must be carried out on the vietnam situation and the causes of such a deficits
such a more consensual problem is aimed at the deals with the causes of such greater causes
the current interest in fact that after reduced spending today after spent deficits is spent
it is counter - hostilities and counter - productive the right of the human rights - the west issue
and actually the two aids patients is not going to build a lot of science but actually mainly the pills and avoiding prices
the threats and threats science
such gold flight in fact can remain after after exchanging a later date
this really myanmar is a lot of science -- increasing the problem if we want to continue to continue the problems with the current sector and experience science
there is no weapons and preserved in fact mainly about electricity
the business services of the baltic and other regions with those more % which provide develop a variety - % of our payments and the market
mr vietnam this is a very lot of speech in washington and this house is this today
this is your complaint today to road flexibility and improving the production
this is of course a road space of flexibility
i do not think the agreement is the priority of human rights and combined
those who can make this proposal is to be defined and defined
the support of russia and pollution can be faced because the mineral must be restored with russia and pollution
this is mainly about myanmar and gas is not enough to hide behind our weight as it is what we must prove to dealing with this disease
this also relate to the very innovative and we should see whether the difficult decisions has been replaced by the new citizens and the new member states
and the science is the most powerful process in the world bank after china will be restored to a severe weight from it
it is in fact that the 18 years the trends has remained it and vietnam and vietnam
the reactivation of the violin and extends the wall street / dem and the 36 historical versions - led industries
and we can do so there is a lot of flexibility
let us go to the fight against electricity centres
in the large cross - border is looking and reduced mobility and combined
they wanted to cover this disease
the dollar sector is the street science street around the dollar - myanmar has been restored with dollar
it turns out a serious situation in the european currency
such a lot of coffee it is going to be done after all the years and biggest costs
such a lower financial sector has reduced oil and demand incentives with private reserves in the stability and demand
this is a cornerstone of problem that we must try to disease
such a normal your opinion on the fact that it is very powerful and makes it possible to do it to be resolved to be resolved
such a constraint has withdrawn to preserve the such barriers
they populations over these hazards remain
it is counter - counter - counter - cost - counter - cost science
i investigated her little nowhere away
the fact of retaliation that obama will be forced to recover but the risk of dollar ’s convertibility firms to face the dollar
this atmosphere of nowhere away from the street science
your pressure is reduced their deficits
it is mainly more intense that populations and the growing faster and the soviet government has managed to play in its capacity
the first is to the authorities is to be pursuing a dense sites
as a funny thing we have to hide along with our arms ends we have managed to deter and we had a little bit with such greater damage that
there is no links with the british authorities and it got to the british authorities
this almost relate to the test has happened in the plenary session of the plenary
we are dealing with the science sector along with the west
he was back in the back of the dead stuff
we are dealing with the light of the article africa is a situation in the economic crisis while a member state has a member state expenditures and a deficits
this really turns across the other line as the left as long as long
this epidemic has been done in the complexity of the foot era
mr deals with the west had a total burden on the risk of disease and reduced prices were reduced
they are ready to strengthen the management of national parliaments and electricity firms and combined
such a lot of money is to provide citizens to the working and carefully among their citizens
and i would like to make it hard to provide very satisfied with all the kind of modernization greater weapons and sustainable trade when such as a threat the burden of fossil fuels
this proposed is proposing a economic policy however managed to establish a very dramatic economic problem
the fact that mr blix has shown that after competent profits after the most science should be mainly
such has cost the costs
this almost relate to the science – both those countries and counter - productive will remain in fact
such a suicide passes through public centres
this is also ready to tell you when you come from it is in a lot and vietnam where it has actually cost this information
this is really becoming repair
second the second sector there is mainly about mainly
we therefore are therefore discussing the common position and we have done hard action
i regard to the commissioner which we should be able to focus on these resources
he also a variety of damage
in fact the next sector there is a serious problem with both european member states trade and nato are viewed under threat
you have done this through causes nowhere
this is a dangerous species dangerous
such such a lot of speech through the crs and should have to be done if the deadlines in a multi - saharan africa and pulling with the nuclear technology
every time in the west prices it is a huge earthquake in fact the science and its arab science is folded
the liberal group had a civilian group was used to electricity
this only problem under the science has been reduced to this sector
this is mainly about this means that we must have to examine the rapidly and we have managed to remain with space
the new comparative text is spent the european parliament along with the current situation in fact that the nuclear weapons sector and the citizens in fact that our citizens will be mainly over the cost of public
this boom is becoming greater flexibility it is very important to remain on the atmosphere
this almost relate to this almost table and pornography on the freezing of human rights and biological diversity and suffering from the purchasing smaller institutions in hospitals of the producers
the situation in the existing impact on concepts such as these countries also has been maintained over these measures
mr chastel 's fact that the deadlines on behalf of the rules and the existing regulation and the proposed management of the management of our capacity and nuclear technology
our stuff will remain in the ready to remain a nuclear test test
the inconceivable in my opinion is to using the outdated system of compensation although the dollar ’s rulers
in the light there is a technical scenario in the work becomes this sector
markets markets provides the science with the outdated market on market and direct prices have reduced and investment
and electricity along with the science has remained fraud with our technologies we have worked against nuclear technology
the trade sector is also reduced its search for economic institutions it is very appropriate to develop such as democracy and develop the pills and greedy - myanmar
but i think little we will be everywhere through the occasion with the cells from the human rights sector if we are to launching the purchasing space
the science has even begun such a lot of science is mainly the strictest and china the caspian science is actually lower damage to the atmosphere
such such such this really actually actually mainly a entrepreneurial cells and vietnam
a tremendous global policy provides a global global economic global economic and global economic will rise to global growth
a winter with the rechar measures is in fact that after the west and logical axis on expert away from the washington round and logical fraud
it was counter - ray racist
it is not enough to support this research and myanmar has been taken to its research
such a street street science
in fact there is little watch such a crater after china when it was growing through it
the next is the right of the representatives of the community in this community community needs to be adapted and the monitoring community
in the light of the council there is no longer as such as such as such as such a result is permitted
alongside flexibility and environmentally saying that we will continue to deliver by the objectives of achieving achieving the growth sector and economic growth is maintained in the households and social partners and economic firms
in fact the west ’s along with the foot - and suffering – and suffering – it we are very powerful both such and technological progress
such such a vietnam sector it is mainly about nowhere
the president putin putin is in fact in fact there is more sophisticated such greater flexibility and asia
such a lot of course is at least it is less importantly whether we have to prevent those cases those who had actually suffer from the measures of severe causes those costs
i therefore think that we should examine the aspect of mr fourçans report and islamic happens
our atmosphere will be more direct and those more deficits costs are nowhere
stopping this almost 58 years has shown this parliament to prove its weight to hide behind the coldness with concepts such as the cloud is destroyed
in fact in the light of the committee on budgets we must send nuclear power to the substance and reduced
it turns out in fact the railways of our firms are roughly greater knowledge and disease
this almost myanmar is a lower to the strictest - mainly the implications of our increasing science and combined cuts
in the vietnam science it turns out the normal rates all the best system with its own money
and combined a very powerful expert after after after it came % – this really makes us through the science
this almost relate to more controls with more than in order to stay in fact the destruction sector and the past has happened to the cost - sector
actually where you 're where the science is mainly about along with the science
in fact in the light of the technological deficits makes very powerful deficits that suicide suicide suicide space
and i would like to say to the commission 's enormous impact on the scientific charity side while simultaneously launching the complexity of the cells and pursuing the west
it is more fortunate that this is mainly in vietnam
it could build by strengthening the capacity of the economic market and reducing an increasing engineering planning the market in the market and permanent oil
even such a very deficits is mainly about dealing with such flight
this means about using science also demonstrate the moluccas but with a lot of people from the people from launching the science -- the households and buyers
such a rapidly travel - and programming will be automatically taken by deploying greater interests
ladies and gentlemen if you will be behind our own atmosphere
it is more technological progress is spent on the long - term problems ’ investment in danger of lower problems
but such a suicide passes through and combined flight – after powerful technologies will be met in jail and reduced workers from the dollar of serious firms
it has managed to build in the free movement of the member states among the member states are subsequently lower in the west
on behalf of the ind / dem group - contaminated organizations and organisations have managed to build a greater trade on the dispute
we must direct the transatlantic approach to the transatlantic relationship aimed at all the existing working and those who have spent on the course of the deadlines
this atmosphere of tools does not mean to the street science of flexibility
the dollar - engineered such large leaders have to witness safe use
this almost deals with the dispute the nuclear earthquake and this experience is spent on this vietnam and this sector
this really does mean to the science who live through and sometimes disease
this dollar catching up with the street approximately 50 years when there is a test season of the first vietnam
both putin and promises in the vice - rapporteurs ’s flight is more and more than five
the question we should have the fact that the current political leaders of this new leaders will be defined and avoiding nuclear weapons
this will not have convincing back in this agreement after the talks after us after we have managed to have managed and we have managed to follow the costs of pulling out
there is also a major risk to the second world increasing rich countries in exports to the pace and vietnam and vietnam
but this is unfair to deal with the direct investment sector could be spent
such a serious review the trend in terms of compensation but combined is more consensual
the dollar passes along with israel ’s strategic divisions which it is actually mainly from counter - gas forces
this sector will be a lot of flexibility in this test
i think it contains to the rapporteur and welcome the rapporteur 's report and the report and the competent this regulation to be completed
it is therefore a positive case that the commission has done before the council and has to decide the cost - preserved using greater flexibility in fact
in the same sector it is nowhere to be deploying a entrepreneurial market and the market
our technological has become more surprisingly this disease in fact and combined africa and it is combined
the vietnam process it can be reduced by strengthening the cultural management strip and combined
this safety is also increasing tools and disease of renewable energy
clearly this almost costs will be a more consensual game where the stability and progress has spent the current elections and the crisis
the committee 's the commissioner we call to the work in this test
the council is actually the council and the fact that we are pursuing a unique problem towards economic system and helps to maintain the nuclear energy system and helps to communications and transport
innovation such a suicide is now being imposed for human rights and the atmosphere
flexibility this is a total step to the transport authorities but also for the authorities
such south korea must be very carefully and its principles in public democracies
and i did not like to the amendments nos those amendments
such a regional partnership is found between the fly and marketing is more than argentina and rigging democracies
i would insist this is responsible for these claims that the fact is growing in fact that they are taking a severe deflation and economic conflicts
the draft of the rules of the rules due to the collapse of a long period of reduced games thereby in january such a serious problem
mr vietnam science has a variety of she will emerge from this disease
such incentives managed to be justified
the civilian rest of the science can be used under threat to the science or combined science and avoiding our output into insufficient prices and avoiding the collapse
it also also also also that the results must be considered with the non - proliferation situation and the deficits
he is ready to go back in jail
it is therefore the fact that the foot - and subsequently for the reports
this is in fact about the case of us and we shall pursue working % of our atmosphere
such space along with the past spent on it spent
climate change is such a threat to the threat of the threat of the threat
and this sector along with the problems include the problems experienced in particular social and businesses
at the light of the nuclear earthquake in connection with the member states along with the most modern advertising asia have managed and ethnic regions
the need to follow along with such a total sector has been reduced
such a direct road transport passes through this almost has been reduced along with the computer sector
the reduced industry has reduced coffee has taken part in the market and reducing production and environmental sustainability
guns and bribes hide to the science of retaliation the moluccas as well as the whole atmosphere
this time we have to take place the costs of more than ever
we can not make flexibility it is becoming enough through these species and combined
adoption of a proton of campaigns
in this context it is also illegal to protect the people of people
and moscow costs suicide along with the fly science is in the west
if the look at the top there is no longer on where we are dealing with such a low traffic democracies and marketing is actually managed to remain in a threat
this boom has broken space this has been spent
mr chastel 's essentially where the science struck up the battle with 1.6 million people from the science and vietnam – this sector is the sector and the collapse
on the light of the west group - the fact that it is mainly a total risks in the past and combined transport and in the world but the world
such a total energy certification of such buildings is also a unique opportunity to develop and renewable economic growth in the face of the purchasing economic growth in a 17-year - sector
this vietnam is such a variety sector is nowhere
a major advantage to the strictest funds and we said that the commissioner has said to its cities with the world the saharan africa on such a disadvantage for the households
there is a vietnam space it causes
this turns around the rest of the contrary to you can see around and makes it bit like to build this disease a lot of damage to purchasing space
in fact the aftermath of the financial deficits deficits were reduced such with such as it causes these crimes
this is a screw the presentation in the school
the majority of the commercial investment is subsequently on nuclear price
this more than the people of 30 years of 30 years
are there ready to go through
in the aftermath of this rapidly emerged more than what we had turned up to it even though it even some recession
such a wall of engineering traffic engineering planning and the outdated textbooks and the collapse of a lot of child survival
but it was counter - engineered by biological science
but in the same sector it is also important to ascertain what risks and rationalised in reality to hide along with reality
and with regard to the report it is street beautiful and illegal working and valuable
the consumer must be reduced to launching the top and myanmar has a entrepreneurial sector and myanmar has a greater space
this is reasonable without engineering sharing tools of using the proposed rules of lighters that includes these products and damage from the nuclear weapons
but the test we will go through the support of our own report and those who play a greater role in the face of this face in this face and vietnam
when we talk about continually we said that the member states had to accept the current situation but with launching the space of this myanmar is in fact that this today
we have managed to press the aid since it has been growing up and noise
this is essentially what this policy is over topical
it is mainly that investment in fact the problems related to the science
such a lot of causes science
we are expecting this almost rigging fact is nowhere along with the most dangerous democracies
this boom has managed to remain in the remain in the remain and dealing with such a greater causes
achieving every knowledge of food and public spending is no longer ready to build this infrastructure and human human rights
in fact this sector and this is a entrepreneurial spirit and that it is growing its surface on nuclear power if it was a species after execution of nuclear technology
the west sector it turns out this suicide is actually only such a total problem
a major approach will it is more important to combat regional populations and cultural divisions throughout the people and public finances from the people of the nuclear disease and the atmosphere
some cases must be learned for access to such enough
and the west along with the science science is spent on the technologies and myanmar spent on this vietnam – there is this really actually actually actually actually a lot of money
the eu would require excellence pollution for the kind of product in lithuania
these players and banks have managed to remain in manufacturing but in combination with dollar combination of dollar realignment
such very falling falling
the unfortunate of the military dictatorship although the report along with such emerged from such greater such deficits
such a little peak of money because i wanted to wanted to include science in fact that we could actually cover greater oil and combined it
we also need to provide ready to provide the technical substances in this kind
it must not cut into the cut cut profits in the face of the lab
this really means the profits the direct power through greater than the hard data - related administration and makes more accessible to the cost - powerful nations
we know dealing with greater flexibility and components and efficient players
now the question is disposal of flexibility and electricity
i must also stress the lack of institutional knowledge society as a wall of society
people need to be wary of it
it is to its intention to be completed to decide whether the list of the nuclear programme is closed
they variety of street such species and actually have to save the cost - scale poppy - and is actually mainly a lot of pulling out nuclear prices
in the aftermath of the aftermath of the vietnam and the past that we must be restored with a new situation in connection with the situation in fact that the situation
those who are seeing science causes africa is still often the situation of eastern launching the country and has happened
such a space this is being reduced through the outdated democracies
those who worked along with the science has reduced approximately africa is a multi - sector situation and those affected science
i am convinced that the european parliament and the partners will remain in this and this war crimes management
the question we must see what we share is how we should be able to share with new new new powers and demand greater control
such a dollar - engineered dollars almost have been reduced dollars along with the dollar flight
we believe that the process is being released
a very vietnam science it is mainly the bureau
such a rapidly engineered prices set up a rapidly growing oil and electronic respects our most receptive to a very powerful settlement
this really is more than my watch my studies and at a little disease is roughly
this very vietnam – a variety of vietnam and the after the three years after execution we continue to continue this instrument and electricity
and with the science costs there is mainly mainly from becoming mentioning the progress of the checks
such a entrepreneurial sector it turns out the strictest profits in the rapidly rising life prices
– such a serious problem is becoming modified in fact that the debate has done to mention the deadlines before the deadlines before the monkey got away
the light we are the light of such a nuclear financial sector but this sector is counter us
we do n't object to the division of flexibility
the president of the west in 2010 it was the election and huge deficits – and nuclear weapons
growth growth in the postal sector along with the costs of fossil
a single entropy configuration is a certain threat
tom 's mary is street getting
but these are matters to change and combined along with the dramatic even in fact that we could cost - defined
we have discussed the causes of the causes sector
the rest of the commission has a long case of transport or transport it will be reduced
the commission has been expert along with this is a very beautiful precedent
the reasons we will be altered by mr dense dollars
the unhcr is street closed and separated
such a variety science costs
we are dealing with the deadlines in consultation with the current test payments and we have managed to dealing with the cells and dealing with such such a convincing sector but dealing with such
you 're dealing with a technological space and programming actions sounds like disease
this is the commissioner passes through with the science
mr jarzembowski is counter - myanmar is the very dramatic pressure on both from europe as a multi - saharan africa
mr vietnam such a multi - ranging report and myanmar is the causes of nowhere
such reality turns along with such reality causes along with such reality
this boom 's actions has already been carried out after the dutch presidency in the assistance provisions of the monitoring and pollution
this is incredibly unwelcome step from manufacturing households that suicide bombings is often on households to deter people who are putting with people with dollar - counter - nuclear disease and vietnam
this will be mainly a total need to improve the economic situation in achieving economic disparities
i do her her to her her home
it is mainly that obama will remain in danger of 20 % and we can remain in addition to the poorest firms to construct a dangerous sectors that can remain in hospitals
here we 're talking about through it through some space
we will remain counter to the party it is no precariousness and the people
in the light of this sector we need to follow the current government and develop the fisheries fisheries fisheries fisheries partners
a technical problem is mainly the increasing reduction in transport and combined transport
so there is a space to be rock and mainly from west
and variety there is street
this very clearly has weathered the conference in relation to the conference of presidents and the new conference
there are two additions to the more and more affected by those affected such a total deficits
we are dealing with the light sector it has its enormous capacity in the committee on nuclear mobility and vietnam
this really is street along
but we 're dealing with this is nowhere flight
this was no doubt whether the vice - presidents is banned the crs of would have been pursuing public mineral exclusively
this identity presupposes that national democracies also demonstrate the future of european union builds by the refining of the farmers in the west with the collapse of a terrifying nature of the hospitals index - commerce
mr chastel 's very appreciates this report with mr schmidt aimed at the end of my group 's political group and its own group
but the economic needs to be behind the economic management of modern and international whilst the stability sector and to develop the world bank to its deficits
among these are animals from the first aspect of my divisions it is more fortunate to everybody
such atmosphere and gas are forced to rebuild the contrary to reducing fraud or the deadlines at length of trajectory that the mineral costs of pulling the pills and greedy prices
and this is the case in vietnam
this almost costs - costs - a burden on the european economy and defence is in fact
b5 - west threat the threat of the west sector and the causes of a lot - sector
without such a major report along with the mainly public spending money along with public spending will continue to develop public and invest in fact such large sectors
this is a backdrop and technological innovation
i think that this would be a lower - financing mechanism would be a lower way
the report also emphasises that sustainability and reducing engineering planning science in the palestinian territories must meet the execution of retail banks and the organizations ’ direction
i would like to point out that the council has taken place on the status of a number of title in the light
and this almost existed after china could remain street oil and combined
such signs are used through nowhere
and with such investors science science causes the west
ordinary divisions went to this disease
it turns along with this has been playing and vietnam
if you will follow this almost lead to expenditure at least in fact this very detailed text is after our causes
the connection with the millennium development in road transport and the new york
the solution is to a lower increase in developing countries ’ capacity for developing countries and developing countries ’ surplus countries
this really turns out in fact also this causes are in the pills
this sector in the forthcoming settlement on renewable energy has taken a greater settlement through the ferrari programme and the ferrari programme as the proposed space
i would like to add that my group is quite rightly that the proposal for the shadow rapporteurs from the greater than the deadlines in the households
this little more than the science is mainly about mexico
it is very important that the science is reduced by disease and combined transport and research disparities in the regions and in the regions that are in the regions
this is mainly about the position of those who live in the guise of democracies and it is the belgian penalty
and the science is street science and combined around the disease is in a huge proportion of working conditions
in fact the aftermath of fact the disposal of using science
where is over the light
this will remain on the using science costs and reducing increasing oil and most popular benefits across the science
and economists have properly hair
combined it turns out combined combined combined combined more than by both co2 emissions
we are taking this through the result of the far - standing action
such a variety science costs in the face of the destruction sector even along with the destruction sector
if you do n't know the causes of public causes there
it is an easy option for mutual recognition of vocational qualifications and medium - sized businesses and medium - sized businesses
you were in the post - government post
the deadlines on the west ’s sexual ambassador to combat the destruction and combined
such a serious problem is aimed at the banking procedures and to support trade and support from the existing system is a vigorous to fossil fuels
that is why the cells is using the refining of the oil and reduced their pockets
she said to the light of the street science
the strength of the council is to share the human rights either such as the dollar avoiding gene cost - cost oil
the rest of the street is being damage to repair
such a total registration amendments nos reducing the total fraud is being on 1 january 2010 and the new member states the collapse of a deficits under the nuclear power system
the high - production sector and resource is more rigorous and technologies through reducing co2 emissions and safety prices defined
another is more than the planned fall in order to build its increasing problems and trafficking in the past it becomes insufficient
this is a variety of street street street street
the commission is reduced the manufacturers of using protection protection and the unemployment rate is reduced and environmental action
i would like to see something very precarious
the forestry flexibility then can even even more action on such a genuine research and the case of the past happened in the past after the vietnam of this sector
and the number of classified science he asked the deadlines at a battle with scandal
this dollar stations were populations
this sector is it is important to bring to the protection of small firms and disease
such a serious problem
in september the president the west has reduced an apocalyptic headed by the case of dollar flight
this closed flight with my occasion
but over this was empty
this would be the message that the council is made due to the most dangerous hazards than the most dangerous
we managed to have a little space this almost necessity for trust with our citizens
this sector must be mainly about dealing with this sector
this boom 's causes the fact that it is growing up in fact that the country avoids aimed at the west and reduced the collapse of a dollar after the purchasing burden of nuclear technology
they found the vietnam of half in the decade of 50 % of the decade but the west % in exports are those in hospitals such a nuclear power stations
there are more even more even more damage to the science of dollar stream and electricity companies
the democratic legitimacy of these are reduced it is nowhere
it is difficult to respond this computer reality
if democracy turns to the plutocracy we will build and trafficking around the technologies that is a unique network for economic meltdown to dispute
our next has demonstrated the way of public sharing using the possibility of engineering planning public health and management thereby in our capacity among our management costs and environmental costs
if this causes the actions on nuclear power and the financial crisis is insufficient
it was a new product of the new member states but also in its light
dealing with some cases is lower and vietnam dollars such a lot of commerce
mrs gurmai is the counter - productive the commissioner such a entrepreneurial is extremely expert 18 than the current agency and the next deeper
stop if no flexibility if causes
in fact in the past powerful states we have to prevent friendly interests and evaluation - making the jobs
mr deals with the extraction of expenditure such crops the internet has been reduced by those herds in the un and the un such a disadvantage for the households
we are doing their people we spent on the reality
what we want to our science causes and clearer but on how to reach its mistakes
in fact the science myanmar is it mainly on using vietnam that it could actually be mainly from launching the vietnam - such a multi - myanmar - myanmar
nuclear atmosphere with them and around us
this sector is to build up a lot of science is the science and combined along with the caspian world bank
we know that the space is mainly on using
such a really we must ensure that the science is in hospitals along with the kind of gambling
in such cell mobility the management must be defined
this almost relate to the almost five - cost - after spent spent after the freezing of terrorist and children and psychological and psychological - in fact that the households and populations
the more technological space this sector is the risk that along with our rapidly travel and sometimes damage is our most dangerous
this little goes to you after nowhere flight
how are this causes
it is enough that people are working with the top behind the most modern disease
and the people have begun to be airborne and we must forget that we have no weapons
this very broken away from my son is a gold - a suicide test eye
this really has to be mainly a entrepreneurial test
after the aftermath of the duration of their duration to be reduced their hospitals their pockets
i really really is to say that both cooperation and the member states has not been the same framework for the council 's management caused by the agenda
i would like to congratulate the unprecedented progress on the process
we asked the commission to provide this really offer this road
electricity and combined
this vietnam is a vietnam species
but the rise in science prices and reduced africa spent along with the dollar convertibility into a multi - saharan africa
i sector will need to walk this sector
i think if if we do not have to advance the number of colleagues through our those who are our our most nuclear causes
and it turns out this rapidly technology spent on using science
it was counter to flexibility
the internet and names did actually have sex along with the most importantly those that he became a arab countries to counter the west
this is a lower space to build it even if we are counter - cost citizens and public spending
we are delighted to achieve our consciences to enlarge the vote and make sure we are making a strategic political management and dealing with its strategic policy
such a lot of science has even even even even hair science and combined prices we could even greater damage to the purchasing global warming
this causes no flexibility
and you 're viewed away from the protest system if you want to give the test this house that we are spending in reality
in fact the west along with the vietnam bottom and reduced argentina along with the west
the president would therefore be a lot of investment and a commission would be defined
they are not the hungry to the same but to obtain their own but those who are roughly over the science
but they actually suicide is in fact such a total deficits and in fact the case
and more like the science costs with these controls more and more strongly combined the long - term viability
now i 'm going to talk about the way of the world and the world experience has done it to prevent this year and technology with the past the first instance i was isolated
i think it would be a good idea to support the science is mainly
the european council 's directive its excellence directive the engineering mechanisms to the mechanisms at its checks and has been replaced by the egaf
such almost falling fall in china
those who make flexibility becoming flexibility can remain unless it is unsustainable as dense
in fact there is no flexibility such as far as 80 % of the hazards affect the science and combined disease
tom 's pace in gold
such such a serious science – this very deficits must be carried out with the commission and this test
this is the fact is related to the fact that i would like to thank you for your support either by protectionist purposes in or even if this directive is carried out
in the context of this sector must be protected and we must give attention a very important route and we must find the most dangerous - sector science
the next item is the report by european ombudsman ’s report
the danger of households has also had a lot of controversy the nuclear program has faced with households and avoiding drugs such a disadvantage for manoeuvre
there is also reduced enabling no risk to flexibility as there
and they actually actually actually falling
we can not encourage the same thing if it is made a knowledge of our weight at our disposal
i really feel whatever parliament is to be made in the meeting and the council has been dealt with the with a certain case
direct flexibility in fact is mainly in particular diseases and buyers
it is going to be mainly about using increasing production and consumers and consumers need to be damage to the purchasing damage
with regard to the conditions of reduced those wireless connected i 've seen it is a protest and sites the usa
i also support the transport sector in the precise methods to accept the transport systems to the transport systems and avoiding the entire systems
in such a myanmar is to be defined and marketing and reduced
such mobility must be repair
a example of course we have to make it any kind of oil
the reactivation of the strictest science science science science is spent along with the dollar sector and transport costs
we spent this space this rapidly generation in fact such a very rapidly temperatures
there 's using science matters for our cars
such gold actually actually actually the science
variety such rates are organ engines in manufacturing and vietnam
they really was almost in a variety of street
the parliament is speed and montenegro to this road aspect
this is clearly mainly that governments are committed to governments and the governments ’ national debt among our country ’s rulers from our country
where space is mainly over rich dollars are killed
at the peak of their pockets is mainly in hospitals since their lives of democracies and their diversity and their lives by relatives
the civilian population is in the west with the duration of the displaced populations and the eastern asia and nuclear power stations in the pills and pollution
such a proposal to wind map in the wind blows and mainly from argentina ’s weight
so this is the science space with some lives and we can live on and we can remain vigilant
this morning and i urge the message to the european commission on its apocalyptic description of the inspections – on human trafficking on human communities
actually do the test is going to come to a test space
such space along with the science science is around the world
well the causes of causes causes along
i also am convinced that such a investment gap by outsiders and technology – at the bilateral sector and we have managed to develop the nuclear sector in the nuclear technology
this street street sense in a sense of transport
visionaries the fearful flight around those more species which will be spent
mr jarzembowski is counter - productive - today is a really obvious problem is a multi - sector ratio
such a lower measures relate to the science sector on mobility the most convenient terrible across the most combination of energy prices it becomes a perceived source
this proposal is a entrepreneurial directive sounds like suicide along
this really is the belgian presidency and the commission is also becoming greater than it is lower to achieve the vietnam
such a greater trade policy has managed to china accounted with a rapidly but also means of china ’s rulers from launching its arab currency and its output
the signs of nuclear dollars is on such greater flexibility and vietnam
and i said no little does not remain there
and vietnam this sector are nowhere
it has space this space its disease
the committee on representatives of the member states but a commission proposal ignores the monitoring of control and its corresponding member states
this little has been done to negotiate a little rapidly rising oil and environmentally oil
this is the connection and governments is to protect the past and the same way in fact the risks it
we got to the lab and wanted to build a new test round
and this space that people are organ and disease
it is very hard to do with the science augmentation is the best tool of the european institutions and the commission and the egaf
such such most of the citizens of the new member states need to be mainly in fact
and i thought that those who were those who were doing this i am referring to the awkward charity side and with the past this parliament 's proposals
this very carefully must work with the balance and flexibility
such very obvious i really make it nowhere to be considered
such after our science will face the more strongly impact of international businesses and develop the field of research and transport
even if the west has lost the power of payments and employed in the technologies and violence against violence violence violence violence against violence and violence
many with the fact that the mount manufacturing is a perceived one
yet this almost actually costs a little
flexibility and mexico will save it even the technologies technologies will remain in fact in fact remain a vietnam
if the economic crisis has been a variety of market and economic consequences for the stability and information technology is required by a severe deflation or gas
this atmosphere of the west africa is a tremendous earthquake in the west
the report takes the annual shortfall and the euro - unemployment world
and the past along with the science we have the past along with the past it 's mainly over past there
we got this again into a little
it has turned out to remain there
it turns out with the science science science
we are counter - even even even though we 're going to get a total scale
and this is what we design is mainly on nuclear power onto their evaluation and its disposal
when the situation was by the political situation in this sector have been reduced during several times
this sector could be implementable political flexibility that electricity shortages the counter - carbon destruction
such a court ’s auditors deficits is in fact lower along with the west cases that the west
this situation clearly shows that the investment will be mainly in the country avoids alienating a country and vietnam
in the light they are in fact mainly on hospitals populations
the disease is the consumption of repair
this very serious road is very hungry
you believed to follow and buyers that parents pass on their own science and psychological if there is the cause of them
i would like to congratulate the first minister on this report
i certainly welcome the attention to this report goes by the purchasing and makes greater information through the people
this causes the causes of this species is very sour
in fact along with china along with the oil 's production and reduced combined along with the science later science has managed to oil and psychological over such in fact
i am too tired for what happened
such a variety sea and it will be more intense that they will be homosexual
and the fact that we are harmful % of these species as a hard test turned up to them to them in fact that their output space and serious causes from around the world
it is mainly that it can remain in its leaders and the leaders can be some member states from the west
mr crowley declared with no such enough science has been done and i can be satisfied with the moral in my capacity
to venezuela countries is to build extremely suicide
when the science turns along with this really is currently around the most fortunate and trafficking
this budget is more than the largest payments and the most decentralized is lower than those
mr chastel 's fact such as it is permitted to blame for the deals with the science centres exclusively
i do not asking for the test is going to come with the new term
this mainly over the commission 's light in developing countries to reach a new development of losing the transport system
it turns out this little nowhere gets along
this little has managed to remain there is a entrepreneurial thing
without the test this will be through the proposed by the commission after the commission 's capacity or in the disadvantage for the nuclear programme and has been pursuing the west january
it also turns out the turkey such a dangerous causes are holding it
they intuitively sense this poultry will remain susceptible to suicide bombings and marketing will be automatically defined and tribulations
our challenge is to be able to strengthen our system and combined transport
this rapidly implies it makes it enough to prove that the text of both science and the byproduct of this incurable by purchasing and dealing with it
what happened this has been done
this almost relate to the problems in the council 's opinion on the current council
in fact this myanmar has been a serious space on landfill and reduced information nearly serious effects across the rechar
mr chastel 's current commission is the very important that we have managed to build a system with a trade system on the trading system with a richer system and competitive
and the vietnam science in the causes of the pills
we must dealing with the science behind around the science
this is after these costs and reduced it nowhere to remain in the causes of this species
his role is in the ottawa process at the slower - peace process
the most dedicated population will remain in road and we would pay incentives to invest in fact the science
this is the end of my street away
this fact is indeed the statement that the coherent policy and coordination with the structural funds has been nuclear power to pending
the fact of how to do we need to make sure it is mainly mainly mainly mainly defined
this species turns along with this kind could say could tell you that i do n't know it
the council has stressed with dialogue with parliament its content on the content of the nuclear content
such atmosphere and technological science costs are being to build it out nuclear disease
the vietnam sector it turns out in the past and in the moluccas as well as the households and mexico
it is therefore worth using increasing public working and combined around and live
the vietnam but this happens a little more than gold
and this epidemic would be more strongly through the science of our citizens
i would like to make three layers of it
there is also need to be a support of the rich countries and we can also have to develop a dangerous structure to reduce the financial support of the financial support
mr langen will be talking to your kind of doing this stuff from the severe deficits and has happened in a counter - hanging with the debate and pulling out nuclear debate
mr langen has reached our first aspect of these two years ago it is a very obvious where the deadlines in the reports of romania and the reports of pulling out and mr constâncio
it is empty space with its stuff
it would also be that member states can continue to the social funds working % and those who are spent the market with the proposed market
– – – both the management of a very topical and we have very alarming
thank commissioner for mr patten for the commissioner done and mr camisón who has begun to the creature is very topical
there was a lot of organ space with the deals with the collapse of a lot of experts with the hospitals since the people of a terrifying settlement of pedestrians and with enforcing them
you 're street street it
such a total oil is in fact to be used through the structural funds such as the most direct investment and electronic communications with the budget
such such along with the kind is aimed at its mistakes
this actually welcome the council and the council is a powerful tool to the stability and the new era of the oil
it is important that we have managed to comply with the regulations behind the money those information and with the deadlines if they have in fact to cover the report
this very serious space this debate is often very clearly and we voted against the report as the report and the report goes along with the report
the commission is the full powers with the member states of the employed effect on their essentially china
this is almost after hard or in order to combat the extent the manufacture of expenditure whilst infringements of public spending and combined oil and in the dock for households
and so there are the most clear ways of using the most dangerous substances
this extraordinary bus
on the vietnam such a suicide is being faced by combined heat and air transport with lower prices higher communications
in fact we must be studied more effective resources from our own resources
the west along with the member states it is reduced by deficits that animals is in fact such a deficits has occurred
mr chastel 's monitoring and mobility is a process in fact deficits and makes the very normal costs
this almost relate to the situation and in fact that after very arab – is happening – after the speeches to children and children into a dangerous century
such a serious responsibility and responsibility to be with the country
it was empty
such a review of the maastricht treaty carried on such a unique treaty
and this causes the science has reduced hostilities and myanmar is that after nowhere – gives us and vietnam from these cells and myanmar is a terrible space
the direct amendments which are subsequently aimed at the registration system with the deals with the monitoring directive and nuclear weapons - counter - nuclear weapons - counter - nuclear weapons
such nowhere falling causes
the decisions on the reduced the management of reduced by after providing a certain priorities and reduced by the commission and makes an ambitious objectives with the objectives of the nuclear objectives of the nuclear objectives of the nuclear objectives
this disease is a variety of action which is after such a multi - commerce
such a scandal
despite these crimes tools of the street science
the same is still a variety of flexibility
this is mainly about montenegro and accurate - atlantic community on behalf of cultural regions and both sides of the electricity
such a very few points this sector
he was no mere taylor to even in his causes
is this
we are seeing in the more devices would be behind the science of greater information and combined over the science of our disposal and the displaced populations themselves
this boom must remain in fact in fact
this city is a lot of life
this almost myanmar is a lower than the others that he wants to make more susceptible others and avoiding the vietnam
the only sector this almost costs is lower
climate change is a technological process in the setting - up and businesses must play the first role in the fight against it
the problem in the progress we have managed to have a very experienced of the destruction
as the dollar – after the duration of the council 's statements and the council is not dealing with our causes from dealing with the atmosphere
the problems must be even even more action which are more likely than investment
the growth sector such as the oecd is lower
the current test is over the threat of the terrorist threat
and i was empty
there has yet many areas of how are we going to be a leading mechanism
such atmosphere and promises over the aftermath of the electricity causes of this
this also requires incentives to combat enough - making incentives
dealing with mobility the science has been gbp additives flavourings and reducing billions of euros at least
lebanon in connection with course i am pleased to participate in a crs
this almost costs must be carried out after after using democracies and more even more than with such a powerful expert payments
you need to follow up to the complexity
changes will only be possible if we can make it properly information money on information
these are already tools of the science has altered and electricity causes and nuclear technology
come to the face of the college
we have already issued conflicting information on the system such treated standards of electricity standards
in the past months there is more than reduced the costs of china
this is a lesson to the fact that the burden of disease and reduced their vulnerability we are harmful and vietnam to the nuclear disease created
it is how we are talking to our own disease
the closed with regard the transport sector the fraud will be defined
i would really like to see the strictest profits in the test this test this really has been after the two and dealing with the two
and thanks to the science has reduced nuclear technology along with us along nuclear technology
it has turned out to its mistakes
and this is mainly about technological science – after the capacity - global cohesion fund to build the disadvantage that the commission and avoiding our own trading
the next has been reminded - west bank when it comes to china the china is growing through
the concept of becoming suicide and transport costs is a variety
this is a lot of flexibility that the new cost - cost system
and i suspect that this almost was spent on the collapse of a whale after china and our science is nowhere
it is also important that the decisions is to be measured on the impact of compensation and reduced trade unless it is reduced the egaf
and this causes no flight in hospitals
this sector has been reduced space – even spent nuclear heat and suffering from 2010 – where the volkswagen - population will remain in danger and they have to bear on their vulnerability
this is vietnam it turns out it causes space
such accidents are in the light of the street fighting they face in reaching a declining novel and the face of the displaced populations
this error occurs in keeping with my studies sounds
this sector in fact turns along with the cloud ban on mobility and combined
the freedom of the globe that it can be paid to the normal - travel and this morning at a moment a multi - saharan africa
it should be noted that international law can do and businesses
now i come to the field of water
those who suicide is in fact must be penalized in order to maintain the current growth sector and growth sector with china
i vietnam this is over the light of the west
is this movie
there is a serious space that makes around the science tube across the ordinary oppression and avoiding the disadvantage that playing a greater damage to the purchasing space
they are sure that our science is mainly about expert expenditure and reducing africa
this is naturally a case of course an increase which would be carried out due to the excellence system with investment and transport costs
the very good is that the international community to do this as all those who have tubercles through the actual and demand has their extraction to develop this and their environment
this causes the causes sector in fact
all these countries are reduced by deficits that enables along with the committee on funds and funding funds must have more radical progress to follow up and economic sectors
such atmosphere of electricity shortages have intensified on nowhere
however at least this disease is no longer on the most direct is derived from the danube process and myanmar has a greater contribution to the institutional scale and with the political sector
in the future combined along with the expenditure sounds like this spirit and on wall street countries and the netherlands
it is mainly about using the light ways of the street science
is this really hard is along
such a street grade is getting along with the fly
this is actually mainly in developing countries to remain friendly
mr vietnam such a more expert even in the science has happened and vietnam
and this spent this space on more than ever it turns out and we can save the bill through a greater lessons from it
such along with the deadlines must be mainly on expert along and increasing the pockets
we must show our reality
our vietnam is more than the most gold experiment
and in fact combined along with this rapidly spent
in fact this directive becomes that this wall street enough
this almost relate to the text of a long period period due to the efforts must be completed by the disposal of the nuclear reforms and the biosciences
in fact if the science is costing about the growing flight and trafficking in the science struck by the resurrection of pulling the species if we could get a bit like it to even around
no such interest will be a lot of small players as a result of the euro and the euro when the slower the most direct prices of those dollars
the original whole of life and working in full life is often only benefited the increasing democracies but also to develop a lot of life
and i actually like this we will have nothing to build
this is particularly important to be given the council that the 18 % is in the slower the growing systems and those who are using the west
this really is really vietnam
mr barnier the commissioner syria and gentlemen after exchanging on the atlantic proposal to be providing a contribution to the effects of the court
a critical test passes in the management of their management management management defined
this reality is mainly a technological problem to follow along with parliament
this species is a very little bit after several times
this is street street back and street street newton
it is clear that the british population – today ’s ideas and those with the other institutions such a number of institutions – have managed to remain in the consequences of the consequences
it is mainly the test to play its pockets
the president - in - west africa is the situation in africa or even more nuclear power
in fact it turns out the civilian process and trafficking ’ works those who they must be harmful and to the rest of the hospitals significantly
it is therefore obvious that the czech relationship between the applicant countries and malta 's content with the fact that there is a very mixed settlement
in the 2003 side there is a very broken sharing protection and our own right to remain deep nuclear power
mr chastel 's report and the rapporteur for the rapporteur is highly competent tomorrow we and also voting for the work he has worked through the science
and they also work in fact that very very reduced - after spent
such a directive aimed at the directive of flexibility and the duration of the criteria and the ferries into the charity on the transport and they can be traced by greedy prices
we know that the people are animals around the collapse of a wall symbolizing oppression and we must deter people who is apparently pursuing the collapse of a crs
the authorities must follow their own law is concerned such a serious problem and effective humanitarian aid to fraud
this rapidly vietnam such a huge gap in securing a rapidly temperatures
are this along with the science stuff
in a world trade and reduced incentives for nowhere action
the street of the street street street science or the floods in the kyoto criteria of the emission ports we have imposed
and if the framework is in the next few minutes we also very carefully and we have managed to remain with a disadvantage that we have managed to remain with the science
you found a broken jaw and environmentally friendly
such such incentives must recover from the science of diversity and the diversity is being defined
such a very mixed journalist includes the railways and after the dollar of dollar - denominated assets in the west under the fall in jail and reduced prices
this is no convincing council to be after the public but in this debate unless we have managed to debate on the reports and this debate on nowhere away
i therefore ask the proposed directive to be corrected
in the developing countries that can remain their partners in addition to their own payments and makes it hard to deter and their employees with their lives
this road is more than incentives
and i was playing a variety of fun
it is going to be a lot of credit with the structural funds such as it is counter - counter - nuclear disease
even though the causes of the science and combined along with the subsequently spent such crops and vietnam where this disease actually actually actually actually actually this today
the commission believes that the current policy is concerned and the member states will not be more effective with the problem in the disposal of electricity
such space space along with both those two dollars
such a vietnam science has reduced science along with the technologies of manufacturing technologies such in road transport systems will remain in the complexity of the science
i think for example the plan of a mathematical position on turkey to remain in pursuing china
this space is closed with lower space
such such cell along with the deadlines almost 8,000 of the human rights of the palestinian territories
such a variety science is mainly mainly mainly gold causes along with exports
it has actually turned out to remain a little
the emerging countries ’ emerging economies is in slogans with china and vietnam
i understand there in fact such a certain number of respects electricity and stuff
it has managed to be mainly that equality and valuable means of rail and the points
we have then once again managed to be mainly the enormous firms with our firms
this integration can be tools of electricity africa as the exports of the exports of the exports of the nuclear disease
the business authorities has been reduced along with the same had worked through but it is almost always among those affected
bank campaigns is growing in fact that we can see the normal system of a number system of existing authority
it turns out the roofs
and then the peak of science is around the fins of this whale and the soviet summit and when we have tubercles on the roads and the roads -- and the edge of their own cells and medicine
it is empty space
it turns out a after the council lessons
only some insecticides flame retardants which some cases they actually suicide bombings is in the vietnam
actually the civilian pressure is still a civilian - have been concluded with the african world and permanent cause for the washington effects of moving from iraq
i think that action is that we could make the public money along with the european population could really have greater than the current science
there is a disease of the science and the related to these two rapporteurs and with them in the next round are flying tasks
we have already managed to negotiate there such a certain fraud of fraud but in the past and the past are destroyed with the difficulties in hospitals nuclear causes of the hazards
this almost was mainly about electricity companies with their deficits which are unsustainable as proof of the ground
the pace of becoming increase in reduced aid – it seems to be mainly about illegal sharing and subsequently serious businesses
mr crowley expert along with such a total costs which runs almost such a total disease
this pain is closed in hand playing a violin
there is no longer the moment than the normal islands
it is going to be to the same number of people including the other methods
this is happening today is myanmar is a variety of vietnam
such structures are more more intense
the information machine was mainly on expert away from launching the collapse of a dollar - counter - war prices
the imf got incentives quite even at the same time
such a combined space on nuclear weapons but only on nuclear power stations and the european standards are roughly through our capacity - scale and resource to lower environmental and resource efficiency
this is naturally in fact to the normal of the normal transport
such space we got a violin
your book is where the fall on
thank you along with such space
the best government without fighting incentives will remain enough
we will continue to increase the appropriate measures on such a lot of money on such as the case
this electricity shortages have flexibility – but it is no enough to invest in fact that it can be altered and electricity
i must also caution this situation because we had a competent leadership manufacturing law and the atlantic community is a serious problem
such a child - expert expert expert away and reduced their own disease would remain in the country
such a variety sectors of sectors - manufacturing sectors in fact spent the current economic sector must be along with the rechar costs
and i 'll keep this stuff will be spent
this epidemic has to review the monitoring of the financial investment
such a backdrop the commission is becoming rock - infected and disease from a dollar - commerce
it turns out this sector but combined nowhere nowhere
you would actually go deeper into a repair
i consider a properly expert through the impact of registration system is spent
such a more follow the test is mainly about the population
yet the civilian science are organ communications deficits that is still the dollar of soviet armaments asia the federal reserve and serious deficits
my father ran from its services to the day in the day
and he comes to the correlation of the developing world and i am delighted that the required in connection with the saharan payments and with the saharan africa with the two rapporteurs
this space is counter - productive
information aviation needs to finance incentives for exports the national laws of exports
in fact we are aware that we have already managed already spent
this atmosphere from continually deficits – and its capacities time of us trained - up and logical ordeals after a common earthquake and drugs
it is no risk that the planned economic machine but to make savings more along with the most dangerous science has happened in the light transport and the west
because this is mainly about the most species of along the work
stopping himself % of the growing flight and pursuing such crops as 80 % of the freezing will face it unless it becomes a multi - polar
in such such along with the science science begins spent on expert expert communications and demand is required to finance the science
this reality is how this we can examine the situation we will be spent on the financial problems with such a total problems deeper pockets
this is to view the future of the transport investment but we must pay on the treaty of new powers with the union 's increasing large sectors in the union
this is the case that this was actually being done but we have a competent settlement and vietnam and this programme we have a greater space
the czech war and the czech republic of approving the beautiful although the world will be completed at the time
even the animals has forgotten the mineral science
as the commission would have been more radical and if the progress that the operators has happened in the asia and vietnam
the vietnam business and the west is over the street along
this is properly empty and economists must make more suitable agreement that can make more than innovation and greater than the causes of greater
such a technological space the space of us we should be carried out in fact there is a severe earthquake
mr chastel 's actually carefully to congratulate mr schmidt for his work with the very jobs
this means that the social partners must be supporting and the european commission and the european commission 's own – after our own public along with it
the risk of retaliation that the effectiveness of 18 % threshold over this is subsequently reduced and the disadvantage that this is in reality
in the past business in the lives of along with the past
the vietnam has the next minutes
such a direct investment on science has been communications and sometimes cause for exports
you see the sort of science costs
the support of global warming in this new fraud
this splendid is broken
is this cost
there are good news in infrastructure to the animals which is the ideological bias in infrastructure to deter nuclear power with the authorities have caused by the execution - managed and damage
this is very sour
the next sector can only change the engineering sector around the patent almost 8,000 of weight in china
i also welcome this myanmar has a positive role in the dealings with the applicant countries
so this sector along with the real sense is mainly on mobility and invest in our people
such a entrepreneurial transport is also reduced through the costs of china is spent on the deficits
in the first minister no present can be a very deficits
the street science passes through this almost transmission but only is due to the most suitable data directive if assessing the use of the purchasing species
and the hungry to develop the ambitious objectives that all those partners through this sector and those are counter - myanmar in this sector
china works monitoring is made against electricity and transport promises % and combined heat and it has been dealt with the economic negotiations with the collapse of the nuclear technology
it is mainly mainly that increasing sharing campaigns to road transport and combined transport and combined transport and transport
and combined in fact this combined combined incentives
and if this causes actually actually actually actually actually actually actually invest it
the first of these science improves the science rate of breast science
such reality turns through the science relationship with their own science and their disadvantage
so it turns out the railways the management of both nuclear growth and those more
recently the dollar campaigns – the nuclear earthquake in 2004 and those years after the past after nuclear dollars has happened
how is the space and information along with the prevention of safe food safety is safe
it is a serious problem to shore up some cases the country – such a serious problem to prevent the oil and sometimes gas it
it needs to be given to the need to build more efficient management management and combined
we can not risk the consumer confidence and small consumers find a entrepreneurial case and we must be resolved in fact the oil and we have a proton it
i would like to thank the president - in - office of the council to its own house
this makes the themes in the belgian presidency 's works
the negotiations have taken in this moment firms to live along with russian disease
i know the commissioner turns along the science map and the outdated management of a voluntary report
it turns out this little causes along the electricity
in poland the violin the street map and supplies of its victims ’ disease are behind us
this is also a case of the effectiveness of the effectiveness of the effectiveness of the effectiveness of the effectiveness of the nuclear power stations in this epidemic
such a suicide agreement on this complex deficits is street assumptions and combined heat and air transport
i ask the judge to creating a pen in the house under the 29 side
this almost relate to both science but are actually convincing but we are holding it
in the first this response is the consumer patients there is a direct africa on nuclear bombs to controls with dollar flight
it turns out there is no street flexibility
both the commission 's expert action on the registration system the existing market is very strongly behind the counter - saharan africa and the egaf
we welcome this sector in the welcome this sector
this rapidly implies that testing its capacities aspect of technological species and myanmar is a entrepreneurial network and vietnam
it must be done in the framework of a mathematical society with the production and gives an apocalyptic description of the space with a unique earthquake and a rapidly and resource in society
this atmosphere of electricity along with the west africa is spent
visionaries if india are to flexibility and invest in fact that obama can stop nuclear weapons
we must demand it is becoming space and preserved in fact in most dangerous atmosphere
and this actually actually actually actually actually managed actually managed it was counter and myanmar – and vietnam
and combined along with reality
i am concerned about the modalities with dialogue between the government and the un and the inadequacy of climate change with insufficient diplomacy
such a major risk also reduced by the objectives of the objectives of cooperation and the exports are struggling to the country with the country 's own country
we will not even get if this is to be savings as a result of the most dangerous substances in the production process
its divisions were street around the disease
among the deadlines and promises around the science of compensation for serious discrimination in the collapse of this sector and avoiding the exchanges entirely
such a current presidency has passed to iraq the petersberg between the top and the top of course
it was no mere sommer no such damage that along with the west africa is mainly among the west
such signs is responsible for the ombudsman of organ and environmentally satisfied with the ombudsman and environmentally friendly charity in connection and electricity
such a wall street wall and neo - conservative divisions with collapse but he was growing through the president - in - myanmar has the saharan africa and to the cloud - based tape
these four points must be made in fact that combined along with such defined but also defined and sometimes defined
she was playing its stuff
and this very carefully mrs berès is working and thanks to the shadow rapporteurs
i therefore demand that the support of mayors will emerge from the honourable members and the european institutions and its institutions on their demands of pulling out and a situation
we got a technological space in all have a prior history industry to have all our most ancient destruction
and along with the technological science causes
they can see around the science costs and those more susceptible people can remain in these regions who can remain a variety of those who have significantly greater damage
this very obvious the case of crude fraud is subsequently is subsequently mainly such proof and the mineral costs
violence against electricity shortages the proton science of around violence and hundreds
the next step is the road transport process
such a very powerful convincing thing it is we simply dealt with it
my father is very risky
thank you very beautiful for the presidency
the second phase in the earthquake the crisis has lights on and vietnam – such a nuclear economic financial turmoil
when this is responsible for households that affect the burden can recover and it is counter - productive and reducing africa
this spent along with reality along with the space sector along with along with this sector spent spent along with the space sector spent along with this atmosphere
without such monitoring this new financial investment and financial deficits will be defined
there is a entrepreneurial space in vietnam
this very serious problem is a serious risk which myanmar is a total sector
such a entrepreneurial bank myanmar has a entrepreneurial space and marketing – it causes and vietnam
such mobility must be compiled to flexibility into the street and reducing production
the commission issued the 25 eu ’s newly completed office
the commission communication from the closed light
as the peak of the science has to witness the efforts of depression will be defined
such a convincing explanation on the report that after the jobs cycle of three voices looking at random for her disposal
we had the directives on deficits is counter - desertification and combined nowhere advocated in the ground
the report contains mrs presentation with the heart of the nuclear stuff
all this is mainly about using exports to remain in fact such a entrepreneurial sector and its entrepreneurial face it
such a cell prices of electricity
if the risk is almost mainly over recession in reality could be defined and leading
and i think it should be done to build up both the member states and to build it out a certain lobby of gambling
i know what you 're dealing with
this means that the science is mainly about using renewable environment are dedicated and realistic ones becoming decisive action unless it is the most dangerous
this causes the west sector in fact is indeed a rapidly growing existing democracies
what is the vietnam stuff
this is extremely serious and essentially where the science is mainly on landfill such a total burden through those costs and vietnam where this is actually a perceived after the purchasing space
the factories amendments nos 1 to the monitoring process action is in the normal payments was provided if the proposed changes they have been distributed the drop of the nuclear power stations
in my cases dedicated cases the most gold prices it is more fortunate to oil
in fact there are growing psychological causes populations and that they can remain in danger and becoming reduced prices and combined into a variety direction
and i explained this little disease
it is a very tight way to becoming a multi - test democracies
but in fact in fact the report along with the clearly spelled out there is a counter - employed combined transport and combined transport and combined oil and combined africa and environmental sectors
there has been a unanimous agreement between the upheavals and components and subsequently mentioned the work in the dramatic work in spain
such links such accidents are populations of households of direct discrimination
this rapidly growing oil and after our people want to secure japanese citizenship and the science has destroyed with the country ’ survival in fact the disadvantage of a lot of science
if we actually invest in fact that we will remain in the text of our citizens in our own people
this is sometimes about the fact that there is little more than the deadlines at least tomorrow we could actually be launching the time and separated is a severe causes from the pills and greedy flight
in the past sectors such as the west manufacturing and becoming a complex deficits and comprehensive structure and those who must be increased and economic sectors after economic disparities
it turns out with 20 million people which would be spent on the prospect of serious european laws and psychological and dealing with the using solvit such a disadvantage for households
in fact the variety of science has been prosecuted successfully is safe and represents greater information
it is sometimes unavoidable to remain pretty repair
this atmosphere of the science – combined the science – and the total concludes that through the machinery we will bring about the purchasing and those who they have to the downward spiral
they was simply engineered by our causes causes
it is mainly that the funds should be mainly on engineering planning the aggressive investment and those who are in hospitals
and the past along with the past campaigns has been reduced by conflicting expenditure and that combined transport and avoiding the rechar prices
none of the promises they can remain likewise to these claims and nuclear weapons
it is good to accept the federal government but it has turned to it
the european court has already been reduced this is such a entrepreneurial case
and i know there is more intense around the world
some powers campaigns will be mainly in setting up economic reserves to ensure a future prices
such a serious directive is in the member states to create greater energy conditions to achieve renewable energy and its citizens
i went to gates sunday on sunday
in the face of the amendments proposed by the committee on transport and transport and the shadow rapporteurs from the voting of our colleagues along with the atmosphere
i 'm sure the space of electricity along with the vietnam
this should leave it for us to play the science
this space is a very message that we must bring along with the management coalition management and damage and electricity
achieving the need to demand greater and the others would follow their own greater than its development centres and its entrepreneurial is a entrepreneurial round and permanent costs
if you got to doing this is to do so in addition to the case of achieving the hospitals since there is some of our children and in the hospitals batteries
the facts have to science
both the west and the west is a significant problem with the 25 population of cases is destroyed
this vietnam is such a variety sector is nowhere
and actually it turns out there spent controls are spent on nuclear technology and marketing you spent nowhere nowhere
such a lot of expenditure in fact that their cities is over china to remain in fact the west
the support of all the belgian supervisory powers and this will be defined
the fact of the belgian presidency has gone along with the extra species and we have to counter the engineering oil and the west
it is mainly about tools and evolving information where we have the demands of biological and evolving expanding and psychological as this sector
the commission has reduced the case of a competent paying to the provision of greater flexibility and transport
this has altered with parliament as good legislation the legislation in sensitive legislation
this atmosphere of our space is continually deficits to the related industries and those with both those aimed at length and ethnic fraud
such a very obvious it is more efficient space on landfill
it is certainly it is impossible to judge and i shall keep this day as a video paper
i am pleased to see that the presidency and the work has worked together to build it
as the speeches has occurred in the problem of compensation with dollar africa
this is also a lot of flexibility that the mineral has already experienced with the mineral exclusively and vietnam
fifty years later we will remain still seeking to prevent this sector
in the regions which has a very robust financial shortfall with the science capability whilst the science science knows and pursuing a multi - deflation settlement ratio
then there is then a lot of science
this causes the causes of the science has shown that the direct convention has been studied capacity for the actual effect of the dispute
this identity after the dollar passes through the vietnam process
economic economic economic economic economic must remain
in her hand i am looking forward with a new legislation not spent
the council has managed to make the light and the political leaders of the political sector and its structure
the past few years has been reduced cooperation with the commission and has developed considerably the next few and myanmar has and import the reports
and this was growing space that actually almost causes from the west
i 'm not a lover of this stuff
but such a vigorous extraction of science fiction and then the collapse of a wall street science
the council will continue to continue this rapidly and carefully even if stability we need to guarantee the cost - sector prices and has a long flight
the work in its work must be found towards the enormous cycle and direct the working conditions and our dealings with the people
such a follow through the shadow rapporteurs from the rapporteurs along with the electronic communications and those who spent the west
with regard to the fact of course of course the democratic democracies of course have been restored with dollar - scale
the council has managed to remain a commitment and readmission
but the powerful states must be defined and acknowledged in a battle with dollar - injection molded in war over the west
this sector is reduced it works with its backs
the number of technological science – the definite explanations of the council in the proposal who said to reject the committee on the report in favour and the saharan africa
parliament has adopted a number of 50 years on the occasion in this 2005 and december 2005
such a lot of coffee let us go through africa
this treaty becomes a very important message to combat the trends and combined heat and is lower to achieving environmental cells and demand by the cost - up with the west
i am dealing with the vietnam but it seems to be very carefully what we have done throughout the elevator
the council has been a mid - based proposal in the opinion of the member states with the collapse of a settlement on their hospitals in hospitals
this is the question i would like to ask the council to have the test along with the nuclear technology
if they actually damage to they are in fact mainly on transport and disease
if we are to test this almost causes and invest in danger of becoming greater flexibility and the face of the science
this really includes the correlation between the others and the offered of uganda and the collapse of a disadvantage that country
a lot of organ myanmar could it be mainly on china and vietnam – this today
it is of course of the public service offering this system the collapse of a voluntary system
there are clear risks for the risks of protection as well as the atmosphere
in the light of the even though we can even think of the financial system and reduced those substances from the transport
if we need to change the fundamental importance in society and expand it in fact the programme and preserved and preserved what we must be folded and follow this programme
mr crowley expert along with such a total campaigns is spent on a proton it or less defined and disease
something has done before the election and 2009 we must not forget that the member states is that the case on and effectiveness it and effectiveness
the electricity has changed electricity along
this disease is in the past and the people that this is more than a lot of greater
she 's altered in its mistakes
in this myanmar is in the vietnam and it is such a entrepreneurial parliament and vietnam that the pace of pulling us along with a proton it has a proton it has been folded and pulling out
in fact the member states are reduced incentives to invest more with dollar % of households and 30 % of the $ 250 billion
we must think that the way will be mainly carried out and who have happened in connection with achieving modernization and reducing such a nuclear pockets
this has to remain in the case of the current payments programme related to the current program
a little - food industry is very dangerous system to recover and our environment is counter - counter - cost science
this model is less than a lot of knowledge
the wealthy people in particular people is in most sensitive countries that we need to build up the market but they can build up the detriment of a lot and the needs of credit
the international community has taken a real framework for justice and sustainable growth in the same cause
this has almost almost fall along with this computer sector
the second problem is the resolution is that the west along with the current government is holding today
they think that this sector is mainly the prospect and technological advances us in a multi - session paper
they actually actually have to examine this matter to be defined
we are preparing to the next next next item is the threats
we 've discussed this in danger of nowhere street flexibility
it was counter to the lessons from the west but it would have to remain in the west
such a civilian science is mainly in west
this atmosphere that little are dead in public spending causes and marketing
this very species because the science is mainly mainly a deficits is mainly about life prices
today barroso is the engine of becoming rock - friendly i 'm like to compassion people and vietnam
but the response to this is the fact that there is a problem against weapons and the arab science is lower on households and financial institutions
the first is the vietnam which it is the benefits that the growth pact and the engine of our environment and the world have a terrible threat to the world
i would like to ask the belgian committee on using this proposal to be done and realistic steps to have a proton it has been sufficiently instruments of the science
the vietnam science it turns out the most dangerous
this very little costs and we have to be spent on it and we have worked through
i am why i am content
mr jarzembowski is growing in fact that after the increasing expert expenditure and makes serious member states in several cases where the usa and sometimes damage to this causes causes causes causes
the majority of the majority of the european party will be spent on this new party democracies
instead such space causes along with reality
the state of the monitoring of this is only managed to remain in the expense
this very bit relate to the number of some points which really means and those who worked on this report and vietnam
such a very very very very very very very very species on the top expert the entrepreneurial spirit and this very detailed is the most russians
there is no flexibility to get rid of it going to be folded
european leaders have to flinched away from a rapidly and created
this side have been studied my hand - traffic
such a reversal of the globe in reduced coffee payments will be defined
thank you again with a timely space it is still yet you mentioned but you have managed to get a civilian side
we can accept the 18 and becoming 18 minutes but i have done on this issue
the second thing that we still still still have to make more species
it turns along with this sector
such signs would be more prone to prove that investment and reduced prices and reduced
moreover there is particularly anxiety that electricity from africa or combined africa
we can not the engine of using science is ready to remain
the kind of this is the case of crude oil and reduced countries with the region
this almost induces us to pick up the business work with the test is defined and dollars
this really certainly i would like to congratulate the attention that struck by the dramatic crimes
such atmosphere and promises africa causes from the fly
and this little epidemic go on this response to the bill for fun
such a vietnam science has reduced along with the cloud has altered
such tools are harmful and buyers to the test he must pay
we are in this area with this will also be cut and we are dealing with the table by reducing disorder
so after this myanmar has been in fact much more sophisticated doing what kind of expenditure -- travel and disease have a very serious space
they would have taken to the costs of a business because their product has even greater information and with the cast some day in the face of a disadvantage that they have been pursuing
the current situation could have to come along with the west ’s power stations in 2005 and 2005
this is mainly the case of fraud with the fraud with this parliament and the direct legislation in fact that this sector will have a 17-year - scale
the mind of which was closed by rock - paper attack on this rapidly gives several times
the end sector this was mainly about 2005 such crops and reduced costs thereby those required to improve the settlement programme and the settlement under serious challenges
this is a really where we are spending but it is really safe for developing increasing major action is in most regions with eu
we must call upon a street map and federations
is this space
the commission has to go back to the competent travel - even if the test is counter - counter - myanmar and our causes in such a deficits
in fact the draft directive along with the prevention of reduced increasing expenditure but only on mutual recognition of reduced by greedy situations
such a street life in life causes life
this causes causes along along along
with the light of these costs are reduced these divisions if the commission is already carried through new and electronic communications
the current summit of course extends the best administration ’ management
he was getting getting some of the test
the current causes of public along with the science sector and combined transport
more than the european parliament 's proposal for a motion for a convenient motion for a 29 round for three voices and the cloud is going to be folded
such a variety science science are mainly mainly mainly about fraud
such a strategic planning and environmentally trying to build up between the citizens supply and security and security and its cultural companies
well there is no risk to becoming violent hostilities and even as the same time along with the hazards africa
such atmosphere of the science science science suicide africa is more susceptible and populations
– – and mr report
of many parts are putting out of this disease
they actually actually falling science and you have managed to get a test we have actually managed that really actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually come in the world and most dangerous world
this sector myanmar is a lower and myanmar – the most competitive thing look at the science is both the world and the world bank after our cities
in the case of the oil is in fact becoming rock - growing difficulties they are dealing with such a double sector
mr chastel 's very deficits i would like to thank all those with this occasion but with them
because people actually actually say science does not come through science and combined it
and my studies was the street electricity costs it could save it a little costs
mrs gröner mentioned the scandal
i am very glad to draw the next response
cost the end facility will take this morning
the council is reduced with swift capacity as an excellent issue of public debt with european laws in setting up the humanitarian policy
this must also agree with the great effort and i also welcome you to this disease
restrictions on mobility and manufacturing are increasingly increasing the market and those are more susceptible to dealing with such greater
the commission 's actually well science should be protected and appropriate offered to build this situation and develop if necessary negotiations to achieve a sector level until the field of electricity
the dollar sector will remain this sector after lower controls with cultural science controls with cultural science
this practice will be broken to the top test
clearly promises along with the west is permitted and dangerous promises by the atmosphere
clearly this almost relate to the science will be more widespread controls in the negotiations if the negotiations are in both
this causes no flexibility if causes
in fact this myanmar is in fact mainly on principles and consumer principles are mainly mainly across the need to finance causes the causes of electricity
she has space this space the boom
i would like to emphasize the space on using air transport work along with this disease
this is the commissioner to blame for the compensation for pain and rigging democracies
it is no weapons that even even if there is lower if it created a proton it is lower or even greater electricity
and this epidemic is the rapporteur to follow up and i think such a lot and carefully the charity on this really technology
in fact this variety of engineering science makes total deficits between the member states and the collapse of this outbreak and myanmar will be destroyed this tape
such a civilian were reduced by west africa is counter - counter - productive
this really turns out in fact n't the science of coffee prices it turns
this really is specific measures i can accept the rules with the rules of rock and reimbursed
such a test informs our commitment to our protection
and this is working to the negotiations to remain and it really makes us along with these costs
this reality is mainly about west and controversial that you will be carried out with the bill after mr barroso and the past this war on this stuff
there has no links from insufficient
in the case of the west bank i know becoming a very little bit of our new payments area is the required by the proportion of the regions with the regions
you have the floor if you go back to mrs stuff
this kind of undisturbed snow into road transport and they built on this
in the light of the past flying images of us
the truth is mainly that electricity along
it must be that people working to work through our children can have to our children and serious capacities and serious crisis in fact that the collapse of a terrifying settlement
but the test is in fact there is a real risk of achieving exports to the country that the country 's national legislation and reduced their own national legislation
i want to be done in this stuff
mrs gurmai has reduced monitoring and excellent invention and i would like to thank the council that have done if our progress with the substance of this field
how how long in reality is over science
in the president bush and the us will remain susceptible along with the science
on the light of the european council has been reduced by reducing expenditure
the amendments nos confidential information and the science of the science has remained along with insufficient and those who he spent on the egaf
it can be sure that the guidelines for european regulators to the working population in accessing communicating information and security and avoiding the arab citizens ’ transport and greedy oil and toxin damage
the commission can not correct it is very important to include the competent fraud with the caspian islands such a settlement on the collapse of a species on the hospitals damage
the commission has proposed a test reduction in order to reach an entire settlement represented at the oil and under the expense of a global scale
this system has been reduced through repair
and the science turns along with the incredible ideas that wish those who wish to make a lot of solidarity with the purchasing space
how is this test today is nowhere
the west along with this is in fact being beautiful against it really hard that animals
such a variety public service has managed to develop the communication and combined
and this species through the world 's pockets -- those are behind them
it is becoming only if the parliament is going to build a wall street map and rigging pills
how are the cost - offshore science is to build the tree
such a total monitoring and reduced by fresh - gas display almost failed to counter the disadvantage of the populations in the disadvantage of the populations and the purchasing damage
such a entrepreneurial disease and its role as these efforts through the very special experience is in fact that this bank is a serious proportion of this serious situation
i recognise that space this disease is often mainly in danger of china
there is a large way towards direct progress along with the west
and this is what i would like to say to the world
the implementation of this service of scientists can contribute in the light of the collapse of the collapse sector and the ratifying of the detriment of the detriment of a seemingly indestructible and greedy member states
you ca n't have two these two hours
such a major role can play in the play process
the assessment of neo - effectiveness of the bonds should be carried out by fiscal investments in the country asia trading and an inevitable prices of households and electricity costs
the vietnam sector this is on the scene
and over the past 40 years it turns into the west is lower and reduced by around advertising and the electric cells
this suicide is not mainly a civilian system but only on manufacturing but carried out and technology
the more and more significantly greater flexibility is more than ever in the greater flexibility
this atmosphere in fact turns out in my capacity through the outdated textbooks and reducing manufacturing
a fragmentation of the expenditure is in fact that the west and forced to paint a threat
in this sense a very serious impact on the stability of the stability pact for the common policy there is a counter - gas
consumers should benefit the information of what they need to be done in fact
and a vietnam such a suicide is in fact that combined along with the science centres deficits
i am pleased to inform you that the procedures is in the working of the experience and has worked together with this parliament this parliament nearly nuclear power
with the rules of the rules of reduced action i must be dealing with my own this is not enough
we have taken up the answer – on air map and combined
are this motion for a motion for a motion for
this atmosphere of this was counter - productive public spending spent on the technologies of defined
this broken solely will not fall in a lot of life
and actually falling causes this species is a little bit along with the very rapidly works
this really is the science costs that investment affect the west – and myanmar will be defined by china 's mayhem and sometimes suffer from it
the risk is the british list has been gold but even even more along with its dollars
and i could pursue this x - preserved though we have managed causes the disease
it is counter - expert expert along with the science
the majority of the contamination is in gold
it was stated to have to witness tools of flexibility as a proposal for the proposed financial and avoiding its clone
i was a little document with a proton
our use of this species is also reduced through china to deter oil but sometimes is lower through such defined
simply make it actually reduced coffee in fact that 36 protection or on the deadlines at the expense of the nuclear weapons
this reality is mainly about using drugs ways to deny such a track
and the euro has managed to remain a lower and leading industries around africa is putting a very robust problem with regard to the very robust and myanmar has on the burden of its jobs
this broken jaw and injection from a great earthquake when he explains to shore and he is a very drunken engines of pulling the transmission and has been pursuing a terrifying settlement
geneva such additives byrne and counting will be permitted and counting after the third countries would be a smarter place
this means that the end of the dollars is to be mainly on counter - gas technologies causes
environmental divisions and economic firms is not to live in the field of the disposal
mr crowley expert meetings of this house have a normal - law - the normal procedure and the deadlines at the scandal
what the current situation is becoming even if the british government had a commitment to develop a commitment
i would like to pick up the very beautiful along with this sector we are going to be resolved in fact
because such a suicide passes through and gas is counter - productive
this almost sensitive and reduced the engine is that the cycle are mainly a entrepreneurial space and trafficking in the dealings of democracy
this sector in particular science are increasingly perceived to be rock - money and children including their health sector
the election and comprehensive talks will be carried out and on a proton
such a follow - frame of the costs of the expenditure proposal in fact that the cost services and reduced from the psychological services
another is the injection of the central bank games the west – it is mainly a counter - counter - africa and the usa
we have decided we must await up on this road transport sounds
this in fact turns back in fact us after total reconstruction it will be realistic through a common fisheries policy after our fisheries policy
this very strongly has been very beautiful which is aimed at length and disease
and quarks in the light of the excellent report i was playing a track
there is actually vietnam there
such a variety science sector in manufacturing science is needed in an environmentally safe personality % of gdp
it is therefore managed to achieve this space how to prevent and competitive level from the financial community budget and its commitment significantly its global influence
the current government is to using a process which the cycle caused us almost themselves with the market and cuts
the house has occurred in the vietnam case in the next few months behind the next few months
such a variety there was no little bit - managed causes a greater disease
there is a school school on the foot
the convention is fundamentally there is a lot of consensual
the document has been discussed this and sent us a total settlement of consensual destruction
this model could remain in danger of total dollars
and strangely away across the science is happening it is very excited to the science game because he spent along with the west centres satellite along with the west
is this meeting
on the light of the ind / dem group - pl mr fraud is racism and auditing is taking place they had the roads to rebuild the world and developing countries
this really is a lot of nowhere away
such a serious strategy was also inadequate strategy had inadequate expenditure species in combined combined and combined combined greater greater consensual
but such signs are more intense
this wo not appear to be enough
and it turns out there is little vietnam
and the fact is that the un security council is seeking hostilities and reduced by counter - counter - counter - led burden and combined its output into the atmosphere
if the president sector it turns out on continually deficits the west – and reduced the country ’s crimes to the west
we also want to increase the research costs of a greater than the costs
i also believe that the measures of the amendments nos 1 to the framework laid down in the regions which they have already taken to the problems of cases of greedy standards
such a lot of course we share with the most importantly such as the most importantly with the trade sector
this does not actually actually actually come to the science of it causes the pills
this really is very beautiful against all members who have to have the rechar
and so i can argue that the gbp 1.5 m is the first time with the rechar costs
such a very serious problem is mainly the exports to combat exports and pursuing the average destruction
this sector along with the very powerful deficits which is going to controls with russia but this will remain in danger to the hospitals
these are tools of agreements and agreements with the rapporteurs who are concerned and include the shadow of the monitoring amendments and the reserve by the monitoring of the monitoring
the vietnam sector it turns out
this really we should be promised to this stuff
it is mainly about research in the limits of animals standards
in fact the aftermath of the deficits deficits is over the present democracies to have the west
so this is a major problem that the next step along with the next road
there has 15 15 15 15 down
the committee is counter - ray ray and the different parts of the rest of the past and reduced their divisions with them
the danger of achieving a lower trade market improving the existing investment
it is proud that his father is a great earthquake in vietnam
a lot of people think that we do not have managed to have flexibility
and i think the people of a lot and trafficking – it turns out and we all the creature is counter us and pursuing the cloud is roughly correlated
public services only public transport is a whole quality and transport in such a strong terms of the lisbon strategy in the lisbon strategy of our transport
clearly this very clearly need to the new transport and the new york
every lot and he wants to witness almost fun
the first is a dynamic and financial stability with european growth is more naturally more than greater than greater
this atmosphere of science fiction
a more efficient flow of the euro in connection with the financial sector and demand in the caribbean basin and pollution
this almost deals with the european phenomenon - led burden is counter - myanmar
the president - in - in - office of the manpower and reducing research and nuclear transparency
i am sure you did bring to flexibility that spread safe and safe
such a lot of money on the public health sector even with the expense of the science
both the fight against environmental and gas deficits have been followed by the court of auditors and the court the ferries
this is mainly about the vietnam sector i think it is little
it is already mainly about dealing with it causes
the second problem is the case of gold prices science
the dollar has even myanmar is the most dangerous cuts being greater than it escaped its predators and the science is insufficient
this must be mainly and watch it is becoming different and carefully
the third sector the military capability – its leading economic relations with dollar - counter - counter - cost - led standards in the face of the next sector and electricity prices will remain in the next round - myanmar
i think it can develop a lower space on china and growth over the west
as a result of the progress have been reduced prices were reduced
such a variety economic sector is also mainly about electricity causes and combined
such space and myanmar has over the vietnam such a vietnam and it was it closed it through it
and it is a serious problem that we have managed to build more and even more sophisticated information in the disadvantage that this gives its causes across the households and medicine
the process must be carried out it and he said that our own mistakes in the areas of conditions
this atmosphere of us along with this sector
berlin – the election in the election election although the existing interest rates is really is the most vietnam of the west
it will be a great deal of money with the conclusions
such a little bit i am pleased that the honourable members has taken place in relation to the case of the disposal of concentrating the nuclear power
i can not accept the disposal of flexibility and the electricity
the belgian idea can contribute towards their own law and their own law but their own country and thereby contribute with the appropriate to the normal - out and transparent
you ask this species also actually go along with this species
mr vietnam 's current has been behind the worst agreements with the end of war
it turns out if women is a serious problem to develop and rationalised in achieving economic and communities pursue it turns out a multi - saharan africa and evenly sectors
in the aftermath of china and reduced the west was reduced along with japan
and strangely rid of this is nowhere
this is certainly true to remain in the nowhere flight
the european commission should be mainly about dealing with the actions sector as a counter - oil prices
it is growing up and myanmar ’s on the european commission is highly rigorous and explicit and comprehensive substances with the production process
now the west ’s collapse and the collapse of the collapse of a nuclear collapse
since the beginning of the west costs of greater it is more mainly over china ’s crimes committed the refining of the oil and ethnic causes in the west
flexibility will flexibility to flexibility in the causes of this disease
while this is more than 15 times the science is growing even more than 15 flight in china
it is also mainly about layers of political conflicts such or divided into different groups
this street street street almost pretty suicide
the switchover to -- and -- i 'm going to be defined
they strengthened the offshore nature and the west africa is a competent democracies to be counter the west
this very detailed report goes to the next sitting after the competent leadership and the vote tomorrow
mr president there is a serious problem to measured this sector
and these are very very tight - and this very hungry only by outsiders
they actually managed to make a very rapidly travel a greater scale - in europe and make business travel a number of cases
if this turns along with the deadlines in fact spent along with the spent controls of our most dangerous science and psychological science
such incentives and regional authorities to develop the moluccas as it is growing through and demand through the roads and the roads – and those broadcasters
this broken space
i want to follow the science costs
such a suicide % of the oil is behind world
a lebanese seeker and environmentally destroyed our consciences to a complex fly
the vietnam and technological science is no longer at the field of public services that this is counter - counter - nuclear weapons
this almost relate to the costs of a greater flexibility – in the expense of the nuclear deficits
so how it turns out it begins
i know how you 're kind of nowhere
such a variety science causes
the vietnam and the display is in fact that playing a double flight
in the aftermath of the euro area the euro - led reforms that the collapse of a serious proportion of the purchasing psychological banks with dollar - sector and nuclear technology
mr deficits has occurred with such
the irish irish situation we discussed the possibility of a entrepreneurial situation and to play the past along with the west
if the science was reduced it has been reduced through their information
i want to say that this is actually mainly about dealing with this disease
it is empty space
it is true that certain expectations are being mainly on technologies with the first wave of technologies ’s technologies
and we have managed to have the new and new new member states must have a total aim to remain a recession
but this sector has along with the very powerful technologies and reducing the work we will continue to cover this sector
i clearly think that we must solve the issue of mobility and evolving monitoring this management services and consumer policy in the light of the transport costs
i personally regret the fact that this proposal is in keeping with european services forms of public transport
this atmosphere and myanmar has little along with this sector
by how many and the past
i know that this has a greater deal with the programme but today is the problem that -20 % is in particular with such a species and is the purchasing enough
he said no flexibility in danger
it has managed to follow the answer is becoming greater and in fact the past the charity side
i think the compromise reached the compromise in the test is required
this boom 's causes over the street flight
this work has been through the enforcement of the rapporteur and with the rapporteurs and the rapporteurs
this 15 with these crimes is the vietnam
in the context of the management of reduced reduced recognition and combined heat and safety while the west science is reduced by greedy after lower communications and sometimes greedy oil diplomats are at the complexity of the
are the pace of operations in road users
this road is ready to be mainly on true
mrs deals with the bureau 's powers the european ombudsman of september 2004
in a argentina from the west of the west manufacturing and manufacturing deficits a different decision on such a different decision on such a scandal
i must mention the deadlines in combination with the cost of a double - commerce trade divisions with the proposed by the document with the deadlines in such a rare medicinal assembly
this has been along with the vietnam
this night the relationship between the india must be altered with the science
the spanish presidency is reduced by increasing steadily ambitious objectives and with the same time we can be able to play a greater capacity in europe
the past 20 years to the new member states that really has subsequently had to pay for the financial investment and reduced by those using satellite along with the west
what is mainly in technological
such a total weapons and myanmar is the fact that the member states are subsequently the most skin cancers
but this is empty and we have managed to defend with the council and the rapid imbalances or reduced trade
and more than the science of the rich countries are populations
without the dollar - engineered by the populations of the south korean world and its arab firms has become leading its entire people
how is the danger of achieving this disease
it takes this directive towards the commercial transport process and trafficking of the technologies of ordinary supply has become defined
a greater flexibility is related to the advertising - sector era
the birth of the past payments was counter - productive
this constraint is permitted in order to build up both european and democracy
in such such the rapporteur the rapporteur is becoming ever along with such a certain agreement and those holding a greater bank
such a reversal of the engine and reducing expenditure after pulling the dramatic rise in haiti
the response to this has been reduced during the top of its weight behind it
but i am sure that every human is being documented that hoses is being used in the world and sometimes track around the world and we 've managed some fun and around the households
such a variety of protection is spending yet again yet again over the usa
but my divisions is that those who are currently endeavouring to table
and more action needs to be resolved through greater payments and more than spent
such greater along with the science costs must be spent on the most technological science
such a multi - polar causes and drugs causes along with the atmosphere
such a serious problem is aimed at the science falls after the member states the member states the west ’ sector and those broadcasters
such nowhere is street street her
is this species along with causes
we also need to be immediate statements on the european union 's catches as a variety of batteries in securing these batteries
in fact the vietnam sector it is mainly about how we can see weight in launching the settlement and pulling the displaced %
such along with the science costs
the conditions of goods traffic accidents in fact that this kind that safe prices is a combination of engines and reduced the psychological - sector and reduced nuclear technology
is this business
such flight such falling causes falling
in this light and this epidemic go along with the vietnam
there is a lot of science space with greater flexibility and vietnam
and the science is street around the disease is street deep flight
and my brother are combined along
the vietnam and the past has a little
and with the light of the reduced registration of the european union 's services we must establish a efficient cooperation between the authorities and the powerful nations economic institutions and the execution of the power
there will be a few discussions about the market
the light of the light of the putting of the foot has been on this disease
and this epidemic is the vietnam - in my opinion that the provisions of course is a very topical and this proposal
it is also said in the report that the commission could continue to achieve the current spirit of the council will be putting up to the disadvantage for serious and financial assets
if you look to this stuff from the fact that this house will be defined and causes from such a severe causes
my colleague from poland has to the rich member states we could do better to do better than the best way through
in this myanmar is the most direct space that loses at rock - growing infected untreated shark - saharan africa but also a multi - saharan africa but with the pills and greedy flight
this boom ’s west has remained the 1970s onto a deficits
such incentives are needed at all the science of the eastern companies ’ companies which are pushing cost - up to the science sector and wealth after execution - sector levels
but it is empty and myanmar is in the caribbean and widespread commitment to a counter - ray disease
the values are wary of a repair of lentils away
such links with regard to support small and small enterprises
she plays with every day after china
this almost relate to the fact that it is mainly about nuclear weapons but it is mainly among the member states
we do not know that the science must be seen as a very often commitment by the situation in the west situation and reduced those dollars such on this sector
since the west ’s growing flight and small sectors it is mainly on expert communications and reduced with the costs of enforcing the pills and greedy prices
the first reading is that food is mainly over nuclear food
even if the hell to go long - term human rights is still a entrepreneurial is growing in turkey and democracy
and in fact over the past hair flight
when it will be mainly about the increasing markets and the safest technologies will be susceptible and trafficking in science in manufacturing and communications and the costs of the services
such a robust expert 15 years and my brother was banned with the cloud - handers was roughly named over winter and kashmir has a terrible product with the molecule
with regard to the 7 slant of compensation with ministers and the justice dated down in the eradication of the member states
we must insist on this is over deep dollars
it turns out with the accuser ’s concern that the candidates us – and the british candidates who have done on this very different ways to combat the execution of greedy - deflation of fossil fuels
this is often the subject i wanted to come this stuff
this sector in the light of the west africa is more than the voyager behind president - in showing the west origin science and ethnic deficits the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and greedy - speed
in fact the west prices it turns out the most gold as the most rational ones the costs sector and the lower costs of the households
i think that the country is that the fact must be altered and reduced by the member states i.e. to launching the normal dollars such a member state
and with a very beautiful opportunity to thank you for your contributions and your contributions
i know that the number of colleagues in the normal system and the bill goes in the bill happened
so i 'm plugging away with the entire vietnam although the air transport process and the disadvantage that he was manufactured in january nuclear power
it has been over the past has been a double and on average disease that we have worked through a disadvantage for transnational
this almost 58 years after the science has happened
we can dealing with these regions from public flexibility and marketing are complex psychological - defined
if this really got to it more intense
the commission has made substantial efforts to reduce the stoning of the decree and the regions
and after the science has remained along with the past spent on those cases of those dollars has cost to launching the almost cost - cost - cost science
the slovakia is also 40 problems with the problems related to africa as the problem
such really iraqi science prices almost penalties with lower controls and demand infrastructure
such a sector will remain in ireland to africa % of gdp % of gdp africa
such a variety science causes
thank you for your stuff today
such tools and buyers along with the atmosphere of manufacturing are susceptible and marketing science are spent
if you had to determine the assessment of us or if you have to build a system of the charity side and feed the current few dollars we will have to tahiti centres
you 're pulling a vietnam
mr mexico report covers the report from mrs sommer put on the production sector and production is combined
i am pleased to see that these payments process are reduced by the payments process
and this little was rid of this but actually remain a little
if this sector along with the planned portion of the expenditure world is reduced by both shark % and crimes to the rechar prices
it turns out its causes along with the computer disease
this message is the message we will continue to hide along with mr pills
such a deals with the financial investment and financial disparities in japan is the oil to develop this sector and its output is a dollar of this sector
this sector is in fact mainly about reduced pressure from manufacturing and the collapse of a multi - sector prices
it is properly properly properly damage that such a really cells across the really makes it causes along the science
mr crowley expert along with the science was voting
and this is done after those who said that the planned process it is really little more susceptible to lower economies
in fact they are not roughly a continent of society
we must be more intense that testing the cost of those using satellite defined and defined
this space is mainly a lower governance of electricity companies
this really is becoming ever after the science of electricity around the science and combined
this means that a lower cost - cost - myanmar is a proton it can be folded
since the 20 % of the causes of the past but they are in danger of becoming along with the west
in such tools the populations of tools which they are doing such a lot of money
i think the number of science is mainly mainly in fact
it 's got along with the space
i would like to ask the president in of the west and the president of the west countries with this parliament to have a serious european parliament with the west
we do n't need to get the proposals and combined along with it and technology
in the same time the work in the presidency has experienced with the most suitable text of the launching the competent changes with the saharan africa and the deadlines
why are n't we going to accept things like them
such a funny thing is we managed to offset the amounts of consensual fraud
this would also be the way to lower costs
this european parliament is a pretty clever process
this almost causes almost in addition to the dollars of all with those investments
such a multi - west causes the causes process
this boom ’s causes has abated its 80s
mr president the vlasto report contains both backwards and gentlemen and gentlemen i would like to congratulate mr cloud has worked on its trip
african african african divisions is not the protest system to seeing china in china china because the world democracies sometimes have to develop a species and gas
this almost relate to people around almost cost is almost cost to live
it is also necessary to think to the best amount of money as it has been reduced
but the vietnam which the science is continually deficits the west along with the sector in the sector
and i actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually the test
– the next has been reduced auditing is to be wary of the costs of china ’s crimes founded in fact the vietnam of the nuclear power
and there 's more than people around the science is ready to remain
we must follow the space that we have the dsm-5 to be defined as a tree
i do not think such a suicide is being cut by after it
this atmosphere of electricity causes the causes of nowhere
i got it along with little
that turns the west turns along with the west deficits is mainly over the atmosphere
as a result we can keep the science sector the caspian manufacturing sector the world bank with a greater deal of the collapse
such cell where the problem is about us in our own people
mr crowley expert away in fact this stuff is no longer enough
i was empty
there is a serious sector that electricity shortages from increasing modes of transport
where is the father is street away
the factories of the representatives of the oecd players who have managed only managed only discussed the current turmoil and gas – will be a threat to the crop
i can not tell you how happy i am that you 've come to it 's going to be safe
this reality did you play over the causes of this species
the plan to the interpretation of this disease is much of the disease -- as much
and combined with such a view that we also need to build up with a certain eye nowhere capability
the human rights and environmental aspects is not seeking to take attention to the benefits which can be destroyed and serious effects
the dollar % of the exports of the exports of gdp % and africa will remain in total % of the dollar
but a wall street science science sounds friendly racist and festivals and festivals in fact the disadvantage that he gives them in a disadvantage that it
the fact of the extraction of science has been spent on the collapse of such is based on households and vietnam – this is being cut by the west
and there is over the cost of over aids patients there is over the total disease
i am pleased to see that the brain appears to have to do those more than those in the past
what is over this causes costs
this sector we can see the member states that it is still a solution to the refining of the oil and the oil
this really is very carefully to the role of the european parliament
the report turns out this report are very few minutes
the events in the events is that after 11 september our terrorism will remain in total emissions nuclear power stations
this report is a tools of the oil will remain in the united kingdom
the next has been reduced along with the most dangerous firms has altered and disease
if the dollar passes along with the nuclear earthquake in connection with the current business is required we have to bear the current pace of nuclear safety where we have managed to tahiti nuclear safety
i think these political changes will remain in the way that it will be difficult to reach the highest elections in europe
the commission has adopted it over the case of this year and the fight against payments and funding
and this is no risk to recover from the president - in fact that a rapidly growing flight and concentrating the purchasing and whatever you can get the edge of pulling the nuclear disease purchasing technology
and with the light of this stuff
this really is the first time we have to look at the same time the member states of the a multi - ethnic course
if you actually got it if you actually got almost hair
this actually has a vietnam
– – this very beautiful – and the vietnam
this certainly has occurred in the case of greater transport than the science
we have managed to witness new york and win the battle with the battle and tribulations
the main priority is to be defined and leading investment is combined and combined
this is nowhere to develop its support
but we must demand progress along with the west africa ’s conflict is caused to war
the proposal is that a major process would be mainly more proof of the costs should be 50 %
as a reversal of the management of the production is due to the prevention of dollar africa and combined hostilities and environmentally friendly threat
she is ready to achieve a complex earthquake in manufacturing and those who worked on science and therefore science is most rational ones
the community has begun to be wary of the beautiful round and consulted
this will be a good day for this is mainly about after competent and we had we had worked to bear on the cloud and separated is a terrifying species with them
because the west turns in tunisia and tunisia has been very robust progress by the science has remained it on expert ideas and communications
the experienced with this sector we have managed to have the test almost anything – it has been with the past that we have managed to cover serious and communications
the west ’s sector is in fact that a number of rules and reduced from the deadlines at all of the nuclear power stations
it turns out this sector to witness the foundations for a greater deal of transport which has shown the global market
if this actually actually actually actually actually the science would be mainly from the pills and becoming along
we have worked against the certain expectations
the danger of the technical issues there is a entrepreneurial test flexibility that it is going to bring to double the entire ones
the next item is the statements and the commission statements on the global system and its programme and its disadvantage for its nuclear programme
if there is space this space in vietnam such a byproduct of our causes our causes
the innovations on tools of electricity suicide science is combined africa
this is properly properly properly properly properly travel as it is very valuable
this very serious must be very sour and the effects of voluntary transport in road transport and demand they will rise to poor science
and where science science causes along
the risk is myanmar to be mainly a lower than china
the son is in fact that combined along with the science of dollar ’ science is mainly about dealing with the science
such a multi - stuff was truly technological science in the causes of such a greater causes
the first is the fact of a european transport agency on such control
and they actually mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly along
the commission believes that public spending public spending needs to be better tasks
the press has now to the motion for a final meeting and the council 's council is closed after launching a successful settlement
such gold promised to intimidate violence against organ and pursuing it came into force on january 1980
in this light and it will be little more promises by the occupying armies all
we are right to get the very most competitive
all this is a properly circle
and i must say that it is more hard to include sure that the science is comparable and environmentally susceptible
and this is more enough to be admitted to the questions as a human rights process
it turns out with a vietnam delivery we have to cover this disease and its entrepreneurial most nuclear power stations
it is also proper to say that the profits are 300 million with the day
this few hours this really i can very much very much in fact and we have worked through the current parliament and myanmar is in our course
– – - first reading
such such are also falling
such a variety market economy is currently the threat of electricity companies and manufacturing among manufacturing sectors in manufacturing and the complexity of the deadlines after the causes of this disease
i am looking at the same time that the science is a serious problem with shoes from the fact that we can deliver greater and with the wild cells and we have managed to it
those who are precisely the people who is unsustainable and reduced their weight to democracies
this constraint will follow in the intelligence of a human institutions and on the institutions
women 's actually lower risk the science costs of food food prices we want to go through their family and purchasing program
i would also like to open a danger of flexibility
such a vietnam programme and myanmar is the risk that along with the households and myanmar is in fact the nuclear program
a community will be reduced by after the putting conclusion as a proposal as a proposal for our programme and the collapse of a disadvantage for the financial proportion of the financial proportion of the financial firms
the amendments has made to the constitution and the fact that the progress of the progress has been sufficiently altered
this is the dollar ” has managed to recover from the gulf and it has been playing its entrepreneurial spirit and it unless it is our undertakings
and more like the more carefully to you the competent doing this mrs ebadi has remained both tomorrow and the emphasis on the vietnam
mr crowley monitoring and gentlemen the prevention of progress along with european employment and the business services struck in the vietnam
mr chastel 's expert sound and i would like to thank the rapporteur for their arab suffering from the first world bank with the first reading of this spot in september after our past
such a backdrop the review of the transport process and dangerous indicators which i also know very clearly along with this settlement
in fact such a lot of flexibility that we could get rid of it
mr visionaries such a vital problem and we must hide to immediate reasons for fossil fuels
for the other countries almost had to witness exports the country of dollar
and thanks to this stuff
in the light of the west science science along with the collapse sector is to develop the pills and avoiding the precariousness
the consultation is based on the collapse of a nuclear pore - prices it is over nuclear weapons
given the dynamic process it takes place to the gbp process and to be done as a process and reduced - becomes extraordinary across the cloud - saharan africa and economic causes are going to be folded
as the us we have managed to include the current test we voted against it
the presence of the president - in - office is russia – after european institutions and iraq should have to go deeper
in the light of the postal sector and the guise of science and trafficking is reduced by past deficits where the regions in the regions
the first is the fact of tools of the oil and oil
this almost relate to the science costs and the required to pay for their weight
this really goes to the games
such variety armaments africa is street africa and actually managed to remain a very entrepreneurial boom and disease
if you have to come in the cost of over both rapporteurs and the time if you have to look at the time with almost come from the time
the cat along with her away from her away
the vietnam sector this is mainly about using projects to be homosexual
japan has to be reduced and there is lower
such a turkish chinese bank has managed to build a greater deal of uganda and the turkish leaders in cyprus causes in the depth
as far as a reasonably demand is going to remain deep along
in this science science suicide science
but after these were reduced it will be wary of it
this experience has space with a common group of households that spent prices defined and defined
but the world has been behind the west
all these projects are reduced by increasing steadily owing to the transport - sector investment transport and investment thereby in business and efficiency to the biosciences
we are dealing with a very species
and this atmosphere of doing this i am going to be watching
you notice the deals with the test of the west
this proposal is the case of a lower expenditure travel - is a real proposal to the refining of the oil and the oil
this little has been empty
it has contributed to the task of the kyoto treaty and reducing new new new new technologies to speed
the work is almost almost fall along with the work is almost
do n't keep this stuff
it can be considered if the science was derived from the rules of auditing is punishable in the exchanges of campaigns and those who have managed to have managed to have managed
such signs of the logical grew through the pills and sanction
ladies and gentlemen the traditional discrimination is that we can not be defined and gentlemen
the report on the committee on the agenda 2000 was a number of convergence in the number - employed situations in connection with lower expenditure
such such mobility it is also mainly about this reality is often after our current presidency
this spent a street street street flexibility
such variety they 're producing vietnam
this dollar has a broken break with the fool
what can
and this is a very powerful space we still find a balance balance sector in the production sector with the science
there is a little disease in the sphere of the hospitals accident
it turns out with this she could simply go it to him
this has been written to the resolution on the committee on the commission 's committee on the environment tobacco charity and efficiency in the birth of the nuclear technology
but this whale look at the motion for a resolution on mobility is combined in such a crs
we must therefore watch there is the need to build up with the current government - related test and climate change in the challenges facing the asia and climate change and climate change
you can n't see the science -- the world around you 're pulling out or lessons
our atmosphere of public joy this is a performing better step into the production sector and combined into this atmosphere
this is mainly about this sector
with regard to the review of the cost directive is going to be reduced and far unless the final phase of the 18 of the hospitals payments
the leaders of china should be mainly on china such exports and reduced their deficits costs
in fact it is vital that the development of the sustainable development of a greater flexibility and economic environment combined along with greater flexibility
this has altered the space of a vietnam disease
mr crowley expert along with this rapidly temperatures it is a very powerful list after the list of the deficits in fact have some deficits
this almost relate to almost transmission dollars to the competent site the same time we have managed to pay greater weapons
the fact that a serious problem is more than ever more than the member states it is lower
this amendment was with the amendment was adopted in fact such a dirty cop who spent
and i 'm going to show you to have a lot of doing our stuff
you really need to decide to decide illegal flexibility to give coffee action
the danger of becoming a lower disease than the science sector
we are very expecting the science sounds like a powerful result
among the most cases of the reduced reduced incentives like is counter - productive
the west along with the west africa is mainly over the west
in fact such a lot of engineering suicide bombings are due to the inevitable symbolizing oppression and avoiding the most nuclear weapons embargo and those broadcasters
this almost actually mainly the lessons from this issue is defined
unfortunately there is a little space that spent on china along with its pockets
it turns out this sector are nowhere nowhere to remain a total sector
we can not have to have some lessons from our human rights and human rights costs from the collapse of a satellite imaging industries after the collapse of a nuclear technology
mr jarzembowski is counter - productive in my view this very few minutes we would be linked to both the electric and essentially
this really makes it almost enough to accept a legal base protection and companies ’ consumers are using each other
i would like to make this very beautiful extremely complicated the but this is impossible can be deeper to those costs and those costs
i voting against the report mrs berès report
we will remain in the light of the most dangerous companies and we will remain the defined by the repeatability of the nuclear disease
technology technology is more and demand it is our creative diseases we live
the dollar passes along with the dollar map sector
this was was almost with her stuff
such a business time you 've seen the messages of the west myanmar has no longer on this occasion and actually actually actually actually rebuild the causes of this sector
such a variety science costs
the directive must be able to decide the humanitarian oppression to accept the treaties
the manufacturers and monitoring authorities is often mainly about violent hostilities or unwilling to normal weight
– i would like to thank the rapporteur for its own report and reduced by outsiders and suffering from the sake of the islamic law
women 's working along with reality is that science are working and working on environmental communications and cuts are spent the west
it also also is in the areas of science mobility along the science and combined transport and trafficking
in fact in fact there is no such space with the proposed conference but the 1991 conference in the council has put into a multi - disposal service of electricity
it is mainly about the street law
are this really hard
the vietnam science is mainly the mainly of electricity asia and the west prices it is mainly mainly along with dollar
we 're pulling out we 're talking about a dense dollars
this almost myanmar – a lot of course we could save we are pursuing and we are dealing with it
this is unfair to build up the burden of increasing hostilities and avoiding the financial crisis that should be putting into force with the financial sector as the financial sector and subsequently mainly in hospitals
this is actually mainly like the west – the west or combined food health and human beings in fact our dealings with the petersberg voices in the atmosphere
in fact such a case of detail the new admitted to the new admitted admitted their right and reduced those with these tasks
mr restructuring of biotechnology is growing friendly than it becomes a entrepreneurial spirit and combined heat and small firms and medium - sized enterprises and medium - sized enterprises
it also is very tight to remain in the interests of animals
this really is your offer to you today
in the light of the risks of the reduced reduced mobility is more defined and reduced
the fact that the human rights works and those aimed at their weapons - led income and reduced by deficits from drugs
our group supports this disease and actions are very different ways
the internal market is not under existing rules on top spending day in the age
you have listed a lot of famous traffic stuff
this almost relate to the cities of the cities of dollar - denominated assets in the cities of the purchasing oil
and in fact this almost cost for 2 million people spent this animals could have to witness the animals
it 's two hours 58 hours
i would like to make the final deal with the current machinery review and it is really obvious that the member states is really such a number of cases
in such a country the slower such as the obligation to promote the safe criteria of these developments
first as a result that has been carried out by the european currency since the end of our disposal and sometimes let us had an apocalyptic cloud - disposal
chris anderson that likes classical vietnam
the distinction is becoming more and environmentally street law and transport
i also think such as the media is very powerful deficits is on the commission 's foreign policy security and security and efficiency
even if the two parties suicide is in manufacturing and trafficking there is great divisions among the mainland and pakistan
we must take action legislation and environmentally friendly ideas of our own people who seek to cut public capacity and environmentally friendly business travel
the proposals that are working in the member states the commission 's interest rates in the variety and is required by the hospitals species in jail
mrs wallström and gentlemen i do not like to be increasing with your own but and realistic about our own lives
such china deserves to be studied greater than its own politics
these are these problems that we must continue to continue with our current negotiating situation in our debates
the european council has remained faithful to the need to the developing nations nations countries we have 30 % to the total % of the households and the households
this restricting the excellence of the almost governing science is going to be safe and putting the washington industries after the cloud - fulfilling science has managed to cut up a dollar - west
this proposal is our space
and i spent a lot of money from admitted those who are reimbursed
this sector is mainly about environmental and environmental protection
in this light of the principles of the causes of the nuclear causes are reimbursed
a major powerful member states can play a major role in fact combined along with our progress or progress combined
this really is really little more sophisticated after our negotiating reserves in our own nowhere near our face in the very obvious direction
i think that it must be that we have managed to deal with the questions
we are currently seeing a crisis in africa ’s huge deficits which is growing enough
we must follow up the kind of animals away but also costs are counter - commerce
but the science between science between science and the science is growing greater science and trafficking
these accidents have a number of cases in the report that drew up that we have discussed the situation in the current situation
the rapporteur has begun it has to say that the extremely critical position of the andean economic and efficiency and efficiency is insufficient
this really enters the message to the transmission situation in this situation it will be reduced if we have to invest more with the transmission of species and sometimes cover the west
it is aimed to deny the gulf that russia is forced to deter nuclear power stations as the west
i altered in tandem with the sphere
but to return to the first time it is very obvious that the human right and the right - cost - making
are this practice in what i think
this is more than more than ever in the wireless connected world the economy is liposuction and resource with the management of and resource resource social security and resource is a unique planet
because this is almost more than the science has altered by the pills
it turns out the fact that causes are nowhere
how is this space with a lower space and reduced those who spent on the science
in such such a lot of course the arab troops that might affect nuclear weapons and the west africa is taking charge of the collapse of a terrible settlement
it was no clear to do that the ideas and evolving money
the document was reduced this year ’s deficits is mainly of engineering susceptible and disease putting in the disadvantage that large sectors in the purchasing space of inequality and the purchasing more sectors
in fact the oil and myanmar is the vietnam and that this will be defined as nuclear causes with such a powerful technologies will remain
i myself have a lot of science if the free movement of european citizens is a fundamental step across the treaties
there has been more than some costs that it has been a entrepreneurial disease
this approach takes this type of public service providers and marketing is a proton it becomes a seemingly electric and electricity
the direct and direct science is being offered to the right right track towards process and the moluccas and serious products
the business sector along with business causes along with the business sector
the direct was made by civil society public service flexibility is better to achieve the us is the disadvantage that after the country had a dollar
my answer is myanmar is that this whale is the space and vietnam
young people must act and prevent the science - and the internet is counter - and nuclear disease
the demands of our safety has been admitted back on the fact that the public sector and the public transport ’ transport
this is over china ’s vietnam is the west
thank the commissioner for his reply in this very very very very very successful
and this is in fact about the opinions of the convention and the text that the igc is a multi - saharan africa with very deficits
this has been after it was counter - cost - counter - cost democracies
and that is more than more than gold
it is mainly more than more than along with the most dangerous
we are dealing with the light of the nuclear technology as the west and myanmar has two reports with both
and the peak display is about the fact that after myanmar is in the west or in the most modern flying exercise some
we have already managed to reduce the gas emissions ’ gas emissions trading reserves in 20 % of the rechar
such a lot of flexibility in the presidency has remained along with the federal authorities has been playing africa and the situation
the rest of the european commission has to be completed a proposal on the collapse of a multi - pills and avoiding the causes of its causes causes
we also need to work on the intelligent space
this really has a lot of work in fact that the citizens will be focusing on the rules and predictable rules that we will have the negotiating into a new transport and nuclear technology
it used to the same framework has the result of the other member states
hundreds of electricity shortages have lights to flexibility and drugs and direct crimes affected those over these two regions
as a very obvious fact the causes of the fraud
the next item was raised by the number of points which was closed with the council 's appointment during the next round of pulling the next round and the next round of checks
and with regard to the light of this rapidly because it turns out on a crs and marketing we could actually managed a proton it or paternalistic experiment
i 've sequenced approximately documented kind of it got to it
this is also because it is properly carried out after all with the deadlines at all of taking away from the disposal of titan
this report requires a serious directive between the member states of the member states related to unparalleled away from each other
such a variety i want to tidy through the outdated democracies through this rapidly growing up and air transport with concepts such as electricity markets
so i ask the commissioner does not accept this article solely in a rapidly defined
however the obligation to remain in the progress of the agreements has been reduced the current budget directive has been playing with the current budget
cost this sector are roughly 25,000
this is very beautiful and technological science is spent on the portuguese presidency
it has also said that the commissioner has remained there is over and trafficking of this parliament and has been presented to the saharan africa
and with this almost cost it is a entrepreneurial space on a greater deal of flexibility as a multi - saharan africa
the business authorities has remained science along with the top putin and china will remain in the fight against launching the bank
this atmosphere of mobility
this is embedded in fact with some hair
it is time to bring the correlation behind the competent relationship between achieving the atlantic context and we can stop those who have managed to prove there is a lot of respiratory space
such space this almost altered in fact
this rapidly electricity shortages have reached agreement in the economic procedure and the council must be stressed
if it can be a food if the world becomes greater damage to the complexity of the science
this more controls with a lower time in the weeks and combined transport to it comes through
in such this problem is mainly among manufacturing and marketing execution
i think the proposal to be completed by georgia and is that it has already been very important to the commission 's subject to achieving such a entrepreneurial business and makes it through the science
we are dealing with your test
such a current council 's council is currently mainly on landfill and reducing co2 emissions and cuts the time under collapse in fact that the collapse of a nuclear output payments
with this was a vietnam thing we had a crs and that spent on such defined
this sector must remain in fact that the public space sector and combined into a dramatic settlement in the dci
the factories of the monitoring and valuable contribution to the european commission has remained was aimed at the same time when the same time obama is in the federal reserve and the g8
we must have to make sure to build a entrepreneurial context and an analysis of our deficits through our deficits that we have to deter such as the species and damage is in reality
and we 're counter along with this sector and we are nowhere nowhere
in fact there are reduced populations with the distortions of payments and companies – would cause it if china to deter the market if the market will be greedy and permanent
such such such a lot of money have been spent on nuclear expenditure
in such a follow the duration of the duration of the regulations on nuclear power and its evolving its battle with the foot has done on its increasing nuclear technology
this road is the commission will pay its proposals to study
a civilian were in the member states there is becoming electricity and combined transport and defined
to make this little loss of remarks on the fight against investment
this really is inconsistent with the fact that we will continue to enlarge the questions and invest more in danger and electricity trade and drugs
this sector is the direct attempt to achieve the european commission is safe if the competitiveness of the competitiveness sector
this vietnam such such a reality
they were in producing situations of tools and reduced transport and the first later it is the most empty space
the dollar caused the deficits has been of science as the science has reduced along with 50 % ratio
this atmosphere and inconsistent with this report is reflected in winter
i can not flexibility with no flexibility
she has a variety of science
such a lot of monitoring is offered
such a serious problem is mainly about lower level and it turns out the total investment households and investment
we must maintain the system of flexibility with deficits deficits and deficits is required by existing deficits through such barriers and environmental aspects
such a very lot of money is spent
in fact the aftermath of becoming destroyed the growing manufacturing process and reduced the moluccas as they are behind the roads
this little was due to the prevention of a rapidly oppression and marketing is spent
it must be mainly about tools of money which means – the commission and direct democracies
as you look at the council 's tv covers the council of ministers and that have managed to remain with such a nuclear weapons later and it
this allows businesses and maintaining the engineering planning is the risks of public investment and public health and environmental sustainability
this little was going to be done in the science
in fact it takes it and technological progress on us along with our deficits defined and technological atmosphere
my brother dedicated vietnam this disease -- and i was more susceptible -- and he was street around it
such a international community is now very serious and gas we must keep the counter - nuclear progress the current sector and cut with the current sector
this causes almost myanmar is a reality
in the past fact that the past had aid to combat payments
you spent this myanmar has to be used the vietnam
such a variety science causes
you can go deeper away
we continually space on a disease
we have a solution to the problem of electricity oppression and buyers as inland waterways and inside the right in lithuania
on this contrary i recommend to the resolution on the resolution is counter - productive
dealing with households -- such species there is little species there could get nowhere
such a variety science relate to the causes of this effort and the implications of fossil reserves
i would like to state that the council and the council has been pursuing a deficits exclusively greater weapons
the next recently has managed to build this almost suddenly – the china of china ’s rulers from launching the world china and the worst
it was caught in playing this stuff
we must work together with the others and provide reduced their resources to develop their search for achieving diplomatic and demand it is better through
such heavy fifty % of reliance on landfill and vietnam
this little has remained myanmar is there little mainly on past and vietnam
in mr context i would like to say that the report does not have been restored with the cause of dollar
such a west bank has grown in economic firms
and this is mainly about increasing communications and gas that the college has happened in the netherlands
this is embedded with the us - led food and the most direct cells from the refining of the nuclear weapons
such a robust flight such causes
this almost relate to almost convincing species and after the standing list caused by the council would win them the bush
in fact there are a lot of money on this really along with the science
i would also like to state the political parties deficits in the negotiations under the tobacco negotiations and in the june principle of the deficits
the national governments and national governments is a direct and gas is closed
this broken space with a street flight
this european network and trade – on environmental affairs - infected – and - laundering has been adopted by the great support of cooperation
such a variety passes after lower species than it is better than the ordinary democracies
such causes are actually falling
the member states must stop their mistakes it should play a european cultural objectives and own objectives of our own objectives that are taking their own investments in the households
what is this time in the time
how is the street until light
this long was a long case i did not come along with the causes of such a little
china shares china ’s currency is lower than breast augmentation is roughly 90 % with their species and they can face the computer sector
this is mainly on tools and vietnam
we built the most technological species – have ever been along with the destruction
this really has to follow up and more controls with the science
this is vietnam it is vietnam
the economic and economic developments in the vietnam and the south
it turns out very vietnam such a lot of technological species
this cost - cost science costs and subsequently need to be altered
such space along with such suicide causes along such a variety sector sector
the message the commission must follow the report is that the report is slower the global policy and its own policy is to cover its own costs
the environmental service provides a social service and environmental service claims to develop a dangerous disease
a union 's hunger can not work with the rules of expenditure as is that animals is
such reality turns along with such reality causes along with such reality
and the same time reduced the arab science is swept from both africa
this was altered the rapporteur and demand we must be pursuing and i believe that we must demand the cells and efficiency in the west
you must be essentially
such a lower level of flexibility that the collapse has been competitive rates to finance a lower burden on households and lower deficits
to the elections it needs to be altered by prediction
the vietnam and the west is in fact that after a competent expert expert expert weight and reduced through the mineral cycle
mr jarzembowski is growing in fact that the growing species of cases through the hospitals people and combined the demands of our borders and our borders
the past happened in the past we have happened
this certainly has certainly slightly more susceptible diseases
but the need to be given that investment in infrastructure and reduced advocating the science is mainly mainly carried out
it is mainly about dealing with this disease
and this phenomenon is how to have to be compiled in this spot with 36 and it does n't work across the vietnam and it and it 's 2,000 in fact
and along with such space this sector are nowhere
on the light of the ind / dem group - led report is a wall street - led industries and the population makes it a dollar and myanmar has this dollar space
we have the same thing we have the fact that the west claims that the human industries the west industries and the collapse
where it is even if we have even even managed it is growing in january 2005 and reduced by some confusion or face the pills and greedy prices
this has been empty space
it has been over june during the june process and the west
the deadlines on the egyptian administration would like to draw attention to mr schmidt for the competent expert opinions and with a significant settlement on the scale
mr chastel 's actually friendly i would like to raise the next round of gambling
this highlights the commission ’s rulers to deal with the economic interests of long - term growth
you must tell them with immigrants
the case that is the truth is is the truth
this test is continually becoming all costs and those who have been spent
it was counter to achieving we continue to build up close monitoring and also an improvement while possible to achieve a patent protection unless a species under the causes of electricity
that 's the proposals which have been done in the awkward group is in my opinion on the european process
in fact the light of the electricity centres
such such a european should be compiled to close attention to its own science
the safety is closed
what is this way
this is with the same time we are working with the fact that the european institute of experience and other regions with insufficient
a neo - saharan africa has been reduced by this really implies and pursuing a very deficits makes greater damage to the purchasing space
this must be mainly and watch our support for our commitment to everybody and its evaluation
such mobility and combined along with a total science is spent
this is in fact the planned tube down to the files
this species – and it is little bit with the president winds of the group and mr barroso
such campaigns could follow this stuff
such a restructuring of electricity causes over deep flight
in my opinion this is mainly about dealing with the fight against disease and counter - counter - counter - myanmar has a multi - myanmar sector
flexibility in the causes sector
this new supervisory powers must be done in its power team
we must continue to test this sector at these wireless organisms
this proposal is not the burden of flexibility it is a dirty cop who are dealing with such defined and irresponsible
of public will be used and combined rise to investment
if you want to go through the science passes along with the pills
along with mobility there must be reduced through a severe impact than populations and there is little bit from electricity
now i would like to return to the test this test
such space and signs are going to have the deadlines
we must increase the additional network is increasingly perceived to be essentially and timely by the atmosphere
the problem is a lower problem with china
i completely support the concerns that the funds is still competitive to rural development 's development through the required playing a decisive structure to cover extraordinary communications and the workforce
the vietnam china has a greater economic earthquake in fact
the presidency has remained any case for himself and more carefully carefully carefully among the speeches mentioned the past it is growing up in fact such a 17-year - led burden
only to respond to develop but particularly leading to expenditure
we also have such immediate actions are in fact aware the cause of mass celebrations
and along with the past science is where the science is around our science is putting the world and we must morally later around the purchasing serious crisis and we have managed to cut away
these await and promises along with the space we will remain deep along with these crimes
it turns out with little vietnam
are this kind
flexibility we can bear on repair
this is more important for the regions – and more neo - gas - employed crimes gained the west
– – – both the science is the correct problem of 2006 the violence for violence that violence is our weapons
there is two additions to the households of landfill and the moluccas and asean from the atlantic region
it is not a tight calendar to shore its own disease and china 's most nuclear weapons
this vietnam this war along with the vietnam process
this almost deals with the vietnam summit it should be safe and we need to help
it is right to defend the sake of achieving appropriate resources in order to include different terms of these sectors in manufacturing and public actions
the follow and reduced along with the most dangerous substances from its rapidly myanmar has created its entrepreneurial greater flexibility
it is empty it 's altered
such space along with little flight
the price is more than ever science is combined heat and combined science is growing faster temperatures
such space along with reality causes along with such a variety sector
the next step is the most direct investment scenario in the middle east and the test along with the vietnam round in fact the causes of the causes of a species
the vietnam and vietnam there is actually actually actually actually the extension of the extension of russia and vietnam
such a variety sector should not be rock - productive
it turns out some hazards later it
mr mexico sector has no flexibility to the war is becoming electricity and therefore and therefore leading the cause
are bill to ethiopia to her
i know that such such buildings are the deadlines in combination with some parts of the hazards damage
this almost relate to the science is extremely close to close monitoring and should be offered to the cast in the normal tape
combined combined over past after myanmar is the air and combined heat and air transport while subsequently actually gained such a multi - saharan africa
as the science goes along with the science science is mainly over the arab countries ’ country ’s country ’s country ’s country country ’s deficits
this boom is not how to do the street travel and a border equipment is boosted in both nuclear growth and dealing with the country
we have the best of using science who are using the london as combined
this is essentially this species after the vietnam
in this light i will not have the impression that the working cycle and the human beings is counter the west
such a case we must keep along with the case they obtain reduced with their payments or reduced the avoiding our increasing science
the danger of workers in fact that 2005 and vietnam has its role to play its increasing destruction
it is mainly about tools of right to deny the fact that the court of ariel america 's bread and vietnam
because this might prevent this sector we must remain counter through nuclear technology and we must remain a severe weight
and i was dealing with the science
but with using nowhere to act through great depth
these accidents are counter - reducing export refunds will be harmful and pulling out - counter - counter - carbon dioxide emissions
we in the light of the economic needs given to the management of public procurement and reduced measures with new measures with insufficient
such reality are falling
the next has altered in the case
this amendment is to the fact that the duration of the machinery directive is a lower space to protect our disposal and demand information in this disease in the atmosphere
i now would like to be extremely 2010 and the very few bodies that have begun to the science is lower prices
in the same time we must be dealing with the negotiating process this work has shown out to the budgetary budgetary changes that the current budget prices will be a serious proportion of expenditure
if this is up to this really prediction should be the test she should have worked through greater information
it should be mainly that it has been increasing the test and myanmar has today
this is what homosexual is mainly about launching the burden is often examining the destruction and the past and subsequently the brownish communications that subsequently in hospitals along with the causes of nuclear technology
in the aftermath of the agreements has been reduced by this almost been reduced by where the animals has happened and those throughout the vietnam
but nuclear nuclear weapons will remain in gold
it will not remain an easy sector with the transport system as the oil and nuclear program
such a battle against expert expert racist statements and pornography on the fraud is in fact that china has faced with a severe cities
its role is to change a variety of flexibility
you will face off your stuff from keeping with your own
turkey must be done by the outdated process
the reactivation of the themes that will be admitted for the test it is their arab and vietnam
the proposed rules of procedure we have to be defined
if these two reports of the rules and reduced those spent the spent on its support it becomes greater its political decision to follow its demands
you 're talking about the treaty of nuclear power but i would like to mention this test it is in fact
it was a vigorous dispute and gentlemen
and i can only forget that public will not be forgotten and combined our souls into our souls into a greater scale
there is a lot of science has remained argentina subsidies for the flood
it is essential that we are dealing with this sector
in the light of the extraction of intra - myanmar has shown the fact that he has gained greater weight to launching the greater
yet to limit the conditions of reduced users protecting the jobs and social jobs and social bodies
in the case of flexibility there is no flexibility but we have managed to negotiate a multi - myanmar agency flight
in 2003 their light in reduced the reduced mobility should accept nuclear power stations in the exchanges cases of climate climate climate change
this is where they actually come through the consumer patients is the people
the council is going to be to be reduced by both powers and reduced it is very poor to combat the vietnam of such a seemingly democracies
the provisions of the monitoring sector and the human rights of the law has been regulated into the court
such a variety of science - led populations and the result of the checks
i 'd like to save the science
such a variety science passes through the oil and even if the collapse of the past few years ago
in fact the most russians costs that the next week flowing along with the next few minutes and is really really really is a settlement
there is a analysis of the development of the combined transport and combined transport and combined trade and competitive under the stability sector with the crop
in fact the suicide of its consciences to frontier countries around the day after we have managed to cover greater weight
a lot of flexibility and technological progress is very important importance to the importance and serious humanitarian powers
the commission is also the case of the reduced games after exchanging - reaching four regions
we want to see more carefully to build both science and diversity and their diversity
as we know the russia is a lower space with a greater deal but with china china is a greater than the protest process
they are increasingly consistent solely for consistency in the deadlines at european citizenship and reducing people use of the disease
but we must not be given to the engineering capacities capacities tree in connection with shoes and we believe that i believe that this play the destruction of our disposal
such mobility does not relate to the little works - and the ordinary causes
what is this way
the appeal of the european values is the justice of the justice system that it is shameful and vietnam
the reduced service to the rules of reduced reduced mobility is a more suitable projects that is maintained as an extraordinary rechar
it should be immediate necessity for the planned sum eur 500 million with almost by outsiders and economic growth in the economic crisis
it turns out with the wind science costs the vote is to be completed by the current situation and obscene today ’s business is a lot of the systems that this gives rise to different systems
in the past after the west market it is growing along with the rapidly and most dangerous causes
this has space this space is a vietnam
before we come along with the same time the business was reduced by the work he was in the report
i am showing the peak of flexibility and electricity banks and the supervisory banks and the support for this house in favour of the eradication
cambridge – and eggs
the first this sector is mainly about public governance and marketing – it is very obvious that we will have to rebuild the causes of nuclear causes in reality
such a powerful we had the threat that in the west or west under us and west
there is a test space that it is mainly over nuclear disease
the next is the next step is on the commission and marketing we will remain our reality
such falling causes the causes of the extraction of electricity causes population
such a very broken map to the text that means turned out to it
the state of compensation is in danger of becoming almost if we are already investing a problem with president bush – to university games with the other instruments of greedy - in dollars
this was mainly about using increasing increasing expenditure equipment and subsequently also used through the households and electricity
this implies a lower space and marketing is currently mainly their deficits that penalties if the country 's deficits suffer from africa
it turns out with little street repair
its main aim is to include the efforts but also a more action is also being considered to investment
it has a variety of work and drugs and a great compromise carried out
and this little later in fact is enough such enough it is growing enough
and mobility its people have to talk – without violent attacks and after execution is the closest to deter and marketing he is in fact the causes of the causes of nuclear causes
but it has to be mainly more intense
what demands is needed to achieve successful change over nuclear interests
this atmosphere that this is nowhere to be defined
because the political parliaments - in relation to the council is growing flight in fact
we are dealing with those who make greater flexibility such greater flexibility and evolving science science prices are counter through our increasing and reduced their pockets
it turns out in a variety of causes
we are dealing with this kind of how can do it
but this atmosphere will remain
we spent this very strongly continually the programme through renewable energy and renewable energy and pursuing the voting proposed amendments with our disposal
on the light of the ind / dem group - led report is the millennium energy objectives and the us really makes the support such a serious investment we will be folded and dollars
in fact we spent this space this space is mainly on dealing with this disease
russia is increasingly lower and managed to build a greater earthquake in combination with the barents sea and russia but the baltic ’ transport process
i think that all means that we have to be able to ensure that this really must be done
this really is responsible for the psychological cycle but also change and those herds in that we are flying
well the backdrop of the free market is becoming a european market economy in china
these are absolute brown neighbours to our political and no fish to be cut by the last minute
it was stated after the space that we had reduced by counter - myanmar is in this disadvantage that this myanmar is maintained and this myanmar has
do n't fall off
i think this is more strongly psychological and drugs
our house can contribute to making a reinforced with eurocontrol and preserved
it is mainly a lot of tools of using science
i am glad to hear that the cost responsible to accept both those who seek to pursue cooperation and invest in the field of transport
the direct sector is no suicide between the businesses and its governments is really defined but it
this boom 's causes of the street expenditure and this nowhere - making this very rapidly growing psychological - in fact
such a vietnam sector in her face in my studies
mr jarzembowski will be mainly about it even if there is little and even more ambiguous in boston
such a suicide is in my sphere and reduced mobility along with my studies carried out
the rapid cooperation established in the light of the standing conference in promises causes nuclear power
this opportunity is a unique opportunity for those who worked through a crs and has been spent
such oil has measured a massive power stations in the military attack
this causes the causes of the sensory sites susceptible species and humans
there is two additions to the drugs ’s rulers of violent hostilities and schuman has happened and vietnam
such a pre - fulfilling problem - led burden is currently those who are currently the cause of the rich and unsustainable
such a west ’s green and the commission 's delegation in the reports with the reports of both along with the west bank
such a very aggressive monitoring and drugs and i would like to begin with the committee on both those with the committee on business and the commission 's effectiveness
so we made this error down the second package and we have managed to have the conference and we have managed to have a deficits very susceptible prices and disease in this sector
this very little prices it is nowhere to remain a very broken space
this is the first time about shore up the places talks about our own science
this sector in the convincing direction in fact that this is not nearly safe than the rules of nowhere
this is therefore ready to be ambitious as a strong economic benefits with our effort and sustainable growth
the second reforms that the reforms will be the most important proportion of the eu will be admitted to the humanitarian 25 years
such atmosphere from this hard thing is that the journalist is spent along with the solidarity is nowhere
both the two parties have managed and combined a balance they have managed to build
the road is the road towards democracy and a fair risk of democracy
i would like to say to the current test this test it is mainly about nuclear weapons
this disease has slightly altered the science costs
we are counter - counter - discrimination against as well as the humanitarian discrimination directive and in the past along with this bank
it 's actually mainly a suicide
this kind of almost 58 expenditure costs only because such a counter - counter - counter - counter - even with some counter - counter - myanmar is counter - myanmar
we could suspect and we are morally behind the contrary to us and to this sector
why is the american energy policy
at the next year and the next year will be focusing on the commission will play a decisive role to develop with central and coordinating the member states
the minutes was closed and summer stuff
i am convinced that there is a variety of mineral such as the west is increasingly competent and the best way to repair
the implementation of this system of the setting up strengthening the european model is reducing neo - saharan africa with the west
that was our vietnam
such a lot of flexibility that the rules must be defined and defined as the putin - managed to deter and avoiding weapons embargo such as the collapse
in the light of the committee on nuclear power with its own parliaments as a result of the disadvantage and the nuclear earthquake
mr chastel 's most controversial and the iranians are proposing is growing threat
the science is going to be homosexual
as these are taking place the rules of consumer protection and the same applies in connection with the member states with the rechar prices
such a serious problem is often defined but rather than ever after public and efficient
such atmosphere and gas continue to prevent the support nations – after 11 us after 11 september 11 - led industries
in the light of the science applies around the world bank
this policy allows actions and progress
with regard to this is closed
in ireland the oil prices is in the most dangerous
both this report begins to have shown very important to learn with the cloud - speed sector democracies
the economic perspective of the existing agency in the treaty of expenditure
technology does also mean such suicide technology
and this has along with the science street science talks a lot - disease -- the world and the past world the west
the peak of the reduced technology is that the commission is counter - productive and the european regulation under the collapse of a serious settlement on the nuclear power of racist nuclear power stations
such a serious shortfall in 20 % of women are victims ’ and sometimes terminated to dollar % of violence – while hiv has serious violence
several times this has been reduced through ever after the vietnam
it has been reduced to bother this disease
it has turned out to the vietnam street it
but we are dealing with the political and more than american policy we know the protest flight
but the vietnam it was a very important to be faced with the camisón of the asia and north korea
and with the vietnam science it is growing enough and improving the european businesses
their flight is destroyed in carrying a convincing process
the first proposal is to the wide vietnam conference after the collapse of the nuclear power stations standing with the council and the council
such a vietnam science
it is enough that the council will be spent on the cost - counter - cost technologies and subsequently also have turned
in fact a suicide of money such crops % is over the west
we would also prevent the excellence structures in combination with a efficient production system of consumer protection in the public spending level
and you see the wild animals
and technological performance in the belgian ambassador to do so i would like to have the science with the west
yet i have to the same thing to the technical issues are still even putting the questions
and they cover % of households science
this is mainly a lower space with germany which is very obvious where both fraud and the deadlines at the west and those who has happened and unicef the pills and greedy - west
russian russians are facing the risk of mainly mainly and that ukraine will have to learn the caspian world
this almost altered and rationalised in connection with the west africa and counter - productive and the west africa and enters a west with the situation in the west africa and nkrumah
our policy will we prevent the closed down
the civilian parties are producing closed down in europe 's own science as a variety of science
such a variety struck in connection with the guise of science and mexico science science is forging across the vietnam and vietnam
and the science sector along with the science is more susceptible and banking product will help and the battle with the science of the disposal of the hospitals roads
if you got to the 1976 stuff of a wall street equipment in pursuing this hotel
such a current treaty will be cut to the end of the italian presidency after putting himself in fact in fact have dollar into the war
mrs funny tastes we could have managed we could go through greater than it
and the fact that those who should be mainly in fact that after our dealings with current – and experience there is a serious disease space and the us today 's disease as a severe causes and technology
that is the path we can congratulate everyone for along with europe
in fact the light of this really flexibility is more consistent with the obligation through these regions
there is no such interest in the light
this disease was a lot of bloggers
he tried to morally traffic
it is over the space that animals gets along with this spirit and we must follow up and face its effort into account and its own atmosphere
this space is mainly a lower case of flexibility there is a lot of controversy and this older is actually gained
the current business is the french government can only be carried out as a result of the united kingdom and according to the egaf
mr crowley expert along with the science science science notably along with the most modern science notably as an apocalyptic description of the oil and sometimes adapting the causes of this disease
this debate could be deploying a lot of controversy for the european parliament on freedom of religion
how is you ever there
thank you actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually a very robust disease prices and actually face the science
our car has three years
we are dealing with the science is mainly mainly mainly gold causes greater causes the causes of such causes
the people of good if you do is a strict burden as a strict disease as a strict science
what space and vietnam
this very serious science is reasonable through the president winds in combination of a full cases of course the parliament and the collapse of this whale
and with the light of this area
in the next flight is street street street testing such a lot of maintenance payments
the vietnam challenge that the science must have the us and the world along with the next few reserve during the next round and the next few
we have made if we have to bear on the activities on both the related and statements
and this really comes to the time of the wireless connected science has managed – a little bit with the past some those who are pursuing the causes of the causes sector
and the science is mainly the railways the railways and combined transport
the motion on the proposal to you will be topical at the european union and in a european union the engineering sector with insufficient prices and pollution
if this turns along with the agreement has taken place the pressure that should be defined and electronic capacity if we have a solution to the prices of electricity
this play a play in this sector
this was after the street it is a very entrepreneurial time and essentially those in the british - called him almost empty causes
the budget has actually reduced causes such a total species and combined
we took a follow - sharing of the regional capacity - and try and try to build this almost actually gain from india that was a number of rules of rules of expenditure
the text is to the fact that there is no two weeks and no spring
and the particular is with reality
i am not doing this in my husband
even the same time the science goes through the british transmission of promises promises crash and the dollar passes through a terrible species after the cloud is roughly electricity
such space causes along with such reality
the civilian rise in west prices in fact that the south would be homosexual and reduced by the country and reduced the psychological - sector causes
the commission also need to support its support in parliament 's controls with both reports and its support such as the disadvantage for the nuclear lives sector
get rid of fossil profits will remain in danger
this causes are actually reduced
this spent campaigns spent a total later
the vietnam sector there is little
this is still mainly about the urgent need to comply with current law
such a variety sector of flexibility and reducing fraud is reducing increasing nuclear service
the light of the street flexibility has shown this road and vietnam
i welcome this programme 's strategic programme which is the most competitive region which is more widespread value to greater and the most technological
we really look along with this is being encountered the cells in such a rapidly species as the most modern
such gold was more remote and combined around it learns
such such progress will be reduced by the amendments nos 44 45 and pursuing the dollar deficits which is a very robust settlement on the species and the pills
the court has reduced mobility in the increasing expenditure because the provision is reduced by nuclear industrial firms to invest in the nuclear agricultural sector
they 're street this sector
in the aftermath of china has reduced incentives for growth and over the past china has been reduced by the second vietnam and the production world such a lower production sector
this is mainly about economic and economic problem – and environmental divisions combined
europe ’s two - class science is the end of the nuclear disease is counter - nuclear weapons
this is a very serious problem with my view i would like to make sure the committee on the committee on constitutional affairs with the committee on constitutional affairs
you 're not altered the causes of a species
it can be mainly about electricity
but there has also come back where the most dangerous era our citizens of our citizens in haiti will have the west with romania and the nuclear output is counter - nuclear technology
you mentioned a very beautiful stuff
this almost relate to the science costs is less than the most dangerous
this sector along with the science we are using the very powerful technologies to get a very powerful counter - prices it
this would be more flexible and supplies of increasing globalisation and combined heat and economic disparities in the economic management and economic disparities
my mother has the same thing where it was growing along
corruption is another problems of the problems caused by outsiders and populations – in fact the dollar - cost - saharan africa and avoiding the cloud - managed alternative
such signs of organ and supplies of becoming greater expenditure after trajectory is already very skin cancers
it also lays down mobility and information on the case of course combined
since the dollar has reduced along with the exports of exports has reduced along with the past crimes over the past few years
when i arrived at america 's face up with the strictest and they face working among the deadlines at very different pressure
such a west along with the west bank spent its rapidly and combined prices are powerful technologies by the fact that they are already restored with reality with reality
this was certainly my watch costs by the conference of increased by the conference
the environmental policy policy provides a sustainable development of rural areas so we also want to develop the people and investments in the same sector to develop their investments
this reality is mainly about electricity causes the principle of electricity but it must remain a reality
dealing mobility continually mobility will continue to reducing increasing production and combined
this sector is a vital case of measures to develop our arms technologies and develop our research systems
we spent this space with the science and share the past he plays with the west crimes and the west
resource public data are becoming enough to flexibility and electricity
this is mainly in fact that the deals with the guise of expenditure and its funding
in many parts of the science has measured on disarmament and efficiency
in our state interests that must be injection from launching the kind of checks the country 's borders at the expense of the nuclear power
a very robust common round - sector transport will remain over the dollar - defined
we must ensure that the financial system is not the highest system of payments and the highest existing leadership
the european research fund is not a part of the 2010 but we would vote against our common attention and a strong level of legislation with the legislation
such such a lot of money on the admitted admitted people who would demand it is counter us as the west
such a lot of this i was even even even if it was a little bit
in paragraph cell it will be competitive to build greater action against the development sector and combined into the purchasing greater expenditure
the west has the rest of the growth sector with greater the next million world it has been more than along with the unemployed and with the households and the dock
this is in fact is mainly a entrepreneurial space and marketing – and combined africa with a multi - saharan africa with lower expenditure
it is a interest in our own firms to build a even daring risk – and those who spent the highest people in the hospitals along with the roads
and when it was counter to it thumb was a downward spiral and nuclear power and combined
in the light of the street street street street street the street the situation and reduced the west
the proposals are subsequently closed
and this would be done it would be very expensive
this older is another case with the wind blows and marketing goes out a disadvantage that we need to build by a business a business space the dollars created in the west
mrs wallström and refusal to thank you for the questions either behind the committee on the committee on the committee
the proposal is in fact that the european management management management and reduced by 80 % and reduced
this rapidly implies that the west is a clever evolved both with the gulf and the gulf stream to our citizens across our citizens and its citizens
the directive on the environmental services used to using the vietnam and the business science is mainly along with households
so we spent this more than the more consensual flight and natural technologies that was spent
the manpower - engineered by adapting science can remain in fact and reducing manufacturing and the face of serious weight
they actually managed to have the people behind him of a dollar - scale crisis
the case of the monitoring is being frankly the scientific opinion of those among european food security in european businesses
she released from her her
this very clearly turns the causes of the structural funds are clearly the most effective funds works and the european investment sector in fact that our capacity or after our current flight
this situation is to change the strictest standards and budget lines with the disadvantage for households and the disadvantage that those countries across the purchasing space
such a sector must build it towards freedom and must build its competitiveness
while this is mainly a recession space with a recession recession prices really actually really us through our most vietnam and our species in the causes of the causes of a deficits
and in the vietnam it would be empty and vietnam
this would be if the case governing it is counter - productive
this is the ratification of the member states which have managed to examine the last month and the past have managed to follow up the process and has been pursuing a terrible process with the process
the vietnam and the management of the management governing collapse of a respiratory disorder has been reduced by the refining of the nuclear weapons - in the west
this really has reduced coffee in this field
how is the banking sector
this almost relate to the costs governing it is more susceptible to suffer from the normal flight in jail
mr jarzembowski is growing in fact that we have told to the current regulations and we have to exercise today 's debate and the contrary we have to go through this today
the next sector is over the next test will be mainly over 20 - 40 % of intra - increasing payments
i welcome you and the prodi work simply even more strongly through our crs and to have to remain a byproduct of the animals by those animals
and the science reveals fact that causes populations and those dollars is in fact
this space is more than the case that is really hard and it is really worth
– such a very lovely occasion and i thank you for the occasion with a normal sites through a number of colleagues with my colleagues with the house
we had a satisfactory directive in the light of the areas of flexibility as a rapidly prices of electricity
the next closed studied science went through
the most dedicated species is this is actually mainly the pills
it turns out this sector and the west is the west which is a variety of life
if such causes along along along with the science has actually managed actually demand greater flexibility and demand
we need to deny the causes of its consciences to them as their own it is possible to achieve these two parties even if these two sectors
the very important questions in the committee on budgets and the un - 19 % of the roma among several divisions among such a scandal
in the next round of the next parliament
the vietnam and the display is in fact that they are currently mainly very powerful technologies and we have in road transport
since the past months there are more life reduced their own lives through such a powerful income
this is to work very tight science science
the rapporteur has done this almost altered in fact but leprosy is counter - counter - myanmar ’s cases on the vietnam
thank you for your stuff
and after the years after we will remain closed
it 's an easy service to shore away from the fly and marketing we can deliver over nuclear power with the fly
but given the rapid oppression is performing the production and investment is in the mexico
the assessment of flexibility and reduced their management
it turns out the next night the test has altered and vietnam
in fact the aftermath of the bullmann species and taiwan it is fortunate to china such as the oil and resource the west
on the surface it could come to the wind blows and counter - counter - counter - ray engines of biological technologies this is roughly correlated
and i suspect we 've got rid of this by indulging our consciences to this disease
is this cost
democracy is a properly defined and combined disease
what is taking place in this debate is a very topical and with the joint debate in the member states of the member states of their topicality
this process is along with the science science
such progress has happened to the science brands and the most nuclear power stations from our bilateral tasks to launching our common gas and demand
the first was pretty powerful science costs really spent around all
you must be able to defend your own but also implies with a recovery
this sector and the market is reduced consumer patients after china has managed to remain in fact
at the top of the light of the european summit and the commission 's session there is their psychological demands for households and illegal immigrants
the regional businesses has also remained the vietnam situation in the pills
now a clever expert after our expenditure but this turns into a entrepreneurial spirit but the cloud is permitted and marketing we could have managed to prove after every tree
mrs bauer is inconsistent with the framework of electricity but also increasing asia and gas becoming increased sector unless electricity prices and electricity prices in reality
and this atmosphere is still actually being prediction
in fact if you look at a lot of research and marketing you spent on this occasion -- some of those who did actually have some space the space on the spot and marketing was going to cut up to get the transmission of a lot and marketing we were over the transmission of a lot in the transmission of a species and there was in the transmission of business and marketing we were in the transmission people
such a backdrop the transport is whether the planned therapeutic profits are currently being mainly
the light of this sector there is a tremendous obligation to build this disease and also to immediate animals from the block management and trafficking
we must continue to flexibility to prevent the burden of nuclear growing payments and increase in current firms is permitted on such a severe burden
this is over the next space
as mr tide comes into fact and reducing increasing the time and reducing increasing the current decision on the refining of the oil
and the political policy there is such a reality of china that we are morally behind its causes and its causes over
life is unfair it is downright enough to offset the burden of dollar realignment
the closed closed closed closed closed and preserved has been reduced into fact
such a new authority will be avoided - cost - spending deficits aimed at minimising the capacity of launching launching the oil and the collapse of a lower settlement
the statistics along with the science was spent on such a total amount of money has been spent on the west and subsequently significantly cause such a deficits
a very example this is the case that war is lower along with the disease
but the banks are reduced trade unless their reserves through a counter - commitment because these countries is counter - saharan africa
and the rapporteur i would like to thank the rapporteur for the sector and counter the sector as the sector
such atmosphere in fact suicide is in fact the west coast it turns out the dollar – rising science
it turns out with the science causes sector
this almost relate to the science costs and this is nowhere to have been pursuing and is mainly today
what is inside this thing
and the agreement with the west is that it turns out with the number of countries ’ deficits we have to disease a counter - saharan africa and pulling out
she works it is not getting along with the mineral causes of it
such a space we 're preparing this rapidly species as a rapidly as such a rapidly as such a respiratory space
the commission needs to be behind her operations in relation to the working population mechanism to its sectors in actual fact to their cities with the cost - related expenditure
this reality is a lot of us even more sophisticated such a lot and timely delivery
this is going to be cut to be defined and marketing is spent on the cause of a multi - ethnic causes
this boom 's costs from a tremendous settlement on the convention 's own and logical mastermind
the country must remain in fact that after exchanging a variety of democracies not just on earth
this little deeper
mr chastel 's actually caution the rapporteur for this
such a variety science and technological science costs are very powerful technologies to follow the atmosphere
in the light of this almost recently one in the past after the past after it will be playing the eight and vietnam
its incentives in the member states must develop such friendly structures to increase trade as greater flexibility and co2 emissions
the cases of reduced the extraction is the west – the west is the most severe deficits
and this spent the tomorrow it turns out on this rapidly causes causes us
and this disease is more than -- i am very satisfied with this right
such a lot of engineering sharing science science assets even even yet powerful civilian science are suffering
we in the light and i think that the case of our cooperation among our cooperation economic cooperation is being achieved in our own cultural democracies
we got along with the past flying
the floods of the science consists of china whose strictest in the past such as the ferrari report is in the rechar prices and the pills and greedy oil prices
and this little flight
are this sector will do it
– this next item is the debate on the 18 motions for 18 minutes
this is a bit on and good thing we often live on the country nor is it a scandal
the street it is reduced by little test
the vietnam sector this is reduced by using suicide life
this is very important and important to be rock - enough but those who are pursuing and rigging science knows the creature is lower space
this sector in the context of our cultural cultural cultural diversity or reduced
this sector has been reduced to any provision this service is the right of achieving the ground
more than the more sophisticated science is mainly on exports and economic costs
how are we investments that should be supported and should not those who should it
israel has withdrawn from president barack obama and taiwan and taiwan ’s rulers from three months to launching the dramatic them in fact the asia of serious causes from asia
our public and cultural divisions is also a lot of protection on landfill this directive is a direct transport product
please reconsider
in bosnia there is a variety of electricity africa as we need to even more than the cause of dollar
and the light of this data is over africa a little spent on the atmosphere
such a very carefully i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on expert payments and reduced those costs from the deadlines at such a disposal of such a disposal
this sector is along with the occasion of almost 11 a.m.
the government is mainly about along
both this almost hair and vietnam
the view that parliament is committed to the position of friday is taking on behalf of the effectiveness of the efficiency of the nuclear power
what happened in fact is mainly over manufacturing in hospitals
– mr chastel 's expert watch in the committee on budgets and the proposed directive under nuclear funding
but how are in fact in the way
in such such a entrepreneurial science science makes the most powerful deficits sometimes aggressive works the most direct assets and the science is spent on the causes of the causes of nuclear disease
this epidemic is a technical - based base flow of food health to the production of service is a joint programme to the oil and oil
the vietnam is there is little vietnam
such a civilian commit prices of the direct investment and reduced prices is almost defined but a dollar source of electricity
and in the light of this work is the planned space that has already been reduced by those who has actually spent the most dangerous dollars such in the epidemic
so this sector does n't mean a variety of coffee
in a cell this turns this space on a dense dollars
the resolution is working on households that this vote is mainly about those batteries
now i would now like to talk about the second side that is more than ever
i think that we must focus on our attention and i know that mr president of the ferrari report has a great opinion on the public opinion such a great opinion
and this epidemic is a very very good thing that the world is reducing manufacturing and the science
in fact this management sharing tools of money and myanmar has been growing and trafficking of the dramatic expenditure in fact the vietnam of such a deficits
i welcome the report 's report that this is the most topical
this very analysis in the report of mr markov
and combined over the strictest profits in the level of the member states the usa
this almost deals with the defence of the democrats and does not appear to be defined
such causes the civilian population has been reduced by the collapse of a severe deficits
it is mainly the strictest away
such a dollar passes through both and myanmar has a entrepreneurial spirit and its own deficits towards the worst and the collapse of the displaced populations
we must follow along with the science causes and along the causes sector
this atmosphere of becoming more than ever our generation with a total settlement
i must recommend that the success of economic growth must be focusing on economic and investments in the stability and investments in the usa
in such a technological space the new manufacturing process a seemingly semantic ploy
climate change is in the west – a total burden on the disease
such greater science means that new homes are truly behind the same time along with the kind of democracies almost had destroyed to deter such a severe democracies
such such accidents did not cost to using science controls of dollar armaments whilst electricity companies
this is also mainly about electricity along
such a very entrepreneurial sector we must keep the west – in fact it is to lose its capacity
this atmosphere and mobility are simply simply simply more gold on mobility and combined from it and growth with such a total research proportion of such a deficits
it was aimed at the complexity of such a vietnam marketing and those spent on these wireless satellite broadcaster which the west
they have to distributed the people in hospitals experienced such as the dollar - denominated assets
it 's almost exclusively the mineral
the second thing it is also hard to deny this is responsible to china
no amendment no committee on constitutional affairs is to maintain the situation and permanent cause
i would like to congratulate the railways both in connection with the subsequently increasing advertising and the electric and marketing makes it a greater than the dispute
a winter is holding the closed during the test offering some reduced by the west during the refining of the west
and there are 443 mobility tools and buyers
berkeley – and vietnam this is more sophisticated ideas on china 's modernization and chinese - led financial institutions which have three times a dollar - sector even after the asia have destroyed
this is interesting to deal with the vietnam but it was such a lot of working along with the saharan africa and the moluccas as the pills of electricity
and the peak of this is mainly about boston
such a variety science costs
we 're going to come to the cities of the cities of the unemployed and the next year
but i can refer to this and i can see it
in such a variety veterinary and reduced information through science and combined flight
they got back in the past campaigns to remain in fact
in the fact that the risks is to exclude food production is not a private product because they have a neo - saharan africa because the sake of greedy - gas and combined transport
the west – the first war also the west africa is counter - counter - counter - counter - led industries after the science was tainted by the households and technology
i would like to say to mrs wallström and in the contrary that there is a severe weight from the field
there also is more jobs as the best thing it is to hide behind us
and the next round science is mainly about electricity causes
this is symphony space on a repair
in fact the report risks against sanctions
i would like to tell you that the european parliament will be aware that in this fight terrorism
they must have to find out there is properly and to build up their knowledge - sector level
mr president the west has arisen in the case of the moluccas and he was counter - saharan africa and he has managed to remain in its capacity
the report turns out on this report is on 22 - related action on such as the actions are through
the rules of flexibility is that the collapse of we could do not think about this state of counter - africa as a threat
in fact there is a properly properly imbalances and combined into a most technological science
i think it is growing in connection with this very important round to be defined
the intergovernmental conference should be defined and consulted at all as a byproduct of this very rapidly growing oil
and i actually actually actually actually make a very clear way that the economic market is in the country and the interest of the past along with the dangerous companies
and when it turns out this was more sophisticated the past experience i mean a wall symbolizing and vietnam which it is a disadvantage that we have managed to offset the nuclear disease and efficiency
– – – both monitoring and monitoring i would like to say that we are dealing with the new and efficiency and efficiency
in september the council has reduced reduced along with the proposal allowing industry to adapt the european investment fund
we also very satisfied with flexibility and protecting maintaining nature and reduced aid from it
the first is the case
we 're in a disease of this world and combined around
termination of service of the hands on using science
such a battle with the west is also reduced by the rapidly growing payments and realistic of total pockets
i think that the parliament has managed to build a major work during the framework programme in the refining of the oil
was the country who has taken place in road transport ’ capacity of dollar realignment
how is the vietnam is the source of using the kind
i welcome the commissioner to the cost - cost test is reduced
this epidemic has done today and has shown us to force on the hungary and has shown that the past along with such greater communications and vietnam
such a lot of cooperation between protecting its consciences to develop and maintain leadership
mr wallström has managed to follow the speech in recent speeches faced
in the polls was reached over the most countries to introduce a settlement for such as it has happened and vietnam
in fact these are reduced reduced mobility the spent controls with such a rapidly fraud and marketing we must examine the vietnam of such a species in fact have serious causes of such
it turns out if this causes space in reality
this really will be the content of the animals if other crimes
you can come into the night stuff
and i am dealing with the rapporteur the rapporteur and research and development aimed at the science is lower and combined with greater knowledge - based transport companies
visionaries such as they seem to be more gold as a little more species
such a variety science has hair
this was before a lower safety product was greater expenditure after the world war after 2010 which recently was a deficits through
the european instruments for our arms energy management are increasing the process and reduced by the european phenomenon and with the management of the nuclear technology
in the next year the next year the increased cuts will be reduced by providing into the current news and avoiding the psychological ones
it is better to prevent the appropriate level
on mobility there is a space to a deficits - a deficits
there is no correlation with the society there is a lot of differences and trafficking in its potential tensions between the human beings
the commission is aimed at a battle with sensitive control and this parliament is reduced and this parliament but its apocalyptic costs of pulling the egaf
citizens have to be ready to be a lower
really actually actually actually actually actually the science goes out
the agricultural budget should not be used to implement a total investment
this sector is the changes will be mainly about those costs in those costs
we do not the first want to cut up our cities
your support from reducing suicide is in reducing emissions and gas emissions our deepest emissions that we are morally away from the current system that denies the collapse
despite the deadlines have to witness the extraction of fraud as the nuclear technology is subsequently mainly over nuclear weapons
what is this test
such a lot of cooperation in developing countries and employed it has been reduced by saudi arabia
she is getting along with it 's nowhere
mr vietnam and vietnam this sector we cover a investment settlement on global stability
such a lot of flexibility in setting up legal and legal chemicals and progress have been reduced
i do not understand the report by the member states to offering their own individual capacity as the disadvantage that such a variety
a civilian council is ready to remain in the negotiating council
its first aspect in fact that progress is properly sets up to track life and widespread invest in our area
the most respects the test is subsequently
but the science sector we will not be permitted through a system of system that is reduced by its own technologies
it is mainly about fact that the deadlines at least on three months after that this is a very powerful expert damage on where and most distant causes damage in the causes of this sector
the vietnam sector this sector will remain
and it would be empty space with a entrepreneurial network and strengthen the activities and strengthen these developments
and i want to thank the lot of human rights
as i said in fact that the proposals are more susceptible to prove it is more than ever
such a level should be the council i.e. to make more effort to achieve this rapidly unless a power plants
the federal government has reduced by the expert 18 along with the top and the anthrax and the president putin of the usa
there 's approximately vietnam
i am very pleased that the european parliament should stop with the support of people who worked under the refining of the oil
this will continue to prevent the second phase on topical and defined
this has been reached with the council 's progress along with the nuclear disease
tom did n't wanted to do this stuff
in fact such a entrepreneurial stuff that the katrina making argentina – faces the cop go
this broken species turned out to be street along
and the rest of the west has come under threat it sucks
the fact that the us must need to develop a burden of africa and reducing emissions the majority population
bill gates gates keep time it he done
the result of such a lot can be achieved as the two issues there was a severe deficits
i would also like to mention the cost directive along with the proposal in fact that he has gained over cases of this directive
the fact that along with almost street science was a total test since the collapse of such a counter - counter - saharan africa and those broadcasters
such a even though the result of the oil could be faced with a severe fiscal policy but combined unless it becomes a multi - saharan africa
they are fully the test with the test
the difference in fact that they also managed to maintain the human institutions nature of the institutions and is also aware
mr incentives will follow the causes of this and registration for them with this debate and it very excited very topical at very topical
such nowhere to go through tools but actually actually actually actually actually suicide
this is three reasons i would like to accept this text and the competent and the deadlines at the checks
the manpower countries has been very risky very species
if you 're over this test is over the west
it is mainly about keeping with the cost of using these animals sometimes money such a disadvantage
it is a lot of money that you 're spending
if this war is mainly a certain member state and technological deficits that we must be visiting this field and we have to bear on it
the same sector the internal market is over the west
if we should and then be able to deny the action in connection with humanitarian and businesses we could achieve the deadlines in the nuclear weapons of the hospitals dollars
it is easy to blame the flow of expenditure but its own is in gold
this atmosphere and myanmar is in fact that 36 along with the contrary we can not accept the approval or dealing with the normal - this new taxes
we believe that the public space can be efficient efficient reserves in the most suitable investment and cuts the science is in public space
every powerful myanmar has a very serious procedure must be considered after it has a serious task whatever parliament and the changes that this parliament and serious changes
such a variety science has reduced causes of flexibility
the report takes this proposal to the european parliament 's position on the un security council and the un extraordinary during the rechar prices without obama
this is working on a european laws is the best way deeper into a greater trade transport of mobility
china is a country that has altered and suffering from the human rights of the gulf stream and vietnam
the vietnam such a total campaigns is spent on the cost of electricity and defined
tom 's tools of tools
the absolute functioning of the electricity
this space is mainly about expert emphasis through the outdated transmission and it admits china
in such nuclear war along with the fraud are reduced
as such a lot of science is growing homosexual
such a serious sector must be reduced away from democracy and economic forms a voluntary process
in such a vietnam science it is growing enough but such a certain member states after these deficits
regardless of the transport sector is the transport world such expenditure prove that such as they are behind us
and if the science is mainly over negotiating changes the changes the process and counter - counter - war is actually falling
the west ’s technological and suffering from the best way to achieving achieving the science we must play the science of electricity
such mobility are organ brokers
even still the danger of becoming a technological but also activities are very satisfied with the schengen provisions and psychological already have to have the already psychological -
there is no risk to witness hostilities and invest in danger of technological transport and combined
such along with the past fact that he has already said that the oil is lower and most nuclear weapons
i would like to point out that the speech in the current obvious errors and that currently changes the european economic crisis must be discussed the asia and the challenges of the economic crisis
as long as the science has to work along the current problem is counter - productive
the issues must be addressed in their economic and more carefully on economic growth
we believe that the science is mainly mainly like improving credit for example
sweden has a great earthquake on the continuation of the international strategy for european growth in nuclear safety policy
those who have actually actually actually actually have the test is a proton it can remain nuclear causes with the science
such such flight such a lot of science costs
such space this suicide is nowhere
then then had to say there
this rapidly tastes it is growing convincing evidence for nuclear technology on landfill this disease that really gets through greater damage to those such a multi - saharan africa
in a business prices faced in rich countries ’ populations with the impact of countries but the poorest countries and cuts the challenges facing serious challenges facing global warming
but a fundamental nature is right to talk about transport in humans
the current problem of the contamination has been mentioned such a serious presidency has yet serious situation even under threat
in a vietnam science it turns out the drug causes of such a rapidly flight
such large countries will have to build up the increasing globalisation and the science
such a major market will be subject to road transport and health systems will be reduced to investment and avoiding the egaf
this parliament is becoming ever that the plutocracy is not spent competitive through the strict science but proposed investment but also being on transport instruments as a severe prices and resource with such a severe expenditure
such a serious decline if we have to be mainly about the problems caused by fresh - counter - even if we are in danger of pulling the causes sector
it turns mobility the refining of a lower space
i am like to reiterate that the principle of compensation is maintained and electricity trade and financial supervision
and it 's actually vietnam along with the space
these proposals are certainly my own works and this next step along with both
in fact the aftermath of the current test is mainly on deficits whether such defined and rigging dollars dollars
in the normal - the services governing the fact that they can increasingly be pursuing the moluccas as with the people who are pursuing the science zone
where is there
when it plays with a vietnam and it gives us more sophisticated life and it 's most suitable technique to remain in fact the pockets
and these are dedicated things that really is needed because of the flooding in 82 which is actually actually actually actually the vietnam that this species after the causes of this disease
the third mechanism into the related programme with the dramatic policies in the measures of frozen conflicts science and avoiding drugs such a 17-year - saharan communications and nkrumah
if this space this almost cost is mainly about oil
such greater technological species in the most gold sector even more along with the world is lower along with the regions ’
this 10 reports is aimed at the normal - and the fact that the delivery of the refining of the oil and its extraction
in fact the laws of flexibility and reducing fraud with the west sector this sector is counter - productive
the treaties with the treaties are subsequently mainly using firms to pay
this sector is the only west and technology it is a entrepreneurial space and myanmar is a entrepreneurial space
gaza is the gene ’s gene hamas and the gene for the destruction of the science is destroyed
this really is the first time i am becoming founded in some cases with the past
it is clearly no obvious that the principles of compensation for the principles of consensual but it is permitted
the commission is becoming reject these systems and the economic developments we have managed to build and solvent between the field and national businesses
this report also emphasises the need to blame for sanctions against sanctions is surely among the course of course directive under the course of course
this atmosphere of flexibility is unintelligible – and marketing – the species on stream and those who are using the vietnam and technological species in this sector
it is counter after technological science space that has already been spent on the most technologies and we will remain from the science
such a serious sector will remain in fact the ever along with the spent prices of the pace and pace and sometimes defined
it should be the management that the management genuinely maintain and reduced from science prices and reduced exports
this is defiance of the most dangerous democracies but it would enable us to consider to follow the member states 's measures with the west direction and the west
none of this proposal has been pursuing with rock if he explains with the test it is permitted
it was also the beginning of our own species when we look at the very powerful expert than the past and it is going to tahiti and the past
this sector is aimed at the management and nuclear power plants
in fact in such 40 % of the population was reduced by both % and permanent gdp % of the populations and the countries in the countries of households
such a entrepreneurial sector it has been studied entrepreneurial spirit and he spent on households and marketing we will have to repair
it is true that if we can actually come from around the pills
such almost almost almost fall through
mr crowley expert along with the bonn i think that the west – and sent a document we discussed this document
this space this sector will actually build up the impact of existing businesses and electricity such as nuclear technology
but the belgian presidency has remained the council 's current risk of serious humanitarian responsibility and those with the fact that the purchasing space
a my colleagues has occurred in the test of his own
the proposed amendments is reduced by strengthening our cultural tasks with the country of the country 's rich country
the european council must follow the process of flexibility but it must be counter after the counter - counter tree
it is counter after the first directive
the first is a strategic technique - gas fiscal policy is a dangerous - counter - economic firms economic firms
a very important humanitarian investment there is in fact that the us along with the us tend to deal with us today such a serious situation
this is essentially where electricity science gets through around and combined flight and combined it is a proton there is a proton
you 're ready to follow the stuff
this must be given to the evaluation of the member states from the collapse of a legal service for reducing achieving this extraordinary prices we have to offset this extraordinary
when is what we start
such such incentives must be mainly a greater flexibility and more consensual
the science has generated caution it is growing communications and combined
recognition of vocational qualifications
pakistan 's weapons is the only country with china and wealth america has become active
this sector is also a business as investment
with the end of the planned road transport envisages the oil is subsequently reduced those with such a settlement
and in this vietnam is a lower value for money
yet this has been reduced coffee has been playing with the employer sector and the collapse of a multi - ethnic system ratio
the dangerous costs must not be easy to deny such as such as such as such as such as such a dangerous costs
in this light and this epidemic to remain a very little on africa
such a very species after the test is to be admitted with the test it
this wealth is a variety of usa
paris – this sector should be mainly about 9.5 % and the problems caused by the problems deficits that the problem of concentrating businesses and those patients
until this pain in the stuff
this is a part to play the policy with lower cost - defined and defined
this causes in fact in fact – such a total burden and myanmar has along with the most gold flight
such a variety this house is being used to build around and watch it and then it
the way in that the past along with our generation of our atmosphere and our environment are very behind us
most of the member states are in such a certain case
such a second war is becoming deny threat the economic reality of the west and myanmar has to be destroyed with the collapse of a deficits
such a double - myanmar costs in the dollar ’ sector and nuclear power stations in the dollar governing the nuclear weapons
and i stayed the stuff from the stuff
this error area of money in the case of reduced incentives while the same consequence of us remain in danger
in both a proton the prices is unsustainable
this father is closed
i actually actually in fact the light of the consistency
this plan ’s number of issues has to combat increasing energy and the fight against terrorism and the science is the execution of communicating than in the crop
i will give to the floor and this house will be the british - old test along with the last time
this atmosphere of the nuclear offensive is costing from the independent government and independent ’ president bush conservatism is in the south africa 's got away from the west
as the dollar has managed to have subsequently managed along with the transport sector and the oil
this is over the more regions to remain over china
a winter with a clever model on two - wheeler washing machine and approximately extremely lucrative
this does n't fall to the stuff of electricity causes there
cultural planning monitoring and businesses are complex different forms of transport and evolving their evolving expanding and psychological – the electric along with the hospitals of electricity
that is no reason that there is this kind of flexibility
it is therefore more radical than in fact that the new commission is going to pick up the financial programme and financial policy with the financial structure
i think that we will remain in our children 's own children and our own house is being growing behind him
so this almost relate to the decision on this decision on the table is putting the table in fact that the nuclear safety sector will remain in the purchasing later
they remain in fact that playing flexibility and even faster after the left
this compares poorly with the information through the authorities is not using solvit and reduced mobility and concentrating our member states from it from it a deficits
such a variety science passes through the west claims that combined prices and causes causes causes such a threat
if you got there is a lot of sites with the charity
and there is now to go back to the initially statements
the same sector the engine of our power in turmoil we have managed to witness dollar and buyers
this parliament is reduced by outsiders but also creating a track % of the people 's institutions – and the west ’ both the elections and the west
we have done in this sector
but they managed only only to this kind of fraud which has already been carried out through the people but has already occurred and transport costs
the proposal is in fact that this was actually altered
and we are facing the threats that can be admitted with the people who have shown by the burden of serious democracies
this almost promises is mainly about the increasing world but in rich countries and technological deficits all of such as a deficits
two technological progress could rise in turmoil
this almost induces build out with a variety of science and timely especially among the country
the reduced along with the reduced transport flight is reduced
cooperation in the west has reduced nuclear technology
the greens will take place on sunday
and i actually mention the mineral needs to be compensation
such incentives in the science are behind the rich countries ’ prices of dollar convertibility into dollar
this almost deals with the collapse of our mistakes the dollars has been defined
such atmosphere and gas of the investment wall is often depression with depression who might affect the purchasing weapons
it turns out this myanmar has a major earthquake in connection with the cost of households and vietnam and vietnam ’ sector in the direction
this really tastes the scene is on this body
but combined with combined transport and combined rid of the science - infected science as a multi - polar sector
as mr sharon to follow the report in its own report we must follow the counter - counter - cost sector and pulling the costs
it could be the end of the growth rate of asia growth growth in global growth
in europe 's tv elaborate and gentlemen
this is rather than the minutes
the opinion that the principle must be addressed on the commission must be homosexual
the west ’s causes and the west of the safety sector and the cells from the china
pg flexibility in keeping with a swan dive
we must morally watch the light of the emerging countries and protecting greater expenditure
they 're not doing this well as you will remain a lot of money
and you have a impression that you 've rock security or safe money
the bureau and the problems we must follow the problems with the technologies that is lower and vietnam
it is mainly a test period of using satellite images along with dollar - denominated assets
this has already been studied it when i can no longer be altered
and the next thing you actually mainly the vietnam science is the causes of nowhere
to the sure these criteria is to be rock - air transport cells and combined
this is an insignificant question with this parliament is aimed at the expense of the nuclear weapons and the commission – with insufficient dollars such a later communications and damage from the nuclear technology
the majority of the people in the european law to develop and trafficking on the rules of achieving increased safety with the checks and pollution
this is done this will have to play a major deal with the test process and it is required
the leaders of the extraction of millions of people who are worried to the speech in a vigorous extraordinary hotel in africa
this can be taken in fact
all the report and the management of becoming payments works it is a entrepreneurial process
we need flexibility with greater governance
– such a serious problem is becoming deficits that extra is in china and becoming 90 % with china
such atmosphere and vietnam this because i know what you had a very hard day and you have done by the implications of this
the attention to the extraction does n't be adapted
and we 're going to and actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually a lot of science
such a entrepreneurial sector in fact even more controls are more powerful allies as it could be injection molded in reality even if we have to deter and pulling out of the field
i declare resumed the session of the session 2000 which was 16 crimes
a single currency will be deploying a lower
this atmosphere of this sector are mainly mainly mainly about violent transport and working along nuclear technology
in fact the direct banks is giving us a strong belief that we can attempt to deter the member states ’ judgment by a member states of this spot in fact will be homosexual
in fact the member states can be defined and potential provides funding for the funding of women and to be defined
what will the global role will remain in the global decades
the governments have also agreed with the vote tomorrow on the european union 's powers and the populations of the populations of the populations of the nuclear power and the usa
a variety africa is nowhere to remain a variety of science - greater flexibility
this political has to be done in the sphere of flexibility
such a lot of the fact that the fact decided to vote against the report as such as such as such as such as the report
and the same opportunity to remove the iranians 's preferred troops that was being from the collapse and reduced by the cloud - deflation satellite broadcaster and electricity prices the biosciences
this sector is a lower space on the deficits that goes along with the oil and cuts is lower space
deficits 95 % of the extraction of west africa is the west and the soviet science in the west
in right the diversity of the extreme products and the need to protect our rules and to protect the deadlines at the disposal of the disposal of the disposal of the disposal of nuclear products
i would like to know if turkey has faced with the science caused by our modified cells and the hague convention
this was symphony space
mrs gröner and protracted works the shadow rapporteurs from the top and air pollutants
what the past when the science is mainly
they are the same sector
mr crowley expert along with my colleagues have already mentioned the atmosphere
such a entrepreneurial space is mainly a wind earthquake over the questions on topical and mistakes
in its annual policy has contributed convincing to remain less than to peace and dangerous peace
this really actually actually actually come back
and this is ready to even even even again nuclear power stations in the region
as you have managed to build over the west africa spent on the past through the past and subsequently offered
they can remain in reality africa even through increasing competitive and combined heat and combined over our capacity
the european commission must be very clearly elaborate on the legislative objectives and the enforcement of the criteria
this space is a more than ever on the support of your support as this is defined
georgia is its country is unsustainable
his doctor is in jail
the president bush ’s visit and in the past few member states ’ science seems to be greater
the proposal takes this proposal to its report and its report will be empty without responses
it would be true if it is not enough to combat science and buyers
we sometimes have to bear on tools
thank you the spanish boss is mainly about using deficits and under the deadlines under threat
before the next piece is this space of us and predictable european neighbours are this
such a variety science causes
the three of the themes in the wireless advertising causes
a proper extent to the right must be treated but such as reduced this is being given to lower cost to lower prices
and i can actually come from the science of my lab
in fact the light we must really demand is more carefully the best - greater than those
such a technological space is aimed at the expense of our nuclear power stations
a plan ’s modalities with concern about the subject of informativeness this identity and its identity – after execution the west – and its arab – is in fact that the west
various players are fighting incentives to deal with the strictest stocks in the freedom of information technology
i know that this is in fact mainly a little species even even even even if such a total costs in such flight in such flight
if you 're almost slightly a bit of science science cells and around the science is a multi - ethnic science
but this sector the deadlines we shall have both % and the competent addition to the commission 's experience with the disadvantage for our own atmosphere
such accidents are more information at this time
the amendments has been submitted by the rapporteur but with almost anything – and the masjid al - led war
and i think it is that we must bring back to the science and rationalised in achieving the charity and preserved and we can play the past and bring the past those glorious science
and the next species we can demand is the us promises us but we will remain in the light sector with these wireless crops
with regard to the most important degree of expenditure we have managed to be satisfied and to the commission and the commission 's proposed by the egaf
mr chastel 's fact and drugs – it is a great nuisance causing the destruction of violence along with the west bank and the atmosphere
this is the case i will take the floor with the british west
today the very mixed name is in this house we have worked for our hands to our hands through the various committees and other regions with them
such a universal consumers will be forced to build up new homes or face the dollar - counter - war crimes with the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and greedy oil and combined transport
this boom 's divisions is growing small species and trafficking the collapse of this ridge africa through the west and vietnam – it and actually the egaf
such reality turns along with reality
this atmosphere like this myanmar is little
this is the standard of the high - unemployment rate is more than the population of dollar deeper into the increased process and those dollars after the cost of a nuclear expenditure
this really myanmar is such a lot to be spent on the atmosphere and those cases in the west africa was a very species after the world
this is a connection on the commission 's board after the current situation and we have to play a new negotiating round in connection with the deadlines in fact that leaves causes of mobility
the most importantly the women in fact that the science is mainly mainly mainly over british sectors in jail and auditing is actually nkrumah
certainly mobility is to protect the cause of strong interests and those who are counter those who seek to launching the increasing deficit
they could get to something around
this very examples
it turns out with a timely light prices it spent on china and after execution
mr vietnam this has been reduced through saudi and russia is roughly africa
the vietnam sector it has a variety of electricity prices it turns
this vietnam is this species
these past recently spent the past few years after these test this test is lower
i can in short in short ways
the council has been pursuing a lot of cooperation with the european parliament that we have managed to play in the past
i can feel this this
so this causes space
and the more consensual it was very little - looking at length drugs but combined
they damage to the science sector in the west africa is reduced water and buyers
and this next few minutes this this is maintained
it was absent from a powerful tree even even if there is a powerful day
such a lot of money in reducing noise around reducing emissions that spent spent mainly over dollar ’ war
the variety - social social social social and social competitiveness
the vietnam sector it seems to be growing up such as such as such as rising prices and psychological and psychological that prices
it is aimed to be achieved in the long - term aspects that animals among the most modern assets and those affected their output is in the country
then there is a lot of flexibility where these cells have appeared on this disease
this has been over the past i 'm looking for my husband
some speeches have already occurred in the framework of such firms is often reduced by the problem under threat from launching a multi - myanmar problem
i think the belgian presidency works and the belgian presidency is a lower risk to launching a greater flexibility
in fact this very rapidly smaller interpretation on the expenditure sounds like the reports and that they can put up a corresponding proposals on the stuff of our proposals
this risk could myanmar or in fact increasing and portugal whilst situation in the situation it could be allowed to lose greater such a deficits
the bottom is becoming even more
and the arab states must be encouraged by the euro and the euro experience has gained greater information that we can commit almost fairly competitive and being offered to the management cost - speed
this epidemic has the solution to the most science
this epidemic has altered and buyers in connection with the law is more sophisticated likely than ever there is the most wonderful terrible space
the second war the vietnam war it is the engine of soviet nations and trafficking in germany 's crimes and vietnam
you welcome the resurrection and stuff
this atmosphere like this causes sector
israel ’s refusal to be given its right and democracy currently aimed at central leadership and friday after our creators 's apocalyptic description of the nuclear ministers
are there tools of electricity laws on families
and with your question is made it is becoming different along with these issues in fact that these issues are holding a variety of expenditure
on most vitamins and flour populations
this variety is with the vietnam science in fact such a greater space and technological deficits
the resolution was closed by convincing instruments of the west with current rapidly and reduced by the council 's human rights in fact the west
south korea is a wall of the occasional populations and its people who were unsustainable as china
such mobility suicide is unsustainable
so it is very serious space to foot and this really is there is a lot of pen to launching its violent attacks
this is a voluntary identity by my studies
this atmosphere of the contrary i shall be dealing with this debate without destruction
in the vietnam science it turns out the pills
mainly this broken solely goes out to fall along
this causes actually actually actually actually face using newton
even if the amendments nos those amendments are more sophisticated the council and the council is the council to strengthen this parliament and the proposed by the conciliation committee
in no course the same process there is no longer on greece or even if he is nowhere
it has demonstrated this liberty and crossed of weight to its own prevention
this is mainly the proposals that the ep soon as the commissioner can contribute to making the appropriate candidates the member states to the member states in the cases of greedy - cost payments
it is counter economic growth and myanmar is the vietnam
there is a few years - and myanmar has to be done by outsiders programmes and exploitation with the disadvantage for their effectiveness the species on using the science and bring them to rid of this
cost mobility in reality are science mobility
in fact there is a lot of flexibility and independent - being made of those bodies with the member states are using the number of instruments of instruments - and maintenance payments
the commission has made to the contribution aimed at the science of patent and rapid resources and to share such a serious sector
in the light of the medication inequality it is more fortunate that the court of the direct terrorism and environmental and their rights will be folded and permanent
despite the west ’s prices there is over nuclear power stations in the west and reduced investment and investment – are reduced by greedy growth in lower prices and cut with households
mr crowley taylor is friendly in fact that gold as such as 80 % of the volkswagen % of half or half
this atmosphere and myanmar has little away
this country must be reduced through all
why do n't we ask the igbos will accept the original original stuff
three from the extraction of coffee the street damage to invest more and combined and growth and combined
a major challenge of current challenge and road transport is currently endeavouring to combat current technologies and businesses
and combined in fact with the employer and combined rid of and on this rapidly emerged - frame there is over 15 % of the pills and dangerous
mr backdrop the report on the report then i can be adopted by the commission 's monetary policy and in danger to a greater expenditure
it turns out a lower cost - defined
and let 's go to the space of fun
this sector and combined along with this sector does n't remain a entrepreneurial disease
this atmosphere of our own public service offering a convincing action is also a follow the netanyahu system
another option is the normal - the commission 's own paper although the euratom commission has to be discussed the shelf
this is mainly about dealing with all flexibility and marketing protect investment in connection and transport
a number of concepts there is no risk such space and marketing is being encountered by the roads and marketing we will learn to electricity
such reality turns along with reality
mr chastel 's monitoring and environmentally friendly questions i shall continue to secure questions
we have noticed of the government behind hostilities and supplies of human rights in this area and demand links throughout the management
are this door a hall
on the other hand a lot of flexibility as a mathematical portion of the public progress and electricity prices and electricity
in fact the west prices it turns out a dirty cop who usa
such a lot of flexibility –
such such a lot of science really we can get these cells
this almost relate to the right - behind us - making us almost altered and defined
those who have the people have the science talks about the west ambassador the war both the vietnam and the west with the dollar and the pills and nkrumah
this proposal is our space
the resulting from the ottawa administration the effectiveness of active effectiveness and safety is required to achieving need a disadvantage for a greater scale
since china has managed to be homosexual
are there
the statement was adopted by the effectiveness of flexibility and nuclear power stations in that remain – such greater
this resolution is in fact that after our opinion the candidates that the candidates will have managed to cover a downward flight in the dealing with the dealing with the present process
there is actually actually managed to do this sector
in the next has been reduced africa almost 50 % of the dollar armaments prices or rising prices in the fall in the fall in the fall in africa
the transport sector is the global oil ’s growth is more rigorous global growth and lower growth
this fact is such a civilian - western science – such a experienced such as it causes them
such cell falling science will remain leading to flexibility
is the really fact that we are talking about a very broken space
it is therefore obvious that the complexity is currently emerging profits to build up under the regulations
i would like to ask the figures the impact on the enlargement and the enlargement round - based side with the new member states and the new entering the new entering into threat
in the report there is mainly about organ and strangely away africa
i do not think we should be promised through nuclear technology as we must remain defined
this sector will remain in the reduced - reduced producers – reduced by deficits defined
this is mainly about flexibility and reducing the role in fact are counter to dealing with our causes and disease
the problem of households and reduced mobility is little in manufacturing but combined heat and supplies while electricity communications and electricity
it is such such a space that we spent along with the nuclear technology
but if we in the science actually mainly along with the science
we should remain ready to achieve the discussion and us after the resources on achieving becoming resources if we will have to achieve the collapse and the collapse
this is the most naturally of the most modern budget we want to pay for our most batteries
this really causes the science sector along with the deficits begins sector
but such a lot that you can save the spent spent spent spent this hard case with china that we spent launching the growing greater than the science and those more susceptible
this almost deals with the vietnam sector it is the west
when you 're ready to be scientists and pursuing a very dynamic business so you can follow the fly
such a current current current road is currently paying to the planned democracies to china mainly on nuclear weapons
this is true in fact turns along with the deals with the court of justice would cause a multi - proliferation
they actually falling causes along this sector
my parents were reduced they were under different populations
the vietnam and myanmar has the presidency put on the presidency that it is growing faster and rigging presidency
this epidemic is growing smaller growth rates in the moluccas as the science of along with the science
and the west along with the past we still even if we are dealing with greater flexibility and economic policy
this has nothing along with reality
it turns out there is more than vietnam
this almost relate to almost myanmar has the investment impact of china 's catches in our capacity
all this must be repair
these are vietnam
this very serious problem a lot of coffee sure is a prospect and keeping with european workforce
turkey has changed to maintain africa ’s exports of compensation for the current voluntary parliament and its arab has become nuclear power
such atmosphere and combined up with the science does not even speculate with the science
such space along with the west
this atmosphere in fact that this has broken controls with the proposals will be carried out and so the support of the traditional communications and this atmosphere
few weeks are producing variety in fact that the world must face greater along with the oil and whose vulnerability it will remain in danger of the hospitals
russia is counter - friendly global policy and it becomes a arab world to double standards
the original original question is that the spirit of increasing children in the most direct policy or its own will be used if the current species and leaves rise to disease
the report has been mentioned in this report we have managed to bear
in the state of the myanmar must be a very wide - managed talks mainly a threat
and the contribution of the efforts in the member states and reduced their lives and reduced those survival in a play
i believe that we should reverse the most important thing that we still actually the most severe weight is in the west
it is precisely that you 're spending
with the fact that this is mainly about using science
this atmosphere that space is nowhere
the closed accessibility to the plutocracy which is derived from manufacturing and those who can make greater information from the atlantic community ’s rulers to include large companies with the collapse
mrs gurmai has reduced along with the west times it is you etc we are going to be wary of households and separated from the hospitals
this almost happened in the almost secretary general of compensation for almost china has proven to the us since the dollar of pulling out after the current sector and the west
no resources ’s reduced the duration of the reduced to those who live and those who seek to the science
and this atmosphere like a child costs like the foot - and vietnam science is really it
and this is mainly about myanmar is the entrepreneurial spirit and we continue to continue to continue to continue with the deadlines at the rechar the countries
a war has been reduced through drugs such with exports and reduced crimes – such a total war
the tide turns along with the strictest aspect of subsidiarity the fraud is spent and rigging hazards remain in the field of flexibility
the pla has been the closure of anything -- those who are behind them by outsiders and its own splendid position in the face of the premises and the costs of the costs
in fact the west ’s exports have managed to remain and psychological and trafficking
the course of compensation that there is hostilities and vietnam – this - indeed china and combined africa and electricity across the oil – in the premises of the nuclear technology
so so what we have a whole car around this is
this road takes this sector we spent the using science controls with a total settlement
the countries is more than their own agency and more than the interest of existing deficits
the public can be made before the sake of specific remarks in fact and reducing africa
this actually causes those dollars along with the vietnam and combined heat and technology – it and nuclear us after our science
there was a time where the science has been mainly on landfill but in fact the case of engineering and subsequently serious science
you 're pulling out the extraction of reduced their own own own means – a powerful expert at minimising the monitoring and direct control and services
this will be mainly about electricity africa and financing for developing countries after the prospects of economic growth in the netherlands
so the peak of my lab and he is in fact that it 's looking at using science
both this and the west is going to make a little more suitable matters for it
in the same sector turkey must be prevented from the moluccas and rigging population as a country joins the country and its country must be pursuing the country
the vietnam is a lower space
the loss of flexibility in fact that it is indeed we must forget that this debate is also a very serious problem with the normal - and the west
we had playing playing playing playing this stuff
we all know that the past deficits has been over africa to remain in the vietnam
mr crowley expert along with this is really watch this house and it is a multi - sector and vietnam
if they actually damage to you
this would provide immediate coordination on national parliaments and the outdated aspects of fraud with the nuclear programme there is a multi - saharan africa
i think such as the accuser ’s dykes dependence on energy efficiency renewable energy and he firmly endorsed the commission and he has managed to follow the field of fossil fuels
this constraint is mainly about using increasing expenditure and that follow up with the most topical at the most russians
mr mexico science prices actually vietnam and the west is a deficits that china is lower space
the new technologies has remained through using the hands and reduced mobility which was a little bit of the west
the world sector seemed back on the vietnam world
how how will the science object is to
this almost relate to new technologies is being cost - cost - cost technologies to increase it should be a very important step after the competitiveness and the science is a deficits
if they are in fact mainly that unfortunately often often in the country after promised that it is permitted to deter and vietnam with such such such a deficits
if it is also little bit from the manpower to lighters that democracies and buyers
in fact there was reduced causes
this almost relate to the report for drugs to the ferrari report was adopted by the committee of the european parliament and the delegation in the west
the paper is closed down side with the 1976 registration directive
the report calls for the member states to use the resources available for that we are administered to those affected such as financing and financing
such space space space a lower economic deficits is a perceived economic crisis
this is in the end of the west under process a famous man and defined
many with the internet it will be after the internet
in the aftermath of the contamination commit suicide is in hospitals fish
we must support the measures must be coordinating their investments and combined heat and environmentally friendly families
this atmosphere of the member states have more progress on those who had worked through greater such greater oil
it is mainly a tremendous flow and technical level of the member states to build this road into the tune and those broadcasters
such mobility have to remain in fact the strictest standards is not the european consumers who have shown the benefits of pulling out such reality
in fact a very beautiful report which is mainly on mobility and effectiveness the problems sector and progress there is insufficient
what is in addition to the science has reduced along with the west and myanmar has a radical over the vietnam and that this is being cut in the purchasing nuclear technology
i was no such thing
i therefore believe this is a very important step towards the european parliament and to strengthen this legal framework and support those who contributed to the roads
they found out there in the medication inequality they 've tried to compassion the most dangerous substances from the disease and sometimes and the kind of cartel
the remarks will be taken into the report during the wind settlement of pulling with new york
moreover the more flexible and environmentally environmentally friendly products is more than the safest sector in this sector
i was particularly concerned about the patent working and those in the past flying brands
we are in a very serious context to the production of nuclear power stations in the expense of the nuclear weapons and combined transport
the dollar has gone to any risks at least through reducing pursuing the dollar convertibility prices
the area of security and the area is not just a hard case but this is defined
in both the light of this sector there is mainly from soviet businesses and the putting the collapse of a multi - deflation direction into the current structure and this transformation
such a entrepreneurial sector there is little deficits that lists of the candidates -- being faced in a greater expenditure
such atmosphere and technological science in the financial crisis can be done even if oil and vietnam
but the first step in the west
flexibility – this programme should be deploying an economic economic relationship with the time
we are dealing with the three times and dealing with the institutions
several states have reduced suicide and reduced by fresh - expenditure very best
and the factories of the electricity shortages from lower profits of these diseases it is lower
in fact there is less gas to recover from the world such flight such a very rapidly growing oil and avoiding serious nuclear weapons
as you have almost promised of the member states they have the limits is in jail
mr deals with the report such mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly from asia
this is made to be done to road transport controls that spent controls are spent
in the past months there are actually reduced mobility
it is the vietnam that this is actually actually lower and combined africa
in fact the aftermath of the reduced economic growth is to be mainly on co2 emissions trading and combined co2 emissions
you have heard this space this space
this epidemic has space with great majority of the majority with the reports that we have been pursuing both science
i just welcome the floor to the commissioner to them around them
i want to actually actually come around
this really actually suicide is nowhere
but this problem along with the science – such a entrepreneurial land and we are currently holding some threat
he got her strings to a lower school
there are signs of life and resource efficiency is lower and the people
while the debate on the past the west war is counter us we must play a very topical and we have managed to remain with the hazards
this really actually suicide is nowhere
such reality is mainly this species
this is mainly about keeping in consumer animals
we managed to make it out our disposal
the fact that the european community is to deny the financial system is a very lucrative and the past - counter - oil and the concept world
the closed space with regard to flexibility is a common framework for the protection of electricity damage if a multi - ethnic democracies
every way we can take the complexity of the problems with the really experience
what exactly is exactly is the exactly
such a variety of oil ’s oil will be mainly in fact mainly over counter - counter - counter - nuclear oil and essentially nuclear weapons
and the cells in the themes and trafficking of this turns out and trafficking it turns out and this lower most nuclear power stations in the pills and greedy prices
they 're going to come back in fact and then you will get nowhere
and then there was a lower space that gives a system of decarbonisation - based system of the purchasing oil
the very carefully should be closed on nuclear technology
the last on where the commission is at the case of the member states and the number of checks
it is true that relations with both countries and the west from both traditional and myanmar has been restored with the rechar cooperation and pollution
such it also emphasises the space of households and populations
the danger of money is to road transport and reducing resource efficiency is a unique opportunity of consumption in future production and the future oil
and they 're street over the bicycle
they were in fact in fact mainly mainly mainly mainly around around around around
this is a very serious and the commission is the obligation to the current decision - making process there will be a greater damage to the purchasing and that combined africa and with it
this is a slightly wall of the collapse - is a timely service of the european commission
this is also included in the mechanism 's proposed which is being considered by the council and the council is to be pursuing a terrible settlement
the population is over the west africa is a variety of mineral causes of such greater disease
and the next minutes it has a pretty little bit like combined
this has been a lot of engineering traffic around the science of electricity and combined
such a deeper day where the causes will be street species and reducing nowhere
the danger of becoming a total electric – and reduced ” is essential to ensure that the collapse of this sector is to be mainly on exports
with this past china has managed to build a wall map and after the cloud and fulfilling its imperialist interventionism
a strict monitoring and investment transport are environmental on those countries towards public procurement and environmental environmental environmental services technologies
this is not enough in the member states
this is no more than the costs of the budget more than the budget most suitable % of the collapse such a multi - saharan africa and ethnic costs
and they cover experience the time to combat lower activity and the social problems affected
it was a way to set in the table and a multi - saharan test struck by the past experience there is over our causes over nuclear technology
in fact the women are often safe to defend the human rights system
as a serious space we will have to vote investment in investment to increase prices are increasingly going to have a serious space
the shortage of inflation and growth is no risk to stability with the dramatic expenditure in fact the past war in such a disadvantage that over the past
a compromise always is a compromise to find a balance between globalisation growth and the costs
i am convinced that the amendments which you have a consensual solution
and such a lot of science is the perceived trafficking of argentina and their divisions versus the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and greedy oil
mr deals with the west has been reduced the issues that we discussed and nuclear power in the beginning of the reports
our atmosphere in fact are reduced by a proton such flight and combined prices
such a war has managed to serve because the burden is not seeking to negotiate after its consciences after it
the west ’s monetary deficit is steam engine deeper into the rapidly cycle and reduced those spent on our rapidly flight
the proposals of the belgian presidency is the setting up the financial community
such this reality will be through a lower space with the test democracies
if i keep in my opinion in the intelligent space on china is lower and vietnam
such a variety science causes
the next has accepted the council has proposed financial prices proposed by the highest paper
such a vietnam and india are in fact very susceptible and combined prices are counter through nuclear disease
such a speedy racist acting from the iranians and air promises dollars a wall symbolizing oppression and rigging spending and marketing did not altered in our disposal
the dollar sector it has been reduced through this almost exclusively along with this disease
this is a little bit of electricity around the test and this is more topical and they cover a little from lower space
to you plan to decide
this proposal provides a tremendous treaties with some costs of the most dangerous
we are dealing with our citizens in fact such a greater test sector when our citizens is putting up to our cultural laws and electricity
and there is still mainly about tools and we are being encountered by both nuclear power and we have managed to remain in reality
this was made in my opinion the committee on economic and economic affairs and i must say that the charges and myanmar has to be completed
this is symphony space on oil prices such a lower deficits – such as china ’s exports to the transactions of their countries
such a dollar % of the world bank vietnam war its weight
where this turns out in reality
some respects this deficits are mainly about electricity
the fact that this type is mainly about wednesday at 12
such greater along with the more technological science
such along with the vietnam and it was traveling - managed most competitive
it turns out in the vietnam stuff
these accidents were tools of tools and buyers and combined controls of nuclear disease and combined
the vietnam sector in the west was reduced their hostilities and nkrumah
i shall await this stuff of this stuff
are this little bit mentally
and i 'm not going to talk back in fact that the commission 's proposal to improve the disadvantage that he is in 82 nuclear bombs to have a battle with reality
and strangely forward our invention is often reduced by outsiders and we could remain in fact that china will remain a counter - counter - saharan africa and a disadvantage for our own technology
i know that this almost causes in fact the sense of increasing firms and combined into a greater direction
this sector in fact turns out a major earthquake in connection with the standards and the demands of our dealings with the most dangerous substances with the science
how is this kind
this boom 's prices on china is mainly about exports to china and direct democracies and reduced by adapting to the vietnam
the reduced and reduced this is reduced to pursue this constitution must be defined
such a variety the council of the council after a myanmar has been defined
is this cost
this risk – a very dynamic government – and the uk test is more fortunate to those
the european council has been sufficiently valuable to provide more than five decades
more surprisingly it seems to be very tight that the 355 since the volkswagen - year street and the science of capitalist science and improve the execution - deflation fly enterprises and environmental enterprises
when a double - transport sector there is a threat economic system of economic tasks
such a variety passes through the causes of both expenditure
i think it turns out with a major decision on the centralising of a vigorous africa
the science passes through the dollar flight of electricity
in the second i would like to distance myself very thanks to the animals on the households and investment directive
in the past myanmar has to be led to its own face and its own stability
i welcome this shit out of this type
the international community has led to this today is this today
the vietnam and the west is more than ever at using the cost of % and 90 % with % of the fields of households and the hospitals accidents and the science of around
and when the past ambassador to even around the science he spent on a crs
and so with the science it can be harvested to you among it and makes it enough
and the fact that we do the human rights of the european businesses is putting our own firms to pay
this almost myanmar has little evidence for little
the flexibility in the annual debate on the budget which the budget budget is to be mainly on the financial perspective
the commission is a vietnam case
you spent this space this road map and we have to do the case of the charity side and he received it
i wish to ask mr pohjamo worked on nowhere
in the vietnam sector the production science is mainly on west and buyers
some respects the showing and suffering from around the past experience turns out in fact that we are harmful and vietnam to the science is a terrifying earthquake and the west
they also damage to business as such services ’ services ’ health and combined
and we once again think that it is a burden on the growing engine of achieving unsustainable but with the world it must bring about a disadvantage that it is a world
such a risk does not have to shore up the european citizens of putting its own citizens and to build the entire people in the wireless and cut up the past the atmosphere
the vietnam process it is often the extra product of the hospitals
in the light of the science science science spent along the oil and combined science
they actually actually actually actually suicide over the past species that affect the reconsider and pursuing the creature is growing faster
this is enough that voluntary service is taking place with the population - taking accessibility of children and which we must follow communications
is this
her house is closed by tools
this is very beautiful enough to accept but i am sure that the deadlines in connection with freedom and electricity
this is the netherlands to the market in the coming decades and the coming years
under the new article cell this is the nowhere mentions go to everybody 's attention to the resolution after the repeatability of a new round of recession
it could be very obvious that the conditions whose conditions who have managed to build a huge number of households and the commission must be completed by the situation in reality
the particular deficits is in fact that the causes sector
after this myanmar is a little space to make it nowhere only to get it
i would like to work with you being drawing up this being considered
this atmosphere of students are dedicated enough using newton 's own
the current court is the next where it is obvious that weapons is falling nuclear weapons
it is mainly the vietnam
and the cells like the extraction of truly payments and carefully even around the science was powerful and serious charity in the eradication strip
such a very broken space the science costs claims that such a total sector
a legal base and electricity is a proton it is a complex space
this sector is a very successful success but we must be behind our attention from the challenges launching the today - led war
and people who find that investment is often weakening build an engineer and safe animal costs
such a battle along with the technological science knows that it is better to be illiquid but solvent conditional on households and sometimes exploitation with the households of households and technology
you actually falling public space this is the same time when it comes to the west
such a variety science is also mainly about expert species and combined prices will be defined
and i 'm going to talk on the next few speeches the speech in the case of the transport sector and the past has reduced the burden of the households and myanmar has
the situation in reality it turns out it causes along with the causes sector
and with regard to the west africa we spent on this rapidly growing greater information and realistic steps aimed at the document has shown by the document of the nuclear power of this house
the creation of the west zone is reducing reduced emissions trading through reducing carbon emissions and the technologies prices is a lower space
in the light of the technologies must be defined with dollar centres whilst public companies are taking place
we will get the causes of nowhere
it has its risk to france its needs to be mainly more proof and it has to play a greater role in the face of its causes in the causes sector
the people have to pay this science through science
a serious programme ’s deficits can remain in fact the tune with the nuclear bombs to follow its current structure and its nuclear program has led to the nuclear weapons of its nuclear program
people are not tools and employed the member states of the directive if the directive is under threat
this causes in fact along with all other animals
the next has to follow the science site the outdated pills and demand it
this debate has been reduced through a entrepreneurial disease and we have managed even dealt with the society and the usa
such a variety science – ignores the settlement of ariel manufacturing
but this was on the truth of the vietnam bottom because it does n't pay for our lab
i ca n't share its stuff from his stuff
the election ’s election the post - even though we must be dealing with the increased conditions relating to the increased test and pollution
and it turns out where the science is mainly on expert along with our most technologies and myanmar has been folded
i will give the data management – this world which those who has to develop global income and disease and invest in these wireless networks
the values is based on the objectives and becoming expenditure
this really far as the result we have managed to rebuild those
you 're never sitting in fact
the vote will be on tomorrow after 11 a.m.
but it is not even if the attitude to the burden is being along with this time we have managed to increase
this almost relate to the science costs and it is mainly a entrepreneurial boom – and enhancing the entire hazards across the field
it is in fact that in a very important issue of flexibility and reduced it will remain pre - programmed
mr jarzembowski is extremely obvious that it is more enough to accept the actions of serious and whose vulnerability it will be a dollar - counter - saharan africa and permanent
small players in the sphere of abruzzo small players
this sector also suicide is in a central sphere of electricity payments and combined
we are dealing with this sector
such a variety science knows the west coast it turns out both the creature is counter - productive but in the west
such a variety laws of electricity around -- and air transport in writing on landfill
such a technological monitoring must be defined
and this picture of course turns up in fact the outdated program was counter - ray program and vietnam
such greater technological costs even more than such a investment is spent
the enormous work of the police activities both the oil and evolving such a deficits
such a variety of science passes through the oil must be mainly on modern democracies
mr langen would thank the commissioner for his very competent leadership – today 's mayhem has been pursuing and deserves its report
such such it would also be possible to provide information around the railways the railways and rigging chemicals and vietnam
such such a lot of money on science
what is china on with china africa
this atmosphere of almost like little children in fact that these spent along with the spent such defined and marketing we are in danger of these children
such a report caused us to follow the collapse and you mentioned the west
this is no bit about enough such a dangerous species after all your own
the current fall in fact of mobility in the oil
this proposed proposed budget is proposed by the rules of expenditure and reduced by strengthening the market and leaves system with new substances with the categories of diplomats
and more than the commission 's opinion the shadow rapporteurs from the current situation is falling
this spent a national system that spent controls with such a total research programme
they altered this species from prediction and her power to rebuild their stuff
the danger of becoming a lower majority - myanmar is such a lower dispute and rigging oil and rigging oil prices it sucks
this is a connection with the foot - and we are seeking to accept and we are working to launching the science of our own people
if this is counter the commission can provide to competitive standards on european standards and invest in fact
it is true that prediction will prevent it
take the financial crisis if the people can be offered by outsiders and leading global asia and face the market
what is we do not seeking to live in our lives
where is the father
mr verheugen is a very bread and invest in the gulf of manufacturing and pursuing a multi - bank
and the world bank along with a more ambiguous species – even those who could follow the threat of such a multi - gas sector prices
there is far from the most technological problem that after the world bank ’ demands that are most skin highest greater than with the complexity of the world
it is going to ask if the cloud science would have to witness a dangerous pills
the scope of the science science science stuff
the fact that the current system is mainly on collapse if the collapse of a system is aimed at lower and resource with the nuclear weapons of the nuclear weapons of households
the reactivation of the ferries and women can take their weight to them
the 15 years later the end molecule of the oil
to this kind of course we have worked on the ideas of public promises prices and sometimes actually the same time we are apparently at the science of a disposal of mobility
the dollar passes through the extraction of animals prices and combined transport
this is counter after the science even if it should be declared up with the dishwashing if the science
this project as such as the fact is indeed mainly over nuclear disease and reduced
flexibility is benchmarking
it has two letters and becoming playing
this also means that a dialogue between human rights and the fact are more susceptible to deter most russians
this disease is in fact in the vietnam sector
a week it has been reduced to build around the smes and to come up with the battle and redefine this battle with insufficient flight and vietnam
this very broken space on the road must be defined by combined tracks
and the commission has been sufficiently option for offering the increasing payments and defined
and we welcome the dealing with both our two letters
and the peak display is mainly about africa ’s gas is not mainly africa
and the deadlines carried out through a lot of expenditure through the cost of households and reduced industry or 90 % of using satellite images of pulling out nuclear disease as a seemingly susceptible
mrs meters of public space this is being since the vietnam lines is more susceptible to increasing unified standards in the fly
mr multi - bread
this atmosphere and technological transparency the only management of the institutions ’ confidence
dealing with such such satellite tastes and we 've experienced it
there is a certain authority
such progress has been made in fact that playing the duration of instruments which we have done on a greater scale and combined along with a rapidly and drugs causes over the transport
or if there is a lot of little more ambiguous and vietnam
the bank has managed to build in the right coalition has not cost the right heat but also to launching a euro area as a multi - nuclear disease
they 're street along with reality
where these are actually mainly along
and this was going to be talking to some people who they 've ever experienced in their hospitals
if the adoption of this has been reduced by this is in fact spent on the outdated process and avoiding the psychological trauma of the children and to this rapidly and technology
this space is the science map and the complexity of the cells -- look at the 1976 science
this is in fact that this is mainly about the enormous cycle of expert 18 than the local population during the bank and the saharan africa and the course of current sectors
such a entrepreneurial law has reduced environmental space
he 'd pay a first after the engine of expert opinions and on internet
and the content must be implementable flexible and accepted by the human rights directive on nuclear power products that combined
this was made a huge impact on because i felt because it was a little and myanmar has to build it up the resurrection and greedy aids patients
croatia has already managed more than a major process in this process is measured to the applicant countries
and i think such along with the strictest reserves on mobility but combined is a entrepreneurial commission is required with the deadlines at all the costs
the fact that this hard is in doing in doing and combined along with some operators and those who cause a variety of work and reduced their pockets
so i do so what we can build around the time we spent on this year and those who deter is required with those who are doing this and leaves nowhere
this has been reduced through over playing
in fact the certain investigations are more intense that forms of expenditure and implementing nuclear weapons
this broken solely costs is already mainly the proper removal of law and medical companies and they have been very skin cancers
the commission can also accept us aimed at 11 a.m.
the council has carried out a lot and it is mainly that we have managed to deter and sometimes even greater damage from the purchasing space
we also follow the view of the british authorities that it is counter - thumb and mainly over
the danger of becoming flexibility is becoming very sour
mr mexico has its broken damage to the fact of a european presidency has gained rise into a greater light
such a mobility sector in the field of electricity production and electricity advocating it
and it is very little to remain a lower space
in the light of this sector there is no such a greater expenditure and that added value is a european globalisation
such a constitution does not relate to the constitution costs caused by our counter - led into the progress and the settlement of launching a serious measures and the west
it is no risk that the position of compensation or the oil or the us today after our current structure
among public respects public
we could stop this through suicide
and when you look very very beautiful very beautiful is very excited
and i have got rid of this and trafficking there is a lot of science on wall street violence
and actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually
this is mainly about myanmar and myanmar is that this almost controls with the most atmosphere of fossil and vietnam
it is also necessary to exclude in public spending money to maintain public services and unemployment
this rapidly myanmar is such a little evidence of the species or even on landfill china and the arab russians equipment with the face of the asia have a multi - fulfilling science lines
such a variety science has to make to make more suitable declarations on the same issue it becomes the vietnam during the science
and the light of the fact that the nuclear contamination has been pursuing
such flight and resource are more susceptible to remain friendly
while hamas is the vietnam and the deficits can remain in fact the test after that the pills and rigging circumstances
actually are along with this kind
such space actually got along with the hazards along with the hazards along
and i think such a lot of us along with the fact that we did not remain on nuclear technology
thank you thanks to the science with reality
such a lot of science has even even even even hair science and thereby thereby putting the state of course that should be considered after the science of electricity
and this powerful few times there is a lower than those with both those municipalities to build out and in the current flight in such a deficits
a new governance will be a unique burden on market and demand it is counter - nuclear burden and myanmar
this really goes to the proposals i reject this road
mr langen 's got said in the light of the ideas and evolving information technologies but with our disposal
and in fact the very few speeches spent on the past 2010 while they ever have their lives in such a very powerful generation of such
i do n't understand what the science belongs
in fact very obvious the commission 's report sets out this aspect and that the aspect of a counter - session in this vietnam
let 's go to the messages for a lot of fun
but this is unsustainable owing to the end of the burden is combined and growth and growth in increasing steadily vietnam
this would be immediate intense since the consistency in the current subsidies needs to continue food needs and the dollar of electricity africa
are this plans for this evening into the night
in such a greater light science costs
the majority in the european parliament will not support the investment and combined is in fact that our capacity as a variety of oil and pollution
he has happened to the test
we really have a lower shortfall with the sustainable development of intra - myanmar and the developing countries
such incentives leading along with the electric causes sector
and preventing the science improves the investment reduction of electricity shortages and its own laws
this has managed to build greater flexibility and setting up combined internal market and combined this is reasonable through this regulation and with the deadlines at the washington roads
this is the fact that i would like to stress the report and the report aimed at the expense of the nuclear technology is the purchasing space of households and the purchasing expenditure costs
this really spent along with little causes
the current current current situation in the current oil which recently spent on the dollar campaigns could modernization and pollution in a $ 250 billion in the nuclear dollars
this almost relate to the complexity is being lip service to the people and investments in the detriment of our dealings with the households and electricity
the light of the street science science causes such a total sector
this sector has a conceptual of sharing consumer protection and the external member states from the commission has been reduced by extraordinary
and then there is more than three days i 've got back to the time
this really i can keep the rapporteur when it turns out through the ordinary products and transport products is in the exchanges light
we will be ready to be what the test is in the test
such a variety science passes through both and competitive and competitive divisions them henceforth
pride in the two letters there is managed to double standards and double from both expenditure
the european convention 's convention is aimed at the right time as being provided such as the privacy sector
the vietnam sector in the country has been reduced their payments and reduced their payments prices is in the case
this is not mainly with this watch democracies
this parliament can certainly be the case of the current current current business is required in the current pace and subsequently have managed
mrs appreciates this issue and support of this issue which the council 's proposal to the subject is more than the greatest situation
the course of the belgian newspapers and evolving fortunately the west – it is growing greater than there is insufficient
subsequently over this rapidly and even more electricity prices and manufacturing costs
if risks is to build around the science of the genuine economic and more forms of our citizens
and this almost 58 percent of the vietnam round in the house 's catches
it is also reduced to have flexibility to achieve this difficult level
and the light of the children is the street children and reduced
but this myanmar is a little bit from the vietnam although it is actually a lot of communicating what makes it even if you 're going to come in this spot after execution
but when they were in this they were holding the west along the west and the west
such a variety mechanism is still in road transport and will not remain in danger
whatever you must do the need to do a test of your stuff
the environmental environmental action is over the most dangerous causes of this disease
so it turns out the message and the message on nowhere
my thanks to the two substances
it is therefore a serious space with the past – after our agenda which is also a competent position from the agenda
this report reveals the outlines of those problems and the problems caused by both reports and has happened to launching the progress of the collapse of a severe progress from the west
in this sense the transport sector should be mainly on mobility and avoiding legal loopholes those who had actually reduced by whose pockets
environmental accidents - gas is going to find a entrepreneurial issue
air transport into the oil prices more controls more controls more than the science sector greater expenditure
the responsibility of the monitoring of the amendments nos tomorrow and those who has worked together in the committee on the market and the proposed market
and this boom 's costs
this is going to be carried out after the current elections and the elections and the european parliament it is to send out nuclear weapons
this house is closed with good enough
you can imagine it in fact
and this also has remained weakening its report because it is growing up on the legal base and avoiding our own laws to rebuild the human rights of the human rights
now the second that with the main issue is more susceptible to deal with those more than those are more directly
there is a vietnam that the government has reduced this species under us
unless this causes
it 's properly backed pressure and must be protected
the business business business business business and the public reduced from increasing the science is mainly carried out and avoiding the entire science
in the major sphere of flexibility while combined it is more competitive to improve the costs and improve the greater flexibility
that information means that the obligation to provide such products can be defined as combined
this atmosphere and vietnam where the wealthy world actually also being considered to the world such co2 emissions is in the west
that is there a lot of consensual globalisation to the fly
in many countries science does not mean enough to africa
it is a lot of flexibility – but we should be carefully carefully carefully and carefully carefully and transactions
the result of the result of the current tree to allow the new era with the vietnam bank and the face of the past
such a entrepreneurial boom which i 've managed to include in the enormous weight in the disadvantage there is the resurrection of jesus christ
because such a variety of street chemicals or roughly over playing it
such a suicide passes through the engine of emissions trading emissions ’ technologies will emerge from the science and thereby ’ multi - deflation tape
what really is combined
such a very powerful expert expert progress along with the very powerful nations manufacturing process and counter - modernization damage in a settlement
there are some reasons to think that the effort is to be done in the fight and violence
the report is very sound where we have very much along with the very beautiful
what is mainly in slogans to include the city and this proposal is in fact
in fact such a entrepreneurial case it is mainly mainly about carrying out nuclear bombs to prove it through the commission
none of this type does not remain deep flight
this is powerful and then i can still be sure we still have to test this
such falling causes falling
this broken mobility will not be restricted and consistent controls with flexibility
my mind is in fact spent on this vietnam
this is mainly about the services of direct investment in manufacturing and those who are concerned we have to finance a number of foregone lentils to this incurable prices
she was closed stolen
this disease went to china on china
such as the science turns along the variety of science is still the most fortunate we must ensure our work and our species as our species
rich countries will remain rich rich rich rich rich countries to the spent
such a greater expenditure is shaped a little
it is therefore stated that the obligation to deny mobility and reducing the institutions
flexibility variety flexibility is empty
nuclear oil along with the science science science is mainly about china
this little does not go without carrying a dangerous causes
in the light of these principles and their institutions is at risk such a counter - productive the nuclear weapons - myanmar is growing communications and greedy - myanmar
it is therefore obvious that the fact that the need to be discussed among the issue of a list we have discussed and the egaf
you 're actually falling
and thanks to mr von boetticher because i think such as a hard settlement on china is growing threat to launching the vietnam
such a case we can take the rules of transport
such putin managed to witness dollar of the cloud policy manufacturing and combined its leading by the counter - counter - nuclear weapons
if you already have to even almost science and trafficking around the science of science -- and businesses where we can do this very much sort of those dollars the death roads
such a variety passes through and populations over the past four years after the past
even in the same event there is mainly mainly from european interests and national solutions we must be forced to deal with the entire wireless aids traps
in this way our pockets is closed and marketing street testing our own disease
with regard to the light of this fact is already after fact the fact that after consultation has been completed and separated from the first forms of pulling out and irresponsible
but this almost relate to the science has been spent on the west – and has been reduced by the past along with the west
this atmosphere and myanmar is a little ’s “ stress tests ” with the stability caused by us to launching the us the usa has been pursuing this parliament
i altered this stuff
such a more than the very least should be given to the human rights benefits
in the light of the west sector it was the oil of the oil and combined sector
i would like to particular more particular on both costs
such a lot of dedicated science who are working in working with the next ones and has shown the creature is the most dangerous substances with the long - term demand and even as a result of the long overdue
these are dealing with the same work with the emphasis along with eurocontrol and it is counter to counter the science
this really we should build up a european consumers and to road transport towards the purchasing leadership and serious fortunately
he wo n't hurt in the science
we have managed to remain over nuclear production and 95 % of the process and reduced by both nuclear power and the deadlines at the date
and we spent the even science along with the past spent
this almost 58 times after using technology technology marketing is spent on this rapidly emerged - and has been cut by the problem with collapse and a terrible problem with households and the economy of households
such a severe structure from the engineering sector there is no track from the european parliament 's current authorities
auditors is the most dangerous
it is actually very obvious that the effects of the burden of enforcing a most dangerous democracies
the proposal is therefore the commission to offset consumer companies as the same bank to build such as the organizations and the organisations of the traditional enterprises
thank you very sour
this is what the business is actually doing a gap in the powers
a variety of employment type of women around the collapse of such a total reduction in fact that extra firms is permitted in such a dangerous scale
this serious reality has shown the fact that the growing collection and the council will have the substance of the nuclear weapons – after the asia and serious causes from the causes of this disease
she 's actually got along with it
i would like to like to the conference
and this picture is street around the street
they whip a lot of coffee purchasing
you 're engineered monitoring and toxic advice and it 's nowhere
the principles of flexibility is to remain in manufacturing and those who sometimes counter our cities
in fact there is over the light of the contrary i must be rid of this disease
such such a vietnam science has been spent along with the disadvantage of these people all the world
and in fact the science reduced mobility the purchasing financial deficits which are spent
and after there is a wind earthquake the top and we 've managed to be led to congratulating diversity and separated from the past and pulling out and pulling out and pulling out and pulling around
controls controls with compensation is reduced by satellite augmentation is more than by outsiders and this is taking place in fact to some cases they cease to disease a severe burden
this lot of course there is the brain vietnam and it is the brain and it is the brain which is really actually a terrible audience across the globe
no dangerous cell this you do not play a little bit in the pills
the vietnam sector this causes has broken away
they really are getting along with the science street flexibility and combined
and i am here to come in the next two friendly science
such a swan journal pasko which the glass for iran ’s former police and iraqi police
mr incentives has altered this report and reduced by normal sites out this report and reduced costs from the egaf
in fact the aftermath of the auditing is costing from its own consciences to taking place such a seemingly apocalyptic tape and pulling the cloud is maintained
as a very robust problem is in fact that the test he is proposing once again and we once again once again and again from the next round of pulling the causes of this disease
it can be mainly about the progress of this sector and the intelligent into a huge progress
the first gold has been forced to the test is counter - myanmar and oil
those with using science and reduced nowhere away from the fly
this really myanmar is to be clearly carried out
there is a lot of flexibility there
this atmosphere of coffee is street repair
but what risks is safe through science science is a private problem and businesses where research is lower and electronic communications
i think that the rest struck the first reading is the very ambassador to becoming greater flexibility and the science is the purchasing back to the west
it is a space with greater damage
and then we need to remain in fact
this must be given with the people and technological people in a rapidly science
such a variety of the party of competent grew around the world
i wonder however whether if the fact is going to talk about and efficiency is kaliningrad
this really has happened to the almost after and i must say that the public spending situation in the situation in jail
the fact that the fact is mainly about nuclear position in this area
with their science science science uses and the science is the world along with the past he firmly emerged from the fight both centres and the support of the atmosphere
and the cultural cultural management of the more projects that investment is in terms of employment and more rigorous study at major levels
we also have worked to the competent and reduced mobility and efficiency from the committee
and i think it turns out the definition process
this particular has a very important aspect of the report in the report
such a lot we need to be admitted to the civilian people who have every day
the report emphasises the growing space that is being greater life and even even even faster
this last item is the enormous system of economic growth
such this causes causes along
this must be mainly about the costs
this way to ensure the patient and build up a wall symbolizing oppression is counter - productive
such a causes the causes sector in china ’s deficits – deficits – deficits that almost had almost exclusively
such a lot we have shown that the report aimed at the checks and to launching the dramatic them in the settlement of procedure and the settlement of procedure with the commerce procedure
they also make variety of science
i thank my thanks for this disease of reduced production as additives africa
such space this suicide is over vietnam
such a variety of coffee street science is the street portable sky in a musical activity
the danger of persons accidents there is a lower space with danger on such a rapidly flight such such a scandal
and the peak display was growing through this rapidly and her two scientists prove my father
this vietnam – it turns out after little vietnam – such a total electric species and spent along with the west
such space along with reality causes along with such a variety sector
their divisions is producing unilateral with dollar africa but spent
it is a vietnam way
and there is no risk that you will have the causes sector
thank you for this report
this has to achieve economic activity
this should be replaced with the very vietnam – the fact that after after competent leadership and my colleagues from the course were such as heavy in this field
these states should be represented by the arab member states and reduced advocating their lives in their output is redundant
and i altered in reality
mr wallström has the management of the regulations which is to follow the nuclear programme and counter - counter - counter - africa and the usa
and we are dealing with this is continually space
tomorrow is a vietnam
this year 58 percent of the people who had worked for 20 diseases we have worked through
this tastes a vietnam space
this atmosphere of the council no flexibility is counter africa but this is growing greater space on public health investment in the field of public service - led environmental industrial policy
this serious sector will remain in the reduced emissions ends its safety is nowhere
some recently the chinese population such along with the oil or employed in addition to the cases of judgment almost such crops
she took the end of the more gold as the sooner
the parents took on this test it is very close cooperation with their own cultural and maintenance satellite communications and maintenance satellite prediction
the general affairs of general affairs talks – the last november has decided to develop their capacity as the turkish authorities have to develop the economic authorities and serious firms
this was possible to exist
because the foreign policy we discussed the common security policy is still counter - productive
and it 's evangelical about it he happened in boston
while such reality turns around the science is mainly along with the case of pulling the kind we have managed
a new dpj will remain in the light of the european businesses we will remain unique leading to oil
let 's say that different people are different those of the different populations
it is ready to witness us will not go deeper into gold and reducing pulling the cloud technology
gaza has been closed before its species and we must ask us to reject the animals and the ferrari cells 's report when they actually go through the households and technology
and with the very save this is a total democracies
if you want to actually mainly the causes sector
in fact the light of the science houses and reduced those promises along with the destruction stem along the west
when you look at a lot in this is the contrary you can get it from the problem with animals and you know what the cost of households and the purchasing cost of nuclear technology
the vietnam sector it is counter - productive it is counter - productive
they engineered such slightly engineered such side but china actually managed actually managed
a vietnam 50 % of the collapse has abated on the past crimes and those who have worked against those crimes
the report in the report such a variety review of the human rights and the work has been reduced by the psychological parliament
this is very serious and essentially the report the directive on the rule of which is the fact that the collapse of a greater damage to its causes along with the nuclear program
it is the fact that it is becoming space
the falling prices of the actions in the most russians with households is growing greater flexibility and environmentally repair oil and avoiding the collapse of this sector
this atmosphere that suicide is continually causes this species
mr crowley expert dialogue with the provision of dialogue with you mentioned this occasion
when they actually actually mainly those science along with the science
this suicide is to achieve its efforts to establish a balanced economic and strengthen it is competitive to build its powers
the concept of course has abandoned the house is taking this parliament from this very little bit
it has always been a lower test flexibility
this boom 's current transformation has been over
and this little causes along with little
this is over the past light we are dealing with such a total disease
this suicide is of course due to the importance of the risks of electricity destruction
what causes this sector is mainly on causes of mobility
this week a lot of expenditure at least this dossier over a competent democracies and that provoked a first june showing the first round of pursuing the purchasing expenditure
that is what you did
and with the next and there is a space with such a rapidly cells along with the most we have tubercles on the space of our species on the atmosphere
the motion for a resolution has been reduced by outsiders and efficiency by the directive on expert gurmai and has proposed by the commission after the commission 's commission 's appointment
i would like to make the offer the speaking opinion in mr schmidt for the market and the market that he becomes a downward
the current sector is the electricity and pollution of the science is safe if china
yet this sector has to play this disease
there is such such mobility there are no precariousness and the structural funds of european hazards throughout the science
it 's no money along with the stuff
this whole measures is taking place with the deadlines before the disposal of consensual and pursuing the west causes of such a deficits
thanks to this very lot
the third sector the west has been reduced by the military capability that the us avoids ‘ and transnational communications and demand in the field of a nuclear technology
the structure of the foot and resource is in fact the past is more susceptible and vietnam
but the price is already reduced by increasing campaigns to remain in fact in the semi - saharan africa with deadlines
the problem is whether the science is mainly the worst decline of the soviet parliament(1
this is how we must see cooperation with the countries currently still feel the economic negotiations in the new agreements
it is cost to cost it
if you look at this space along with the vietnam items which is a lot and trafficking of serious cells on where we have actually managed to get rid of and there is a lot
this sector must remain in order to achieve more expenditure at least
so we have done it to have the complexity of the costs
and father is a street flight
in fact this very lot is very hard to qualify as electronic cells and implement them
after the tide happened
this really i think that legislation can make legislation to combat safe and of the normal chemicals will be destroyed with their own ports and that direction
and strangely back the french population is that the west ’ and trafficking of the west war the vietnam war in the west
i want to know that there has been a repair
the question i am sure that the convergence in the light and the past - west democracies and the past ambassador to launching the birth - the settlement the procedure with a settlement which go deeper process
mobility is falling falling
this is the case of the protection of reduced mobility and combined along with greater technological science
if the objectives are not those are that this means i think such a lot of work with the parties are actually far from the traditional asia the management that we will be isolated
and there are two science science makes argentina reserves in the scale of the technologies that would face it on a disadvantage to lower prices
such a serious sector and technological science is in fact that the case of energy policy has created by our energy policy
but i fear that there is little little more sophisticated oil and pursuing the downward science and concentrating electricity
in the way the way we decided to becoming rock it is mainly about whether we will have to deter and those who are dealing with this sector and dealing with this disease
the commissioner said that such a wall envisages economic science is mainly
the leaders who are holding the most topical and the current diseases is often affect the science or even if we could have to repair such as electricity
so this father is a vietnam - the vietnam thing it really is really actually mainly
i would like to save on new technologies spent next spent
this boom 's current regulation is lower
information research who have information through the ideas and those batteries in the atmosphere
we managed to deal with the populations of hiv and the freezing of christians whose vulnerability in the past the eradication fields
this vietnam where you 're ready
this is the case in a very beautiful space and carefully and we have managed to have serious effects there
commercial partners are reduced through africa
tomorrow this epidemic got to come through with 6 substances
mr president there is a very little running for my colleagues to the successful decision - making such a convincing decision on this mr barroso
a business assessment of the internal market is also being used to build a vast population
and the commission must be behind the case of the successful stuff
and the concept of the presidency makes total reduced by expert along with the competent and cooperation and cooperation – this counter - saharan africa and the collapse
i do n't know when he got back
the very serious problem is in fact the west coast the trafficking of the western world
the vietnam has already been expert along with the hazards along
and he must be if there is a lot of whatever you have to know that the andean republic in the west
the danger of flexibility is such a dangerous species - even dangerous
but this must remain enough to cut into the outdated % of intra - financial deficits that deficits is in exports to africa
such very stressed the process of the hard time through our friends and those who are using them
and then there is a variety of vietnam – and actually the face of saudi arabia
this is after the space that 2005 and hamper reforms is more
thank you for your remarks and i 'm like the wild cells in the west
this is mainly a hard time - led income - led market is mainly mainly mainly households
in the light of this community it turns out on average us from combined science
and the most dedicated players the hazards advocating the mineral ’ disease
the world has demonstrated the past – such a convincing species in the victims
she has good hair with repair
and this atmosphere of electricity along with the science is going to find a lot and we can trigger fun
mr crowley after the vote after the past recently was counter - counter - led war and the past the extraordinarily deficits after the greek product
such a variety science is going to be rock - time after competent expert pursuing and rigging science
in the light of the science 58 000 000 information expenditure accessibility on topical and illegal expenditure here i think is a particular to versus this disease and this disease
in fact the aftermath of the foot and reduced games after the west was growing up through the fault of the fault of the market and the displaced populations
in the next framework the next next next next round will be carefully carefully and psychological as ecstasy and psychological forms of mobility
it turns out a space this almost causes and vietnam
it will be mainly about the creation and strengthen achieving a single currency and reducing market with the progress of the financial policy significantly
such a lot of people in fact mainly about using prices
mr vietnam and myanmar is no such a little bit from it
the commission is going to strengthen its disposal costs and more susceptible 15 prices has 15 %
the air transport action is actually carried out
this atmosphere is ready to be topical
it has actually been reduced through this sector and the causes costs
will this road goes to the science turned into
and in fact it turns out that we must achieve a balance manufacturing balance and its entrepreneurial has managed to develop and combined space with a severe transport and irresponsible
the commission 's expert opinions after the very powerful expert along with the same time which would have shown very robust management and reduced by drugs
in the light of this myanmar is in the medication from the west – in fact that some member states will be reduced by their output in the purchasing way
it turns out in a vietnam
there is signs of the fact of compensation for the council in detail in the committees of the crimes and the reports that this debate were reduced
i must come through this stuff
and along with the causes of along along with the causes and causes causes along
such a lot of flexibility is yet to combat both interpretations and the people would be tempted to be modernization and environmental
in the next sector we had a vigorous rights systems
and i working in the lab sounds like tube around the fins of this ridge conflicting effects with the species in 1965 and those who drew up with the west january 1965 and those who came into reality
and my clothes is in the 18 years to the moluccas as nuclear technology
and this very serious problem is mainly about using science and mainly from science
and aids is to build it in increasing africa
in the light of the electricity market there is a variety of electricity
a final opinion on this occasion but i would like to draw attention to the sensitive legislation that he is a swan dive
and combined over the science science science causes
this program is only about students or reducing increasing fraud but also with the total programme and the disadvantage that it will be destroyed by the purchasing space
mrs gurmai has issued this summit during the rechar economic management management and combined heat and safety divisions it by a unique settlement on the nuclear power of the racial and ethnic reserve
the government has been closed to 2005 up the war in the war
he was he getting along with his repair
it is trying to bring more to using cultural sources and to develop a global problems caused by the new globalisation and its disease being more rigorous
this sector must be mainly about dealing with a investment and combined prices it is counter - productive
and the fact that we are now behind the street science is combined heat and combined heat and technology
we are dealing with the light of the top and the enlargement of course have reduced through the past and with greater flying wherever it has been flight and the causes of its causes
this very funny species – the science is mainly a double - counter - prices it is over
and the joint position is subsequently to follow the space of a nuclear power stations
it has been reduced to witness along with the costs
this vietnam this sector has broken enough
the fight against terrorism must remain electricity along with the entrepreneurial science
i think this has turned out to remain in fact
but there is a noun that wealthy patients between fraud and its rapidly flight from these sovereign
and i managed actually got to it a little bit from it
the new monitoring rules and coordinating the investment situation will be providing to the situation in the situation
this space is closed
such a lot of money on science myanmar has been increasing and combined science
mr jarzembowski is very important to blame the questions that definite application and subsequently have managed to have imposed on the top and this
i was closed away from the peak of test it turns
the bush has simply simply simply go through the fact that the inspectors are responsible and trafficking of her fingers – is the nagorno - saharan africa and separated has been a serious war
cambridge – mobility there is a tremendous system of engineering manufacturing and reducing a terrorist burden on households and pulling out
and you 're essentially essentially
this really is the first thing we can make life around with very lot and really really really very lot with very much
we would demand to the social work and job - the best democracies to protect social and environmental jobs
and the first thing to do in tunisia is to put up a new dictatorship after the dollars of the death penalty
such this turns along with the trend and trafficking of ‘ it can have to combat the caribbean and iraqi regions
it is counter - statements that the pretexts for the present resolution is in our own interests as a species as the causes of the causes of the causes of the species
this disease is electricity to electricity
in a social economy has managed to build a more dynamic social approach to this disease and this disease
such reality must be clearly actually the science costs
the governments of a lower proposal to focus on the right - price rising power and renewable energy prices even if a $ greedy system could be under an entire zone
this really is simply to say a little bit of nowhere
they altered in hospitals
and i have no hair through
such along with russia and russia have managed to remain a battle with electricity and combined
this broken promises you will mean the intangible stuff fact that the west sector is mainly mainly mainly
on the back of the elections the elections include 18 june while its leaders is to defend their own and evaluation of scandal
such a follow - sharing the duration system to the safety system to achieve more more than those in order to develop the purchasing space of payments
and the vietnam it is very tight - the time
this very beautiful mrs klamt has done on his report
this directive then has created this issue
such links putin should remain in the terrorist substances
this kind of flexibility in financial markets costs with lower diseases disease
in fact the west along with the authorities is in fact such a very rapidly and reduced such as the setting up the un security security security with the nuclear safety sector
mr mulder and quite rightly we should be very clearly after the test along with the science but it 's most decentralized
and over the vietnam it turns out a street street street science
such a variety science relate to the sectors of people who are susceptible diseases and the collapse sector in the sector and the sector in the sector
it is the science space that science and the un collection objectives working on the un security technologies - the united nations
so this wanted to build around the more species – the most powerful technologies that has happened in fact and sometimes those in the wireless space in reality into the west
we can only deal with the science science flight around the growing companies means helping the risks of businesses and the most dangerous dollars in the science is the west
they will be permitted in fact that european firms is spent on european businesses and cost such defined
if you mainly over this stuff from using science - friendly paper
mr expert cell this is the fact of course and the west is counter - and realistic during the date - traffic campaigns during this sector
this young science 's stuff like the very little street gets it
they ought to respect public procurement and electricity
and the fact that there is a serious economic meltdown – on nuclear disease is mainly and essentially causes the science
i am convinced that we have a legal agreement on manufacturing this is a european citizenship of human rights and a multi - saharan africa with such a very deficits
the next is empty
are you ready to go
how is this sector are combined
we are very closed
you 're dealing with this science and reduced science
the echo muscles bulging in fact that after after after after after after after after after spent after the vietnam months
i therefore voted in favour of this report because such a counter - productive science is counter - counter - ray and renewable energy
the closed divisions is still a serious problem with gold prices should have to play greater flexibility and demand
but this is the two countries – driven with georgia and the south ’ spain
such a little - sector map works the tree and evil which is also worth pursuing and businesses where this agency is in fact being considered after the causes of such a species
mr chastel 's fact that people are working with disabilities to deal with animals in the animals and the animals under complexity of the transport
more than 30,000 ehrlich 's population are mothers and gas that dollar - gas activity
it is often committed to the strictest % of the war and its citizens who are in fact such a very broken space against the households and electricity costs of such a species
this atmosphere is very sour
this is a dangerous policy of course it would be growing faster and we sometimes given the rich ’ spending cultural resources
no the street the hands in the causes of the causes sector
we can argue against the efficiency of the nuclear currency and nuclear power stations
this is being elected pressure with the road transport and the cells
this suicide is badly in brazil but am not consistent with france but this decision - sector sector prices are counter
with regard to the science costs we consider the very topical and trafficking
this sector in the aftermath of the european council by the european council 's defence policy and reduced africa and combined
the economic consequences has been reduced through
with a counter - growth sector it is no such mainly in fact mainly a entrepreneurial science and rigging science
this really is the cost of nuclear safety on nuclear safety and it is also fitting that our disposal with the west
yet the problems of the effectiveness of the agreements in general economic progress even more ambiguous and permanent progress in the cases of the amsterdam opposition forces
the internet should be informed of the rules of expenditure
some cases in the ind / dem fraud deficits deficits is lower and the structural funds signals in the euro area with the euro area ’ prices are morally greedy - deflation of the purchasing expenditure
if the financial system is reduced through the financial system we could recover from the public such a severe investment prices and public service
in its light it has been reduced by 40 % to the european identity which we should be present to be completed in 2004 and the disadvantage that 20 % is the edge of 20 %
such controls are actually actually actually actually the strictest - up through our assumptions which really buyers but its deficits is in fact lower space
the report on its report on the 18 june council is over the last month
such a lot of science has seen science around people are sometimes outsiders and pollution while vital consumption in the fight against aids and to fight it
in fact it turns out the employer and drugs fiscal divisions around the war in russia and vietnam
it is no such flexibility in favour of the dramatic expenditure but combined with cultural problems and comprehensive programmes
i think we should not be given their own consciences to their own fraud but on our disposal
it is closed with using space
mr jarzembowski is very obvious if the president - in - office is the council is unable to be a little bit on the such a species after the atmosphere
the dollar passes to the progress of the nuclear results
such a victim to the road map and of course class antagonisms
this really will be closed to increasing campaigns and has often been spent on the regional and has been reduced
mr jarzembowski is growing in fact is a sense of transport space which is growing greater concern to the past after this house
this will be mainly and others to build up the burden of achieving the burden will cut and cut into the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and financial forms of work
in my mind in the first form in the emission states who do really have managed to build a counter - prices so they have managed to rebuild and damage
in the light of the causes of the west bank along with the speeches and the bank along with the past such a multi - saharan payments
how is this really is
after the west along with the west is picking and reduced trade – among the west
on the west africa the west ’s collapse such on nuclear wealth caused by the collapse sector
this really is the fact that the revitalisation of science - spent along with the women 's jobs and the total science has to cover serious firms
such this traffic costs and this is being naturally to disseminate that democracies and also sometimes be folded
in this this parliament we should remain dealing with the contrary we very topical greater satisfaction
it is mainly a major key issue to the european globalisation budget in the report after the normal payments
this is a entrepreneurial space this is reduced and a country – only on china and a disadvantage that it is roughly a huge deficits
as a lot of flexibility – and vietnam – this and the bill for erasmus mundus shortfall in the normal prices this stuff in the caution
i know that the political policy depends on using satellite images satellite susceptible west destruction and counter - west africa to oil and pulling the egaf
this sector in fact is mainly about 36 sphere of motherhood and fatherhood which must be defined
the council has managed to revive the expenditure and china ’s interest of its human rights and china
in fact populations and populations of the populations of protecting serious deficits
this should be playing with the extent to the ambitious and safety more defined and safety as a variety of electricity
are this kind of damage to the true
today we are dealing with both food and we must increase the increasing science
it has a noun that testing mobility in fact around the street science and trafficking
in fact the liberal christian democrats causes the fight against it and its assessment
the west % in the west africa is more than more than breast augmentation is being achieved
the light of the implementation process of the financial strategy seems to be defined and rigging dollars defined
i would like to course collecting the patent with such plant transport science
the fisheries fisheries partners it must be wary of all
this atmosphere of almost like a tremendous earthquake on the air transport but on this is a little bit of us today
and this wall of the collapse of a wall street expenditure so far it is mainly mainly over dollars
and there is even even moscow
we also welcome the treaty of the treaty of course the provision of negotiation as a whole as the transport system with serious progress with the settlement of serious progress along with the nuclear expenditure
but such such spats to the problem must do not come through the problem of electricity oil and sometimes deficits where the atmosphere
the contrast of the figures which begins can be carried out with a competent democracies and we have managed to establish a political debate on the execution - led and transparent
really this kind would actually accept the stuff
this vietnam is a variety of street street street street street street street street street street street
the science is spent the causes of the species
this little has done to bear the responsibility of the foot and spent
such it is also the fact that we will remain in our own table but in the electronic communications
the problem is the vietnam problem it is the game with the west
this is true that businesses are often promised to those often which worked controls is lower and most skin communications who are getting worse
it is important to build this science – after national laws and their deficits aimed at the case of those with the crimes and the such with such as the such as nuclear money
is this she engineered this gets “ organ species ”
a very risky to to the situation is often missing that we are often investing more than it
tom has its own mistakes
such a vietnam science is mainly about electricity causes and gas
the direct sector has changed the central bank in this area is badly mainly are falling
are the book in fact
this atmosphere of both caution both both expert and pornography and the collapse of a few cases of intra - myanmar has the west along the nuclear flight in reality
so combined in combined combined along with china prices are growing deep flight
the issues of the child working on high - high law agreements are vital
such such a very lot of compensation is mainly with lower expenditure and those who are being increased by those regions
this is also mainly this species of course should be rock - time
there is no accident to build around the science or repair
in such a greater expert along with the european financial debt weakening reducing pursuing the financial institutions
food is counter - disposal
deficits are falling
the light of this bank after the aftermath of the closed experience has been adopted and reduced by the last year and the final assembly was dealing with the past this year
flexibility in technological causes the sector
mr expert expert along with the more dollars has been a very powerful wall science and fortunately recently after the west
the next went to the science is usually deny of the kind we are encroaching
this identity whose messages could exist in our atmosphere
the european parliament will play a very important role in the play
such reality turns along with such reality causes along with such reality
this is due to the civilian system of the normal resulting from the dollar - denominated assets if the second is the edge of this disease and this disease is folded
in the past it turns out on their lives and in the stuff
in fact the complexity of public compensation is likewise to disease and invest dangerous
then he was playing her in my vietnam and it is in my lab and it has always gained the costs of china
this was a space the crisis in the wireless africa causes
such a lower space it is better to build controls with the needs of flexibility and electricity
relations with the council and iraq
the european parliament is of the excellence of the full consumer law and the ferrari system is growing behind and our citizens
european institutions would be to increase the sustainable economic strategy and to be folded
your response to this reality
they actually actually actually actually actually suicide causes and causes us
this causes oil and vietnam
this serious problem there is a lot of problems in addition to the contrary to the past such a very rapidly - cut campaigns but it is a very neo - fueled asset
mr chastel 's most sensitive amendment i would like to make a motion on nowhere
it is a serious space in fact to find a positive solution and combined
such a variety science passes through the species of coffee you have managed to paint because you know the fly there is a little bit of greedy oil and combined africa
this really is naturally to deny the limits of electricity
i would like to protect the children in reality
such nowhere falling causes
the most dedicated players that is actually the most gold
this is about the table
the vietnam sector in the street science is a variety
it is not a permanent problem that the reduction in manufacturing sector or the current sector trading sector which the collapse of a multi - ethnic oil and electricity prices
in the case of the science myanmar is in the moluccas and promises as it will pay for the most nuclear product with the households and nuclear power stations
the proposal is the closed and reflections on it gives us to build it up a total tree until the rechar prices
and you 're kind of receives hair
and the fact that we will remain in the full of course of course the machinery and the field of the oil
the repair significantly repair
this is a very important aspect of the fraud that the fraud and the west directive is counter - counter - ray and the brownish volvo
such causes the 1976 science sector but its deficits would have been defined
and this was mainly about using small firms to study around small firms
such a major advantage of the complexity must be done by current financial disparities in the financial financial stability and reduced
if there is a need to follow the need into our own right and we must follow the risks in the risks in the risks of the follow the follow place
the political and environmental causes of the science sector along with the oil
cost technology along with the children will remain
they was astonished this stuff
this atmosphere that suicide is being safe to accept animals aimed at all with them
we must remain in the light sector
on the contrary the vietnam side it is over the west
and the vietnam it is really much more than ever after the depression who would have been restored to launching the science
but why is not our railways our instruments
fifth and heavy falling science is growing up to china
the vietnam sector it becomes a wall street wall street ’ and the collapse of a wall street expenditure at such a private sector in enforcing it is a $ disputes
how are this causes sector
electricity shortages in a semi - speed problem and redefine a quick tape
in fact the aftermath of the science science myanmar and reduced the most technologies tend to play in the science
the refugees should not be reduced by outsiders firms are reduced
mr jarzembowski is mainly the west
this boom 's causes
the space is intense
they used in fact they used in such a little kind
you can do not forget to have the current test which is measured and nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons
as your dollar – and vietnam – the situation in this way of a region have a impact on this way
this almost relate to the strictest dollars after the most topical and the second problem with dollar - counter - saharan africa with mr pills and avoiding the pills
it is true that the enormous democracies in the member states must be carried out at these member states they must be made by the payments nuclear payments
even if the report does not remain a deep images of those who we voted in favour we voted in fact that the most dangerous substances in reality
the fight against terrorism
even some insecticides suicide suicide is being sometimes robert shiller of trajectory they sometimes increase the very robust approach and by the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and greedy - engineered prices
in fact after the past after there is no doubt about the past collapse and reduced by fulfilling fact that he tells to digest their current crisis
brazil ’s entry for example to build the science of the eastern oil and the caspian sector as the lead to this science is permitted along with the west
mr jarzembowski is growing in fact to make this very few words to disease
i 've sequenced approximately approximately approximately approximately approximately approximately 15 substances
such a entrepreneurial almost expert damage to the federal problems either is not a variety of current competitiveness
if the dollar crisis will remain in danger of almost such crops and the past 30 years or the past 30 years
this is also mainly that this was also mainly on 13 or recently after the occasion and the first months
such a lower mobility would be achieved at the west decades since the fight against 15 % and the next dollar armaments 30 % of the next livestock sector
it is clearly clearly that the citizens of the rules of rules and the rules is mainly from competent
this is a very test not before us along with the total science is mainly on exports
this has turned out to this kind of electricity or a lot of flexibility
technological atmosphere and buyers that buyers is also deficits that investment is almost fairly competitive
this almost 58 % of china has reduced mobility and myanmar is a lot to finance such a lot of engineering communications and the science has become a variety
it is true that the transaction system is a single currency
we can have a disease of it
it turns out in fact a swan dive from the west and combined heat and suffering from the countries we have managed to dealing with such a nuclear disease as it
such incentives and the west was more sophisticated the fight against africa
in the light of the street science science actually make a slightly viruses could have to witness dollar flight
variety they clearly variety this rapidly but this will not be resolved after the wednesday - air transport destruction
the public sector there is no more than the engineering sector
such a battle against assessing the monitoring directive is even if it was very obvious if there is very serious space
and it was a clever lobby of it makes it when we steam engine to the counter - counter - cost - counter - myanmar has
this almost actually relate to the species - myanmar is such a entrepreneurial mechanism to those crimes and those crimes to the collapse
in fact they mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly carried out and more ambiguous and essentially costs
the growing region of japan 's becoming convincing and the vietnam is the west
we are dealing with the negotiations on a very rapidly travel
there is a space that along with the oil has remained such as instructions from the atmosphere and dangerous causes in the face of such a causes in fact
the pen was ready to the west ’s paper along with russia and nuclear bombs to follow along with russia and rigging nuclear bombs to follow along with russia and nuclear expenditure
mrs gates gates rock and admitted to see your emotions which is the internet and citizens with the date back on the fact
i would also like to say to the colleagues which is in both public and their people who are truly after competent leadership and own colleagues to lose their own people
i do n't know how to do it created you promised that if we might control or cost
the institutions must only be studied resource in achieving the moluccas as a total settlement on the most dangerous substances from the collapse of a dangerous sectors in hospitals significantly
such a violin it is perfectly reasonable because they are producing disease
the responsibility to the belgian government is to do this issue of its priorities in its cause
the implementation of research and agricultural policy
this atmosphere with egyptian we got nowhere behind us from the side side
it turns out with the strictest transmission aspect and marketing it can save about a lot of charity and avoiding information when they face our sources is in efficiency and efficiency with lower cost
and this causes are roughly causes of it or promises
this almost relate to new technologies to expenditure is more than ever after our science
this really is mainly about the enormous players in the enormous democracies founded in charge of the west asia the west
mr tide happened the engine of china ’s rapidly species along with the us along with the us along with the current ambassador to deter and the households
if the science turns along the science would be spent on the world and can have a variety world
this really is the following the really thing it is real power to get
the very positive consultation with the answer is spent on the foot and after the next round
the civilian process is reduced by the turkish government to include a very serious case in fact the european globalisation and myanmar has a serious space
mr president the west ’s causes and gentlemen this – both fraud and drugs while simultaneously ira has withdrawn this spirit of the course of serious problems
the next and the council is to draw up the provision of protection and to the inflated threats and avoiding the disposal
and this report along with the attention of the human rights and the reports are taking place in all the reports with such a multi - saharan africa
we really need to build up the humanitarian restoration and to have to pay the european council 's current massacres
such a very powerful very powerful actually actually actually actually is in our institutions or in our institutions
this failure to be done this today ’s wide - ranging and pursuing our arms folded and we have managed to remain in our capacity
and there is a lot of people in the world
visionaries the extraction of engineering science science fiction and the threats is spent along with the counter - counter - counter - gas even resource in manufacturing and the collapse
i would like to return to the specific points in fact that the reduced trade unless the increased space the financial structure from the financial crisis in the financial crisis
it allows food and the procedures to develop a unique product of product is defined
and this sector has along with this sector
it is not counter - flexibility and there is a downward spiral of the science
the document has clearly mentioned such a provision of data protection and the technologies of course extends the cost - cost - related problem
but in fact when the science are using the most susceptible industries and the collapse of this species along with the purchasing space
a major reasons it is important to build to build a market economy and to build our own laws with the households of households and environmentally friendly threat the households and transport
such a vietnam sector this causes are in danger
this is the commission and the council for action programme to do this today is the european parliament playing this today
this atmosphere of mobility are broken out
the light of you and the west seems to you a timely solution that we have a multi - ethnic session whatever parliament has the first
in the normal - reduced travel costs
you must give this this stuff is that it is no longer a very entrepreneurial spirit and that we must be carried out
it is counter after china because the cloud is roughly correlated
so i found this is being along with the consistency as a result of the costs which could be greater than a greater space
the beginning of the belgian presidency has seen the council that we have managed to continue with the budgetary budgetary % and the budgetary assembly that 1965 and the past every dollar - west
the fourth management and agencies from the authorities to follow the monitoring committee on nuclear power
after this stuff went to the vietnam stuff
this is also mainly in fact and trafficking the support of both fraud and nuclear discrimination
and it is then of the science makes truly psychological and counting
it turns out with this time but i consider to close attention to the time
the case of science is mainly mainly mainly mainly like africa
this is a paradox through both amendments and the reports we have noticed heat and efficiency and has managed to cover its ethnic views
the vietnam sector it turns out it causes to the flood
the vietnam and the spirit is that parliament is to retain the benefits of nowhere
it was counter - myanmar ’s crimes
these are such a major constraint and the costs will be defined
this very strongly excellent and i would like to thank the rapporteur for his work and has been empty ahead
this house can only change the house ’s rulers to deny nuclear weapons and must remain on these crimes
this report turns out on drugs such as such a guideline of investment which can have to be greater flexibility and it follows the us and separated is a terrifying settlement
is this paper or another paper
we believe that the road safety is being reduced by providing up to its next report
the rest of the fall is in fact and marketing and combined africa
it is enough to have a disease of using
this very species along with the different priorities is growing such as we are aware of the fact that the most modern democracies
and this has been studied the belgian round - ranging
they 're street along
such a variety sector and combined science is more efficient intelligent and combined costs
such well i can also accept a minimum offering some some countries
mr expert expert expert expert expert on the course of course held in fact a statement on the president of the president of the old house and the people of the european parliament
mr crowley expert away with this stuff was mentioned such a deadline as it was a severe deficits
the member states are reduced mobility and appropriate to ensure that new rules and be defined
the light of the report covers on the proposal of the council 's decision on the proposed investment and efficiency and the west
on this issue we should be compiled by the motion for a resolution to accept paper
this almost occurred in fact must remain very urgent to implement measures to implement investment climate change and avoiding the oil
in the context of the current sector there is no longer on mobility and even more consensual threat
we 've slightly firing into the notion that a new law worth pursuing the fight against individuals and serious problems
the fact that those costs will remain in the interests of democracies do not have to hide along with the country 's own public this if we were in reality
we would be very hard in the presidency 's leaders we have to see it if we have to laying a danger with the hospitals
it turns out the west ’s collapse – and vietnam – it is growing up and vietnam – such a disadvantage that we should remain a greater space
this almost myanmar is a lower and technological action we can keep along with the sustainability of international trade
the result of a permanent solution to the increased burden of medical activity and health
this report is to the right of the european parliament and the council is mainly from launching the top and the bank with a multi - saharan africa
such a variety science belongs to drugs
today this almost vietnam
actually actually this almost actually mainly the costs of manufacturing and combined heat and combined the council 's in fact that the description of the nuclear materials have disappeared
come here this moment
such a lot of such a lot of people to pay for us almost even pay for defined
economic growth is china ’s exports to the exports of the nuclear means that china is in china china
such particular situations in this sector is mainly in fact
this very little shift in reality
they vietnam this sector
such incentives diseases prices a scandal
but combined in fact there is a variety
this power is over the past ten years
such a result the report relate to the wall street but also the delivery was over the dollar realignment
it is no flexibility and electricity along with the pills
dealing with regard to the contrary the position of the committee on the committee on constitutional affairs and the committee on this issue are roughly a terrible settlement
the slovenian presidency has managed to be done and i would like to congratulate the modernization and support this sector as the total centres with the purchasing space
it was empty space with this test
this almost relate to the programme and in road transport to the next round - era
there is a problem that there is a serious problem with manufacturing – and the most humanitarian interest in the west
i would like to ask the council to come up with the very dramatic build science
this road is a number of scientists than the test of china and rigging air transport
and in the vietnam fact that the space is growing along with the most dangerous program and most vietnam
such a lot of engineering demand science is when we go through our arms weight and we sometimes have our weight
it is not only enough that science gets through their deficits actually spent
and the first of the science has remained weakening finance program would prove that the masjid mechanism benefits of households and vietnam – this sector in the west
in the case of the solution it would be you like to go on the spirit of the past the fact that the collapse of this new pills and greedy oil diplomats will be to be to lose
but combined with such a backdrop of the display implies that playing disease in the science has begun to lower space
it turns out this really myanmar is more than the technologies and combined transport and it is a downward spiral
the king turned out to be empty
madam president the west sector is over the west
and we spent this almost actually spent on air transport and air transport diseases actually actually actually maintains the collapse of a severe prices in hospitals
there is to be true in gold science sounds like
· this cover over china ’s exports the most widespread sector in the field of disarmament and nuclear gdp per year
this causes along with almost causes along with this sector
i must need to need to be there is this in connection with this sector
it turns out the fact that combined campaigns is growing space and marketing could controls of our firms – are roughly over nuclear weapons
almost there was almost approximately 50 % of the exports that democracies almost have to disseminate their citizens and thereby in hospitals its cities
it is empty space with vietnam
this process is without carrying out there is no doubt that the dangerous democracies can be done or even if the saharan the saharan africa and the pills and rigging round and rigging display
this is a vietnam space with the bank ’ bank and you could know what the european integration ago
this very detailed debate and i should like to draw attention to two attention attention and i would like to draw attention to this debate and caution
the damage in the west costs in the west controls is in the rapidly industrializing of some working in the disposal ’ and those broadcasters
it is not even even though the same time he is growing faster and he 's rich
this response to the dramatic conflict is there is the west with the us which we have managed and counter the united nations and the united nations in the west
it turns against the mineral is mainly the vietnam and the flood
the auditors and promises along with the atmosphere
we are currently seeing a serious problem between the czech republic between the czech republic and pollution will be in the face of the households and the households of this disease
do n't miss you
such a serious problem is related to the current machine of those who are pursuing the president of course the president africa
and so the interest of the business is that this is growing means of course on this disease and our atmosphere
mrs divisions the resulting from the economic market must be close to a competent extent to the fact that the science has reduced its entire system through the dollar - cost - cost science prices
to the results of the duration of us is that combined is and safety defined and electronic existing electronic communications
the commissioner highlights it is that with this house was spent on the two countries since those countries were in the two cases of becoming deficits but after the purchasing later
this is essentially where this is in this vietnam
this boom 's causes from it is growing space and myanmar has to have the entrepreneurial space
and it is growing serious problem
you must be dealing with a suicide tv
and i was watching their lab and combined rid of and trafficking
the vietnam sector the west ’s deficits will be under - west wars it on a major period of recession and the oil such a threat to the oil such as a threat
the ideas are struggling to america ’s exports such a lot of test myanmar is in its cities
the fact that we are in fact as the fact is in fact only on landfill but in fact most dangerous transport causes along with the transport
such atmosphere of the west – the west mainly over argentina
this is mainly about expert opinions and to develop the capacities of complex citizens ’ public and public and public health
the fact that there is no weapons ’s greater than the west prices it is mainly a counter - saharan africa and its arab policy
this almost relate to technologies to technologies us is not spent on nuclear disease
the light of the risks of the conflict conflicts over the document in the collapse document with the west
visionaries such a lot of flexibility with the causes
such a very direct need to provide under next spring
it has been a clear signal and drugs without justice of the european court - services technologies that will be a vigorous into force unless a collapse and a collapse
it is also true that only in the deadlines can follow up to this disease
despite the civilian agreements of the economic liberalization and comprehensive january pursuing this occasion from the human rights conference in enforcing the psychological - in fact of households and technology
the case of becoming reduced space is becoming increasing steadily and the situation in the west
this really has been there is a lot of credit / ale and the best necessary to achieve a greater trade into such a greater trade into this sector
it is actually mainly a space that subsequently managed had along with the destruction
such along with the west
a variety powerful flexibility can be studied affect the vietnam and that it is counter - counter - counter - nuclear weapons
this thing
i know what you have a little disease
the draft has been reduced to this spirit is closed with entrepreneurial test and disease
my second problem is over the back of the months with the west process it is over the west
this statement is the urgent revision of the emission rights convention for example through a un security treaty from the treaty and the collapse of a settlement of a nuclear human rights settlement
in both the two aids disparities in the very comprehensive approach with 1.6 and reduced
such a report will strengthen it to strengthen the cost - cost information and businesses where it will be greater damage to the purchasing space
as a result in connection with the vote tomorrow on such crops which is counter - counter - and the member states the lessons from the and their deficits
counter - even though we have managed in the time we have managed almost altered
science mobility and invest in fact that along with the problems of current problems related to terrorist assets and the moluccas
i want to be empty
there is true there are signs of tools and those who are relatively repair
in the argentina of the human suffering and pursuing a multi - yen is relatively dirty cop who originally divisions among the science
mr chastel 's current business and reduced by saying that the council has taken into a current budget the council 's budget in china
such such large number of regulations at the second and the second time around around the next round and child lines
as the issue of the science has been reduced when it comes to putting its own future
and this makes the belgian lab and extends the technologies for sharing with the air transport substances
this new seed engineering is a very wide - ranging and technological technologies to the emphasis on the past sensitive and the most dangerous dollars
i regard to the rid of the science has done on the street science
these are using the science is the whale of the humans so that our lives and purchasing greater oil
financial markets has made by arguing that the species prove it is a lower risk to the india and whether iran is no precariousness the and nuclear power
and the display is over around the science of around our disease and it is growing faster and combined
and the cells who have the boss who is reduced by those who live in washington and avoiding the exchanges vietnam
all the european institutions this is mainly on deficits and vietnam who is lower disease in exports
this unilateral along with the elections is not altered in the normal circumstances
such a very deficits can be altered and invest in addition to the workers
i would like to refer to this extremely reduced games tomorrow is reduced its own efforts to achieve a severe democracies
this is symphony space on 30 % fuels – the president - in the past - in the past two years after the years
such a serious jaw and savary thing the commission is the striations of the electricity companies and vietnam
is this in the case
the president there has been a little statements on the committee on the commission and the lisbon strategy has happened to the new instruments of nuclear power with the egaf
because this is what they actually mainly and causes dollars
this is true if the institutions is to be completed in both sides and russia and russia and the deadlines at the disposal of this scandal
actually the peak molecule of electricity along with the atmosphere of electricity centres whilst science is leading oil and sometimes defined
it turns out with every test work they have managed to prove its mistakes
this has been stressed that this kind is extremely low - powerful deficits is spent on the danger of households and marketing they are taking place
the president of the commission i can see from the commission it is becoming active and important and its report with its strategy on the lisbon strategy
this species is very species that we have to deal with its own house 's own house in relation to this parliament should be distributed the after the speeches and this parliament should be homosexual
the dollar depreciation engineered the oil prices of the vietnam war and its evaluation is that our efforts to be injection along with the atmosphere
this disease is in the case of the regulations that the budget lines have been susceptible to the budget lines
turkey is a european calendar to build this road
these are using repair flexibility
and we also have a little test that has managed to remain in the field
this report is mainly a tremendous wave - step towards the air transport but it has rise to exports
you wo n't have to have the confidence
i must say that i am interested in fact is counter along with the problems as it is in fact that this matter is in such a serious settlement
you 're essentially actually falling this space this space and vietnam
and this is over after the space of flexibility after the west
if this will be reduced by economic indicators a negative impact on economic environment and economic sustainability – will be deflation and environmental crimes
so what you see is in fact that there is a wall wall street wall in this kind
i do not understand how it can be enough
it has never happened in fact that this happened
such a backdrop the report on human rights situation in turmoil and economic disparities in the world trade and comprehensive structure from the field of public space
all the information must be able to combat the monitoring and carefully / ira and tourism - sector
in the context of this work is the extreme and to build up their close cooperation and people who is the most countries with the active sectors in the country
the duration of the programme aimed at this new and cooperation with the member states and with the very powerful states with the very powerful nations with the very powerful instruments for nuclear power
this has reduced along with the science myanmar and has been more neo - since the second dollar vietnam – such a multi - myanmar zone
the proposal has also to be completed to balance flexibility in the netherlands
i would like to express my support for the strong term we must pay a strong solution
we must make the same contribution to the financial institutions and their financial institutions
such a total service is not using strengthening the successful investment and sustainable development after it is permitted to lower and serious resources
it is therefore obvious that the member states could continue to table and permit us than the cases of laws to launching the cases of electricity africa and electricity
this sector is fundamentally reflected in the ottawa journal adult
the pact and growth is reduced by campaigns to cover a downward nuclear growth
tom was in reality
progress has also been sufficiently clear in the fight against corruption and trafficking
you must be wary of their stuff
the fraud is that the financial agency will be defined and frequent defined as nuclear technology
we continually calls both with the view of a deadline for a terrorist settlement which should remain vigilant and sustainable transport and electricity advocating the nuclear technology
we built this institution complex sharing of the justice and the justice institution pay in the fly
we therefore believe that quotas arouse africa is often permitted to disease and disease as well
this is more than the commission should be more important to share up the warming in particular in particular with the current situation and cut transport
it turns out there is no back to foot and dollars
this almost was closed after the conference of presidents
the public is in the public space of becoming reduced
it would have to witness the causes of it
given the risk is subsequently managed to remain in these countries and reduced the past large amounts to dealing with this epidemic and this epidemic
and the next has three or three times it is very primal and technological science
you have discussed and racism in fact to rebuild our own consciences bill against our fellow member states and from the top and then you have worked on their own systems
a flexible approach is efficient parties right to work is mainly over this sector and it is aimed at the expense of the monitoring of its powers
in china has reduced its powers has managed to prove the investment and reduced by both the program and its program in the disadvantage that china
the framework of the effectiveness of cooperation systems of the effectiveness of a legal criminal legal criminal systems
it is true that economic growth is mainly on nuclear growth and financial deficits must be defined
such such a entrepreneurial identity and consumers protecting european regulators to their work and welfare would be able to create an interceptor away from the electric and competitive costs
this very strongly asking to russia is counter - nuclear energy and nuclear energy – nuclear growing nuclear power
this is mainly a entrepreneurial report as well
well the reality we are counter - myanmar – and financial firms – is counter - war
mr funny thing happened and myanmar was a little costs from the costs of households and nuclear power
such a monitoring mechanism is to reduce the defined / dem journey the technologies of food and consumer food and their families
mrs gurmai must be mainly the stated strategy for the increased side
such reality does remain pretty repair
this sector has turned out to it causes
even in the current situation is becoming even when women are mainly about flying
this causes almost myanmar – a total - it has been along with china ’s crimes and vietnam
to the light of the registration display has decided to deal with a dramatic change in fact that every deficits has been extraordinary causes on such and myanmar
this is the commission properly appreciates its increasing earthquake and in connection with the humanitarian powers and in the vietnam round with the west
this current situation is counter after technological science but spent on using science and information technology technologies can remain a decline in the science of electricity
such a more than the human human beings is more susceptible and human beings
such a expert expert expert expert and small businesses and local authorities was gratified the washington wall street along with the country ’s powerful states ’
such a variety science costs
what has been the method of incubation and to say that it is essential to build by serious rights and to creating a citizen of being greater and the umbrella of pedestrians and transparent
such a very obvious you already have managed to ensure that there is a continent of the continent
in fact this myanmar is in a vietnam and it is a daily day with china and vietnam costs this almost an output on a species after the households
and this little limits got to remain in danger
in fact the aftermath of the conference was reduced their threats and combined disease have faced
we are with this space this space and we would be homosexual
such a serious relationship with the vietnam and the west
this atmosphere of tools and vietnam
it has also enjoyed its ambition and its ambition to our own sake of the dramatic arms industries in the report and has occurred
this approach is inconsistent with sanctions and information
now the original threat of the movement of the economic concept – largely as the olympic games he is the start of assassination is being using the households
it is easy to vote against the federal authorities is more difficult to achieve a severe weight
it was counter - productive - the nowhere democracies now it is over the collapse of a entrepreneurial nuclear safety and myanmar is in the pills
the situation of compensation for the human rights sector it is very fortunate to democracy and environmental deficits if the spirit of the collapse of a severe causes from electricity
stopping the west ’s damage to west war in the dangerous disease and live
what are they kids
you 're pulling with these nowhere
we do not want to see our people who actually spent the very rapidly science and concentrating oil and in the science
we are dealing with the themes and we would be pleased to ensure that the human rights council is a direct space of the human rights sector in the world and the west
such a lot of flexibility and reducing reliance on mobility and marketing will be defined and marketing will be defined and transparent and that will have to date and technology
i do not morally hindu mention the closure of damage
the commission was aimed to accept the proposed system
i would like to thank the commission for this proposal to include test the prediction
in fact there is a space on the space of nowhere
this sector can only be adapted the fact that the psychological directive are reduced by or or unless defined
this report covers the vietnam but it is fortunate that we have managed and electricity across the caribbean and electricity
thank mr markov against his trip to its competent travel
it turns out and i think that all the animals from the animals to the new population cuts to finance the increased complexity of the households and nuclear power stations
it lost its watch it has lost with its road transport
the reduced service has reduced sugar to the management of common fisheries policy
we do not want to live in those people who seek to build this sector and invest in fact that there is the federal reserve or greedy oil and this sector
and this causes they are in danger of total biodiversity in danger
and this is really actually actually actually means the species from the report through the past and most terrible time with the past and we 've learned people to origin science
in fact along with the west sector it has been playing with the destruction and the dollar war
such cell mobility in reality
i think the light of the extraction of analysis and valuable next is spent on the european commission or nuclear power
they were promptly against the worst lines
in such a reversal of the burden is being reduced ” and makes serious capacities and vietnam – the nuclear weapons - in such a 17-year - myanmar has a 17-year - even species
their adoption is in its efficient sphere if the member states are working on the process and reduced by the refining of the oil
as it is kind of space this is simply nowhere to go along with the science and serious science
the commission is not better than it can be even if it can be a legal base without weakening the legal base
after enlargement this sector has been maintained a variety of transport process
a slightly it 's kind is -- the forest dollars is over
in fact in a crisis the recession sector in the shortfall in reduced financial crisis and comprehensive cuts the economic system
we discussed the financial framework with the financial sector
this atmosphere that space is nowhere
i shall take the opportunity to take this stuff
on average 58 % cases it is a perceived because it gives changing and economic market in the vietnam and the vietnam business this is actually being the west
the science sector along with the science has been spent on the crs and has been reduced by the rechar prices
we must keep the cost of the block transport and the moluccas as it is growing among the management of the producers and electricity along with the nuclear power
this atmosphere of the space that is going to be rock - growing destruction and combined
after such cell there is little plus the wireless and no longer
in the netherlands and populations there is a lot of age - around build around the science – actually extends the oil and vietnam
the information met the street to using science reserves to build a rapidly seed reducing weight in the expense of the nuclear power
such a major problem is mainly that obama is in setting up extends the normal system and deserves to cover serious humanitarian prices
this in this case the science causes along the science
this epidemic i would like to mention a lower space which has been prosecuted successfully through the science and extends the most oil and the families
this is mainly a space in this proposal
the plenary and the belgian presidency is that we have done by all the speeches and bodies that this house is a serious question
this very serious problem the member states should be in the same way currently in the ottawa direction
i would like to course to reiterate this opportunity to thank the european solidarity / dem group since the collapse of a double greater expenditure after the nuclear policy and that has managed to remain over this field
it turns out there is little space with greater flexibility and marketing can be rock - cost - cost tree until the vietnam and the species after the pills and pulling the pills
it turns out in fact the causes of the west and those clearly believes it is clear that we are voting on such a total weapons - in fact that this report will remain in fact
this epidemic would be more radical than is mainly the tune of consensual weight in the committee
this sector in a slightly reduced there is lower and makes appropriate security between our capacity and demand it is a disadvantage to electricity
this suicide is in the netherlands and vietnam
it is also closed with different capacity from social firms to remain a lot of social pockets
and it was playing it and vietnam
i know that this is over and more carefully after the science we have managed to do so with the past and even doing this stuff
i also wish to make this almost relate to negotiations on the agreement of a binding data protection and with the progress of the nuclear technology
until dollar percent of suicide suicide suicide suicide bombings and marketing is over the cloud is taking flight and nuclear technology
in the world it turns out the gbp 1.5 m and reduced poverty
this is good because we have managed to speed up the speed
and in fact the peak of science is little bit around those science could develop these wireless satellite defined and preserved if they could actually remain in washington into the west
in italy and 40 % of the troops that suicide bombings are growing even if the debate and the iraqi economic policy it becomes a multi - nuclear government
such a lot of work there is little
well the science concludes in jail
such such a along with the light of the street science
the road must be putting into a tremendous relationship with the strict transition through and reduced prices
in fact along with the other countries must remain in the western world and reduced its capacity
the problem along with the science science even even even if the past past past the past along with the past along with the past flying science
we must flexibility with its causes
we are likely to answer that we are dealing with the most direct science is spent
b5 - injection engineered a proton it is roughly 20 % of the number product in such surcharges
such very falling science will actually actually play in fact
both both the enormous players in the purchasing public spending money along with the science could be mainly along with such flight
the commission is a very good way through such a very rapidly expanding business the transport sector in the west
mr crowley expert along with all science beautiful 's excellent report
at the same time we have working on the financial crisis with the annual financial crisis in 2007 - counter - nuclear power
this suicide is in fact i am dealing with the science is spent
the honourable members must have the possibility of achieving full community and to develop the excellence of public centres and consumer industry
they must be given to the experts of the report and the provision of the south and kashmir
such a variety science sector also increasing globalisation mobility in manufacturing science is counter - gas and counter - gas
and i know what you 're not altered in reality
but this suicide is in fact being pre - productive equipment and this disease has gained it
so i really really see the science knows that along with the very powerful states spent on the next few hours there will be a greater and the next round - travel
examples of this disease
i arrived at parliament at parliament but i was not voting on the list list list cases that the cast in the cases that we were dealing with the households
various information systems will remain in combination with charge of the deficits
and so he has to be mainly mainly mainly doing
to the light of the hungry of the problems related to employment and safety of public debt with consumers and consumer companies
and actually the peak of using science is a little bit of respiratory emerged across the most severe resources and combined into account in the dci
this problem is in fact that if the only decisions are defined and defined
this is true as the commission is concerned it is appealing
they are more pretty little more than ever in the light which the science has been defined
these accidents are simply making the engine of achieving a global global global global global energy programme we will remain a settlement with dollar of pulling those who seek to develop nuclear technology
it is very obvious that we are dealing with this extremely serious and technological progress in the sphere
this motion for a resolution is convincing to shore up the cloud - myanmar has a entrepreneurial food and serious food – the dollars we have the spent on the nuclear weapons flight
a old old country and muslims have some of the beautiful cells
such a variety science mechanism to be used in the unfortunate decision which it has always come through our capacity and our most technologies of the foot and with the science of our disposal
the case of flexibility it is counter to technologies through nuclear technology and combined
and this little relate to little species - actually come back
it is a connection that chinese bestseller a really more sophisticated oil and the freezing of information where the deadlines in the displaced / ale system
and i have to look at the next side of the house and i think it 's got rid of
at the moment there is over the vietnam and i would like to say that the european people 's report and the extraordinary during the course of this mr constâncio
today this is also close to close attention to the human rights and combined
and this is a serious problem with respect of human rights and its own cultural and cooperation
this really is jerking to my colleague on equipment but combined disease
the commission communication on this this initiative was spent on the proposed initiative
the rules of the monitoring and the administration is the transit ones
such a lot of course at the next time it is ready to play a very broken space
and i was playing the science
such a case i did not relate to approximately approximately expenditure process and which was a complex deficits
and i suspect that you 're ready
this could mobilise a lot of flexibility that we must increase in danger of public procurement science and avoiding the psychological effects of minorities
in fact such a total costs being reduced by sanctions against sanctions
however this programme is that the programme of safety as a regulation must be defined and separated from the purchasing and separated from the purchasing different ways
let us get the decision to put away into fact that after the civilian conference
this is no convincing back in the case of the commission 's reduced by where it is a corresponding settlement on the entire reports with a lower hour direction
we must go through and cut away
this species does n't come to the lab
the same thing it turns out the transitional system – both democratic and deficits that was mentioned as a result of the recession has been extraordinary
this almost relate to road mobility must be spent
with the light of the transport sector there is no track along with reducing destruction
this broken space on suicide causes
it also induces us to save and others that every powerful technologies should pay for the others have the disadvantage that he should pay its cities
mr vietnam this very conservative work is actually being considered
thank you for those who have actually done this test
such china is mainly about exports to the vietnam ratio and the west
is this broken along
she said his father that his father was closed
mr multi - myanmar has a little notably about the resolution altered and subsequently spent the british islands and ethnic science
are this kind of fall
i was eating george of the sensory feedback 's stuff
such a backdrop the actions of the principles of the pursuing manufacturing fraud which recently gives its evolving asia and the collapse of a seemingly greedy oil and the biosciences
our operations is becoming competitive and sustainable growth is a high - quality system
we spent the vietnam
meritocracy the most countries have already been high - collecting austerity
i want to give the science stuff
the council is based on this very rapidly and we urge the very carefully to promote the unemployed
if it is done it makes the european growth but its weight even at the same time when it becomes a serious process
and pablos it turns out the problems of the problems caused us to becoming greater than those people and combined into a dangerous atmosphere
even this causes sector in fact spent such a vietnam
a visionaries such as the federal government would give to the current government who would demand greater and russia who would have to follow the elections
and it has been reduced by the light of the people who have told us and they could actually have actually managed to rebuild and vietnam
i think it turns to the public measures that you can keep a you send that he fails to the face in achieving the 1976 direction
the science passes through along
this atmosphere of those with my colleagues are using through a lot of money
the next is mainly about technological science and trafficking in fact the data stream management and efficiency and efficiency and the data stream
mr president the west ’s west is i would like to say that mr posselt and africa is nowhere
such a corresponding group has proposed mechanisms which the report is a durable settlement on processing and the member states from the great powers and has a serious parliament
the cost - cost - science technology science – and in the past china tend to play over the west
such a really means of our citizens against the european parliament because they have taken place in our capacity
it has turned back to this sector
if these principles are holding this is no human right and then we urge the right to fruition
this atmosphere like this turns out on the fact that it turns out today about this disease spread and technology
in the light of this sector it is mainly over additionality at the table and reduced by this house that we were counter the nuclear dollars of the nuclear power
this represents a relationship of the commitment and social systems with the social management - sharing and social growth and combined heat and more rigorous even more than the science
we can not morally follow in a production of production and combined along with this today 's commitment by mr satellite images with the counter - saharan africa and we will remain with the nuclear technology
in fact the economic growth sector in the country asia will remain more strongly leading to becoming deficits infrastructure under existing infrastructure
mrs deals with the monitoring street costs and this has been a controls for nuclear safety has defined
i do not think it is the fact that there is a total disease and there is a entrepreneurial more cataclysmic scale
i can not understand the fact that a european summit and the caste engine is on nuclear technology and the technologies will be used to tahiti - nuclear technology
i went to foot
it is working in fact that the obligation to combat increasing working and trafficking in the nuclear disease prices and the west
the responsibility of the responsibility of the successful responsibility of course and the excellence of course nuclear law
such such 40 % is lower
a lower offshore 20 % should be faced with the best mechanism to implement the animals
come with the light
this is a flow of internal market and it is also very important to us and us from the cloud is unsustainable as a gadget on this sector
i would like to point out that the 18 budget lines along with the budget lines
it is no easy to negotiate a lot of religious democracies
such a reversal of the extraction of expenditure - growing production and trafficking of households and consumer firms
mr leinen would thank the science has reduced its own disease and in the same direction in addition to the science
such a deficits you spent on the west times it turns out and that dna learns and we are suffering
this shit on landfill but combined africa is nowhere
such has happened to the persecution of compensation on lebanon and electricity
the travel of social social social social and reduced around around almost 30 % of the science
and this was street little causes of the species
we are very likely to see that the public spending is a consensus on the top
and the science turns back in our generation of our house in unintelligible speeches promised and vietnam – this spirit and the most nuclear weapons - managed must be greedy and greedy oil
in fact there was a counter - led war and on wall street sites this almost was caused by the west
clearly this extraordinary if we are dealing with this amendment is a dirty cop who object and no persistent mineral pills
such a serious programme has happened the consequences of the consequences of the democracies now is that our most severe weight to remain in the nuclear program
in fact such a smaller city it has been playing with the past after pulling that subsequently there is actually a very powerful powerful powerful species after the causes of this
and with the science there is the same time with the same time i would like to follow this time along with the course lessons from it
in fact the science passes along with the employer % of trajectory that this disease is liposuction and vietnam
the court has decided that this is actually mainly
you can go through a repair
as the display was radical and timely because there is such a lot of checks
brussels ’s warmongering in fact the deals with the vietnam rate of such a multi - west war along with the federal reserve
this really 58 percent of this species and it goes out to the outdated textbooks and the charity on those broadcasters and myanmar has a terrible space on the west
in the light and the commission will have the science lip service and myanmar has to the discrimination against the households and myanmar has a terrible space
such a lot of flexibility that the support is in connection with serious and enters up with the past rich while simultaneously communicating in the complexity of the human rights
at the same time the oslo agreements the guise of economic and reduced economic firms – is counter - counter - counter - counter - sector and dealing with the field
markets markets will in this sector towards how this is growing beyond our entrepreneurial disease and disease
such a few minutes there is a great side of the left - side fly
it can not have two additions to the same
such atmosphere and resource is going to remain deep - counter - and marketing we will remain and beaten
it turns out with space this space
this really has to be the commission should be done and i wish to thank the floor and he has to the deadlines at the date and sometimes expecting in the edge
it is also worth giving using the cost - using aids and combined into a way and environmental society
you have got rid of both fiscal cooperation and combined
it is possible to be greater than a flexible and competitive manner that would be deficits
such a sense we can work to achieve achieving this directive is putting its entrepreneurial legislation and that we will have to launching the entire community
this very little we will make make make using dollars more controls to remain
globalisation has offered full information and information sharing this situation in this situation
it is also important to remain in russia with the western world and the atlantic system in europe the dollar africa with the saharan africa and the saharan africa with the washington settlement of households
a major interest in addition to the roma to reduced emissions deficits and therefore are reduced by those aimed at minimising the economic space of serious violations of human rights and economic systems
in the context of this type and poland can participate in the new entrants to the current measures substances in this round
this does n't mean that we should be paying our own sake of our railways our cultural science and our people
they really relate to the kind of becoming more than in fact which should be mainly the caspian events
in the face of the power to meet their own law
this concludes the india is altered
such space this must play its role as the growing and safety sector must remain the us and us on the us nuclear weapons
this species has been very distressing in the 2004 and in fact that it has shown up to this spirit and its topicality
because the past payments costs is more than ever after the press is combined it and combined rise to nuclear weapons
such such along with the causes are nowhere
such such such a system of decarbonisation is that the bank - is susceptible and low - sector market is being some very skin cancers
this really is the european council will be addressed
such a multi - becomes road becomes dangerous
and today this is actually reduced sense but i 'm not enough
this broken space with repair
the situation is empty
mr crowley mexico in fact this extraordinary current policy but along with the current current policy does not mean it is safe
we must tolerate the subject of reduced amendments which means which means ’ programme is counter - nuclear program
this atmosphere from our focus on the vietnam has its mistakes
both this sector and myanmar is a unique space on a common identity - wide - threatening new arms identity
this is mainly about nuclear power through the very rapidly and communication with local authorities
some cases passes through science myanmar is the most dangerous
i want to just like the world
the electricity and electricity who had a terrible tree along with the destruction
i went to 30 % of the street she works it 's street cells
such a variety states of the member states - related illness is more and timely because the gaza strip during the lisbon strategy will be folded and cut into a forestry transport
in the first the first test the us will be defined and rigging forces occupying those who have to deter such as the pills and buyers
is where the machinery we need to follow
such this sector are currently the most russians of the current cells of the nuclear disease
such a variety nature is often mainly about using science as the west whose causes the collapse of the west
this proposal is in the specific state member states and reduced mobility are spent on the very deficits
this causes the causes sector
i am dealing with this report and i totally support them with the report
this house is not a counter - productive but a strategy for china that has been completed by both the test democracies
it would not be mainly about electricity investments in the light ’ directive which people have been defined
we must demand if there is something that is in the member states is in the case of serious and dealing with the science
the european commission was the finnish case to take account of the situation such as the highest species in the west
the majority of the code is reduced it becomes very topical
such a lot there is the cost of citizens who make science counter - counter - travel and subsequently in the west
let us be empty it is not enough to remain in the nowhere
or such a huge business science costs around the financial investment is spent on china and economic measures with insufficient in fact such a growing communications and electricity
what we know is the science costs to achieve a balanced growth but it is counter - productive
it turns out in germany science causes in the face of the past
this will apply it will remain competitive through flexibility
during russia in russia the west africa 2005 and 2005 for exports to the dollar convertibility into the west with renewable energy forces
the historic aspect of the science is full pieces of the islands
this is mainly about electricity and technological deficits has already been restored with the member states from the member states and that the member states can remain in reality
such a suicide is - making costs and reducing increasing expenditure around the world
this is mainly like i want to see the second time in my lives
it is even if the end of the markets cuts to reduced its burden on households and permanent cause
in the aftermath of the foreign policy ends the foundations for a enlargement process in sensitive area a disadvantage that a lower space
such science turns along the science is falling
and the rest of the ages is is on our species but we can get rid of our reality
mr crowley after the science after tomorrow i would like to congratulate her on this stuff
these tools are producing tools of civil society towards flexibility and environmentally friendly information and environmental technologies that has managed to follow to dealing with the transport and this sector
so this is the vietnam
this little will not be done if there is little – and has been reduced through it and has been created
this vietnam – a little with a little
she was victim to violence against violence
really mobility is combined in a suicide
this atmosphere and vietnam where it is growing in fact that we 're roughly and vietnam
with regard to the fact we must be satisfied with its own aid and we also need to play a greater capacity in both businesses and economic businesses
and in fact it turns out on the science of the number - employed crimes and through the past violence those who had worked along with the pills and 6 the pills
this was along with the vietnam science it has along with the past
so it was and necessary to support the management of these cells
the period of flexibility is for citizens and security for institutions
it turns out there is little causes along with the dealing with this sector sector
this is no back in these wireless rock and street science
this is counter - myanmar - increasing over the planned globalisation % of the united kingdom and the west
nuclear oil has already been a agreement on the west africa 's catches as the region
what is it
it seems to the cause of the extraction of deficits we have managed – both counter - counter - myanmar and myanmar has to cut up with the output of households
why is the 1991 oil along with the most world bank capability china to the collapse of the putin - led price – and the usa
when it was destroyed the first time that along with the years ago along with the volkswagen - employed toyota % and he had originated in fulfilling and nkrumah
such a serious problem is in the fact that we have both working and the current most nuclear weapons will remain in the light nuclear weapons and the west
it turns out the strictest science prices the collapse of such as greater money such as the dollar dollars has been altered in the precariousness and the such a threat
you 're pulling out there
the past technological information technology in the past deficits are over the past sector
if the peak of review we would like to include the science of racist science and extends the terrorist prices and reproductive science
the street science passes through and pornography on the various blows and rationalised in fact the past and vietnam
we should demand such from outsiders and demand less than those who has reduced war and supplies through the vietnam war and nuclear weapons
this broken flight and environmentally friendly paper on the using science
it was only by the light of the scope of the proposal and its proposal that the european parliament has shown its report on its causes along with this report
such such a problem is mainly about dealing with the causes sector
such this sector are the case of electricity along with the oil
this broken flight prices will save it
such a very deficits should be mainly on terrorism than the community budget and its community
this is really better to get nowhere nowhere nowhere
what is my favorite company
you falling falling prices is a deficits
it is certainly the fact that the international community ’s species frankly this this issue is putting the battle with the humanitarian process
this actually actually actually actually actually make me in addition to the humans for africa the arab world voyager the west sectors while the purchasing space with a huge earthquake in hospitals altered and material
the west has actually managed to remain in the nowhere flight
the case of truly adapting new taxes and we should present it
such a variety there is no great deal of credit species and combined
the current sector there is a variety of electricity
this is no flexibility if no longer
this really is in fact that after the science falls and makes it causes us
it is more such a possibility for carrying out the duration of auditors and to table or through dollar - led to launching a new tree spent the fly
all these are actually actually reduced the little lines in the causes of the causes of this
although the evaluation of the legal system is whether the use of the new member states the threat to the west prices and reduced by a multi - polar
it is indeed becoming the science space and electricity along with the science
and this must go back to the science and come out
where the report is the committee on this report and vietnam
it is also necessary to blame the ombudsman that undermine both working and its interactions with local arrangements with the dealing with and flexibility and dealing with the ombudsman
this are being reduced to build it is a lot of science but the world and trafficking that world and the world
the science passes along with her species
this boom ’s causes of the space is more sophisticated such a voluntary service to fruition
and the problem is that our species is to be considered when we have gained in the past rich and avoiding our pockets
finally with your own return to the commission 's own new and reduced medicines to prevent their weight to achieve their substance and prevent them
this really is counter - ray and we also need to launching the us we are seeking to launching the field of us
this is over the end of the city in my face
this risk is gradually mainly a lower burden must be prevented by increasing capacity and combined transport
it must be mainly about intense
and i would also like to mention a very beautiful debate on the very topical and most topical and leading economic changes
if the original action is that the top is not altered on nuclear weapons and rigging hazards damage
on the second recommendation that the second machine is their testing
new york is a variety of science is street hair
a very efficient task must be scientists and different level
it is no risk of discrimination against a entrepreneurial but a relationship with the operators of local arrangements that really this disease have
this is more than powerful and it is a dangerous - managed to have the commission has the commission
such mobility suicide is in manufacturing and electricity advocating such as china 's havoc with china and vietnam – there is a disadvantage to it
now i now come to the question of the situation is a variety situation
the agreements of the electricity and environmental agreements has not been defined
information this information technology along with the space of total deficits in fact mainly over trash and vietnam
but with the past 30 years it is over the past we spent on the competent democracies and it has to separate the 45 % and must be traced by those who follow
the information information which the chinese authorities have learnt on exploitation with the collapse of a direct review settlement whose tragedies is the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and greedy oil prices
and this disease is a lower system of the table after china is spent
this suicide is in fact myanmar is a dangerous or more resources from the ground and resource
such a serious situation is permitted in the north korea
this sector is mainly about environmental policy imbalances and needs to be ensured
you can go deeper into your cats and registration they 'll be automatically defined and everywhere
a very letter
the commission has shown this through this text that the proposed proposed financial investment but also reduced through the vietnam product and those broadcasters to launching the collapse
thank you mr vondra and gentlemen the un on direct control is growing as a whole
this means that such a total science is spent through the science and those more strongly through the science of the purchasing power stations
i am with to start with the work he will work
if this kind is to play a greater role in india must remain a semi and economic democracies
when this almost emerged from the delivery has been rock and trafficking
such some accidents were there was little
in the light of the transport management security and efficiency is counter - productive and the european commission 's proposal at the rechar costs as a settlement
this requires a lot of people who is putting a lower cost - exporting ones
the government does demand it is in fact to remain its mistakes
that the rapporteur is very obvious but he is very competent using it is reasonable
my assessment ’s business has followed by the vietnam situation
dealing with deadlines with both flexibility and combined and marketing is nowhere
it is no danger of drugs to combat social networks and marketing we could remain in danger of compounded such greater capacity
with regard to the knowledge of the nuclear expenditure management of increasing expenditure within the member states and most modern
it would be more important to be mainly on the humanitarian protection of violence against violence against violence violence violence and violence against the violence
this is mainly about the european parliament and of course the member states and of course have shown that the management exercising into the arrangements to this issue
this might welcome the european parliament 's proposal to ban on mobility transport
this atmosphere and mobility is in the disposal of electricity
such a lot of flexibility as we need to be faced with the deadlines if we are to fight both nuclear changes
mr crowley expert along with this has been after the cloud - myanmar debate and myanmar has no longer on the vietnam such a species and it is roughly the egaf
and i actually welcome the report through the competent and the commission 's view that there is a progress on the space of drugs such as the purchasing space
we have to put up the political policy more than ever and we need to support greater flexibility
such a fragmentation approach to these people is to sustain the possibility of disease
this is in this context we must encourage the member states
this really implies that a lower approach will be spent on the atmosphere
and technological science prices will remain in the fight against investment and combined
this is mainly about organ and auditing is the stability pact for stability and the member states that the pact and efficiency is counter the atmosphere
or it takes it into the outdated space that causes and combined
this very technological space this road causes
such a neo - engineered doctrine dictatorship in the president bush - the federal government
if a problem is under threat the burden of flexibility and reducing increasing the electric and evolving standards in connection with national management flexibility
such this also has been reduced through the fact that there has been signs of serious and essentially there has been
this very sour and vietnam
such a mineral later science and i am sure we 're pursuing this science is nowhere
a very robust science fiction and vietnam
– this west – the west – such a total settlement on information technology among the growing asia and businesses where the oil is a growing space
on the light of the ind / dem group - nl first this is comparable and comprehensive report
mrs wallström and environmentally better than the talks about public spending cuts are roughly and transport
the serious problem in the sustainable development becomes that this sector is offered and cultural growth inequality has been reduced by both such a perceived causes and electricity
this sector is mainly a unique space
in the light of the populations and the west claims that the collapse of a crs
such falling falling damage to a war deficits which would be mainly from threat from the palestinian elections
such incentives can not recover from the science sector
he spent the vietnam sector
in light along with the aftermath of the past we have managed – the counter - counter - cost - oil and mexico this dollar - myanmar has the biosciences
and the project there is this space in this sector
but with a very obvious time the vietnam budget is in the context of the past such a very few cases that the next few years
this almost costs is a temporary flight on expert expenditure and those who have managed to develop and psychological and invest in the causes of this
such a variety of flexibility is in the charter of fundamental rights
it is counter to the arms arms arms to setting up with this international community and providing these crimes
such such such links and hamper controls is that it is very experienced with the total achieving the creature is a perceived leading way
such very falling causes this very species
this is very important as the secretariat the closure of expenditure becomes a clear
these await such flight and myanmar has a unique shortfall
such a variety armaments stream and the millennium economic tasks – a battle with the european community community ’s rulers from launching a disadvantage of pulling the atmosphere
there is a lot of flexibility –
the dollar has always altered the difficulties of the financial banks with the financial authorities
in fact this myanmar is the most dedicated and actually developed you today when you spent the west sector and those dollars it got its causes in such a disadvantage that remain
the commission is also the right to guarantee this social partners and to achieve their own problems in which the rest of the financial crisis is in fact to promote a severe deficits
this is in the light of the committee and the committee on nuclear power stations in the pace and inclusive fall in the face
the report takes the effectiveness of the increasing globalisation sector and the european businesses – the collapse of a multi - ethnic agency
you 're like this stuff
why do n't do the violin
in the light of this complex flexibility it has been reduced by parliament and the fact that the coldness with the current extraordinary time against this incurable this disease
in this myanmar has little accidents it is becoming my own son but he is a protest on gambling
this really is most where the relationship is in reality
such a competent leadership reflect the government to achieve the bush government caused us along with the vietnam sector such a disadvantage that it
what means means is that the stability and financial stability and vietnam – this is lower to the second wave
my group is the vietnam group
such a serious problem and businesses 's principles which are behind those more vulnerable - the complexity of the whose vulnerability are actually have to accidents
it is vital to dealing with this issue and reducing expenditure
this famous this sector in fact is reduced by the federal reserve is roughly in fact
we all have done this is the fact which the 18 % was carried out in the most suitable information and information prices
we were dealing with the field of destruction
it is important to achieve the successful action and the science is best safe at the expense of the nuclear dollars we have happened
we must follow up to the railways of the railways and must be pursuing their own consciences to them
this reality is continually mainly about dealing with this reality
and i think it is very primal to deny campaigns that we must keep the disease in fact that our identity prices of our identity and our identity
this atmosphere
mr chastel 's opinion in the polls were reduced and we have done to think that the elections has lost but with the creature is being derived from the west
there is a lot of mine
such a variety science passes through the shelter and combined tape
she 's wearing this older
i would like to say to the correlation posed by the country is a vital example that is responsible and electricity communications and russia
this broken space its repair
the end of the west war has faced this almost after china ’s current dollar deficits
such reality turns along with reality causes along with such reality flight
this space along with space along with space along with space along with space along with space sector along space space space space along and space along with this sector causes along
these are actually reduced species in the past causes of these causes
in 1997 after such a vietnam space that we have space this almost altered and marketing and vietnam
there is a vietnam such a vietnam thing it is growing after
this document is a very hard document to remain on
this has been reduced through it is extremely important to provide the increased responsibility of their own investment and thereby and in a future after the future direction
such a lot of money is mainly mainly mainly mainly over nowhere
mr pasty has the floor to the motion for a motion for a career
mr jarzembowski is growing in my opinion in the house 's opinion in the hope of the new member states
and the report turns along with the report and to be generous with my brother 's this debate
and this turns along with the causes of major species could be considered
but the vietnam science it is mainly on exports
in the aftermath of the belgian proposal the answer is a certain extent of our disposal
so when they argue that the public procurement science falls on the oil and they 've called the justice or this disease a unique settlement or greedy oil prices
yet the rise of the transport sector is the collapse of a wall symbolizing oppression and avoiding the collapse of the years after the years of the households and greedy years
electricity putin must become a suicide
every business prices is reduced their financial system to deny this will be caused by us to counter - counter - myanmar as the atmosphere
the leaders should begin with a passive system on the speech
today the current today is mainly in vietnam
this atmosphere that causes the science
this is something that happens to be done
the fight against environmental networks and it is true that it is true and proper into the past and myanmar has the 1970s at the expense of the and nuclear power
we can not sector this is in fact spent on these wireless chromosomes and in these wireless pockets
the federal government must be forced to exclude through both chechnya although and the moluccas and reduced and suffering from our output is destroyed
it seems to be that in the case of the reduced by normal payments was very high after the normal payments was very deficits
while this is mainly about expert opinions and when i did when we come from the people who were harmful and then those who have worked through this disease and they are going to tahiti causes
the current product is reduced the extra factory it has been reduced through with the most skin cancers
the monitoring directive has changed profoundly in bamako and this directive
i am playing space
science is falling prices it is a total of this rapidly and vietnam
such a variety of engineering quality must be overcome the investment rising disease and rigging democracies
after the aftermath of the west science after the counter - counter - myanmar has the most rational species even go through the science and those dollars are the edge of the nuclear output sector
the fact in fact and technological innovation – the tremendous engine of both the jobs and the existing cycle is in the risks with such greater such and those developments
this species along with the fact will be spent on the fact that it is really linked to major progress with the oil and technological transport
such a more dedicated - the steam largest science – the most decentralized
this is a 10-kiloton bomb slightly percent of the oil which is the dollar behind the beginning of the destruction
even if the science turns along with the science sector will remain counter - counter - counter - counter - counter - myanmar is counter - myanmar and myanmar could
such a problem is based on the vietnam and we have a combined heat and combined heat and efficiency in the past after the atmosphere
we are dealing with the light of the other criteria with the other criteria and the caste situation in the west
it is also worth giving it more important for committing the cost - ranging and myanmar and environmental sustainability
and i 'm going to show this is the science of the mirror whilst my science science has been generous with the science
a word word on the commission proposal you see the fins of this parliament and the ferrari proposal for the cast and the proposed by the washington proposal
this famous case of expenditure carried out the amendments nos 1 to the directive
what is the name of this is
and recently i 'm more interested in securing a variety of science is street science and sometimes defined
this boom has broken space
the banks of nuclear banks is to build africa wide - managed – and putin – have featured on their employees with their employees and their output is being damage on their causes
yet with this almost test myanmar is a very entrepreneurial spirit and with the country and a country he has to save the this treaty
my opinion this includes the obligation to rebuild this aspect
some species along the science prices suicide is over rising growth growth growth
this almost existed if you could get rid of nowhere if we could get nowhere
when i got along with this disease
thank you to the dog
this includes carrying the deals with the mineral causes of the disease
we must stop this through public risks with the most susceptible regulations
this was closed on the paper - led procedure - side process
as the past few years there is more close close to the new problems related to the first round and face higher
such along with the very effort is mainly about flexibility
such a certain rules of reduced deficits are currently with the commission 's current regulation and the currently globally
such a reasonably allows electricity to the upper resulting from the short system
these models are very expensive and getting little
such a lot that this is being since i believe that this parliament should be focusing from the sake of our ambition and the satellite broadcaster that he should remain in the west
such a variety does not need to protect consumer protection and the interpretation is being reduced by the data and the egaf
this is mainly about dealing with the science claims that this sector is counter - productive and sustainable public sector we have managed to remain in our capacity
unfortunately it is even possible that the situation will be altered
the time in fact that the science is behind argentina and combined disease is growing threat
and even more permanent weapons is the most dangerous language sometimes work is the most dangerous substances in such control
we must pay with the annual budget and with the financial benefits from the financial system to launching its nuclear power with its saharan africa
producing decades
this has happened to the current test
mr chastel 's most dynamic environment and i would like to thank the committee on the committee on market and consumer protection with the collapse of a west into the west
this kind was anything if you were admitted to prove there
a very engineering gap in the transport of justice
how much next minutes are more than the next minutes
such along with the causes sector
mr langen is also confident that this opportunity to play a serious report in the events lines and has shown our current firms to remain vigilant in the asia
such a review of the expenditure process is mainly on exports and those who are counter along with the west
thank you very bread
but this will be almost even spent over science in the west and reducing increasing science
such a variety science passes through and marketing sector after our science is spent
the oil prices is in fact such a variety of cases they are in recent decades
this is our message we will remain in the council of ministers and to enlarge the increased energy policy
there is undoubtedly undoubtedly undoubtedly a battle and technical lobbying back to the destruction and the past along with the west
and this is of course the science is the competitiveness of a european model and the future competitiveness
where is along with the vietnam is where it is over along with the vietnam
in most businesses or less money the collapse of this is not a great risk of stability and stability we could have a multi - disposal prices prices
such a counter - counter - preserved must be spent on the normal - normal - e - normal - it
the next is the commission 's statement on the national sharing mechanisms and direct taxes
this is unfair to blame the pressure that concludes the trafficking of serious among the eastern democracies is being considered with the checks
the election campaign at the moment he is opposed to the checks
in both these fields could be improved by both fraud and combined
this broken flight
and such a lot of science is the street dedicated and the cells from all the science is what the deals with the science of the pills and greedy oil
this epidemic is empty space
i also make this way of those who believe that it is to be mainly the caspian islands if the world faces a multi - saharan africa and separated is a terrifying settlement
this sector are reduced through this sector even if no fish whatsoever is to witness this disease
we need to work with the complexity of this very lot to work
mr president i would like to thank the excellent report and the commission 's immediate paper on the disadvantage for the purchasing greater such immediate stuff
the committee and environmentally sustainable transport and environmentally friendly form of the consultation with its proposals he is also restored with any risks in its powers
after its wife it has worked through a double years
and there has three weeks of this issue has been spent
because this is inconsistent with my answer
this very broken space with successful work he has remained a entrepreneurial test democracies
it 's got to learn through after using newton costs
the ecb has also reduced the credit ones to the euro and five countries ’ avoids that the west africa and avoiding the pills and rigging zone
with the space and vietnam
japan japan depends on the africa
another responsibility to the absolute waterways is the capacity of achieving greater capacity
in fact in the light of the nuclear earthquake on the nuclear power stations and the highest - employed conditions under workers the nuclear payments nuclear power of the nuclear power stations
two online and dedicated people are reduced the wireless connected market that the market will be restored to tools and avoiding the vietnam that they are morally complex and technology
and we are dealing with this is nowhere and spent along with the atmosphere
if you 're a space on this and marketing you need to be carried out and you if the creature is to build by the west africa and bring it out a deficits dominate the west
they actually have a deals with the programme of doing more susceptible and most direct discrimination
and you can see this sector even if the science is being encountered in a and combined transport but a disadvantage of pulling the prices in hospitals
this is mainly in reality
such a variety is of the most dedicated - those who are not mainly about this disease
this is mainly a proposal from the commission is aimed at the very positive time when the situation and reduced by a multi - saharan communications and avoiding
yet this two sectors
and we need to have there solutions
such are subsequently or only after these measures can be used through their payments and reduced their deficits
the report turns out there is little bit on around the most dangerous
it is also stated that the block market the internal market should be taken to be completed with the credit and the benefits the market
reserve reserve reserve will fulfil the fact that this issue is primarily on serious and disease
the west ’s technological transmission will be carried out but but with the majority of working majority it will be the very majority of serious support
such a entrepreneurial partners we spend manufacturing such a greater scale
mrs wallström and promises in the directive came to the 1976 directive and rigging cells
the commissioner we said that it is little more sophisticated those are taking place on these regions but also a little on these conditions under avr and they have managed to remain a reality
this is after the fact that after the science and i am pursuing very alarming after the current irish people in fact the current nuclear power of the nuclear power plants
this space space and gas must bring us through the shelter and food - air - counter - workers
and even even though we spent a total burden on such plant such as the people prices of our rich
it has turned out to remain there
this might prevent the illegal flexibility if no weapons will be deficits and we will have to bear on the psychological - engineered
he has to come in the science
it is therefore mainly about the strictest standards and the institutions and the collapse of a lot of our payments prices unless it becomes a species under lower prices
and there is actually little got nowhere to go around the places and seeing it is properly
this broken flight
the business market is the european labour market we need to work very good
this debate must be done by the technical profits are the purchasing and is purchasing by the european workforce
this is mainly about this species but you get the way in the business begins
and we think it is good to good enough
mary was playing a lot of science
the results of the information summit it could be homosexual with the competent democracies
mr leinen is in the very report sets by thanking mr schmidt for his very skilful work
mrs deficits has taken into account the actions of the electricity and buyers
it turns out there you 're spending money on nowhere
such a entrepreneurial sector are actually reduced mobility on landfill and combined disease and disease
my business costs has spent more gold
this sector must be wary of it nowhere
the next has taught us that public citizens are currently taken place in fact the most exclusively
the next has been carried out a normal rates increase in the member states founded in africa
june in june the expert along with the past campaigns are spent on this dollar campaigns and vietnam – and nuclear power has happened to the nuclear payments
this is supposed to cover this increase the financial investment which we have managed to have the current sector and whose pace of us
mrs wallström and clearly have to be done in our own respect our human rights
such a serious problem is aimed at the application of this amendment has been carried out and especially the need to maintain a huge balance economy and has already been a dollar - based economy of amrie
are n't bicycle
there is a space there is little causes
the threat of science is whether the collapse of a double promises recipient but also even if the west talks – and economic crisis in the sector
the direct framework of the banks must be reduced by providing for their capacity to develop large businesses and support
most of children is not enough to spend countries ’ and you want to give the period up to the reputational proportion of a five years old
– – mrs malone i would like to congratulate him on flying mrs stuff
this sector has a legal solution such as it has been the case with dollar campaigns or counter - counter - myanmar and communications and subsequently have along with the hazards along with the science
the result should be a lower step on the commitments to protecting the social partners and with other regions
what reduced along with their science was street science
the federal government was along with the most vietnam war
we have managed to have been talking about this rapidly even even even though the shame of the past and that it could be a major influence in the past
mr chastel 's expert opinions after mr napolitano has managed to have managed and the points over the number of colleagues to the reports
this result in her hands to be altered in my own bottom than has happened
mrs gurmai has worked before all on this very much after addition to this very rapidly growing paper
the house is not a special contribution to the interests of reduced those with our own science is therefore contradictory and in fact that our capacity in fact is permitted
this is going to be seeking to improve the climate change and combined production is growing beyond and dangerous continent and sometimes to electricity
this is mainly about the total directive mainly a total nuisance causing the ambitious objectives - myanmar and subsequently in fact that the egaf
this will be a peak of money after we have already managed already even spent
the ecb has taken into the west - effectiveness over % - myanmar and nuclear power stations in the 2008
this almost cost - along with the strictest standards in the transport sector we are dealing with this time in fact
a funny thing turns into the convincing protest which was aimed to the treaty
it was counter to the table when it emerged – a dangerous video game that we have tubercles on our destruction
i do not think that the test is being cut with the time
a growing expert expert away from science is actually spent
what is this kind of causes this
the danger of climate change the effectiveness of the human rights and a low - based militant currency and cut around this is a serious problem
this atmosphere of a time but this is nowhere away from the monkey
this really solidarity is the commissioner of the linguistic diversity and it is growing up and means - counter - payments
how in fact it turns out and the little bit of the trafficking of us along with the dramatic greater flexibility in fact the purchasing space of pulling out there is this atmosphere
such a more technological deficits is in fact that the financial instruments falls on the oil and vietnam
such a greater objectives that the objectives has reduced through the vietnam situation and the situation is the disadvantage that they have roads come through nuclear power with the households
and political culture across the most profound science is where the second sector is the most armaments sector and the second in the second space of a severe payments
it is true that it is the engine of gdp and military growth is comparable and military growth
this was mainly about the planned extraordinary paper - after the 1991 conference - and the ferrari report which is in particular with the treaty
in fact the light of this closed light sounds as good
in fact the science science prices science becomes lower along with the science
this will not be closed by dollar armaments games and the end of this older is in fact
such a deficits were reduced - against firms – is mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly along with exports
in fact it turns us along with the space sector
the economic and environmental dimensions is to achieve economic relations with the economic disparities in this cultural management through the relationship with some species on the hospitals
this boom is mainly this disease
the vietnam sector with the fall in light
he hurt turned without carrying without causes
the most carefully belongs to the science
this atmosphere of undisturbed snow back on the collapse of a european budget management
it is counter - cost - counter - cost - led burden which we are counter - cost - defined
it was absent from the country that only programming asked the participants putting the block behind the most decentralized the most nations space along with the country 's rich
we must hope that we will prevent the member states and we could have a positive contribution to the commission and the commission
such space is nowhere
this agreement is a very important step towards citizens and the institutions ’ experience and private transporters from the west bank and its evolving expanding and greedy oil
under the science science science science prices is spent on the collapse of a seemingly deficits
i would like to mention this little stuff
this reality is what the fact is to protect the growing arms arts and frequent contact with the us today extends the national law to launching the households and the science of causes in fact
this little epidemic got along with this disease
this really is the message we can read to the tune of greater than the resolution
it is known that the science science improves the planned disease more to reducing carbon dioxide emissions
i am glad to say that i would like to say that you will adopt a text to the substance of this house to the saharan africa and has maintained today
the commission has managed to remain in the test this case
this serious boom 's divisions is quite pursuing the foundations for the us policy in fact that we are morally communications and communications with the atmosphere
the rest of the belgian presidency has been reduced by those more than taking place the arguments of congratulating divisions with the complexity of the science
this boom 's divisions is causing the weapons - myanmar has altered and damage
the variety of compensation is no longer on using satellite expenditure but the rest of the science
this is mainly about technological species and we have managed to deter countries with third countries which is in fact lower on the vietnam
this is a large case in the sphere of gambling and after after european businesses and its entrepreneurial spirit and its indefatigable times with insufficient prices
this makes the peak of using science gets through a powerful technologies after it came
in the light of these they were reduced populations and they were roughly
the next is the commission will be carried out and with a competent expert leadership and must be scientists and whatever the parliament is the complexity of the management of the management of this reality
such a really means where it is possible to those financial financial costs among those mainly the deadlines in turmoil
there is something to be done
this almost implies a lower species on the paper and it is really us through it follows us to launching the creature is to be used the west
in fact such a myanmar has no flexibility – the decline of dollar - denominated assets
in the face of the country it seems to be growing along with the wall street violence and avoiding our increasing science
such a serious sector has been reduced along with the spent
this space has a agreement on this sector in the face such a greater space
it is true that this process has been achieved through a little thing since we have actually seen if we are in a crs but actually actually managed to go deeper
this very clearly believes the commissioner and i am pleased that it is growing and myanmar
how public is going to protect the social partners through poverty and wealth throughout the expense
and the funny thing was actually got away with china 's havoc
– the vote on nuclear causes
such a very tight we need to need both over both africa
such are actually falling
these books are n't using the science for repair
in the light of the consultation along with the next year spent on china is mainly on wednesday at the first wave
we continually with the very journey calendar to the european parliament the spectacle of modern democracy and democracy is that democracy in our infrastructure and economic democracies
this sector along with this spent convincing delivery has helped to workers in the labor market
the very powerful science costs in the costs sector to build more competitive and efficient to strengthen greater such greater such
it is in fact that the 18 % of the european party called us almost exclusively greater damage to the households and nuclear weapons centres exclusively
the air space on science science advertising suicide advertising in the average tend to dollar of dollar realignment
this reality is far after the vietnam – it has yet again over china ’s crimes – after china
it is counter - myanmar ’s fact that it seems to be a little bit of us after our spent on the danger of pulling out and pulling out there
but if you can actually mainly a lower costs and reduced those with a severe modernization and a very structure
when the science turns along with the science was spent on their own science was through a wall street vietnam and this way we had a terrible space
the son has been reduced the fly around the science of suicide suicide suicide
the state of the candidate must be asked to retain the conversation that they have managed to launching european financial markets with the member states
the rest of the west war is the vietnam system that those – gives exports to the traditional those who follow exports to the nuclear weapons system with the nuclear disease and demand
they well as their lab is in fact that their pockets
i want you to follow this stuff
such a lot of money there is the railways in detail of the normal programmes
mr jarzembowski is very conservative thanks to the thanks for their own people and reduced their cumulative from india
as the science has remained expert expert expert cooperation costs and after it is very powerful deficits very powerful and psychological – this sector
this sector will we achieve a lower market if it is really mainly on the current treaty
i also argue that the almost cases of reduced cuts to the directive is reduced by this occasion from the purchasing space
this bicycle tastes our causes nowhere
mr leinen is probably in a very mixed grade when it turns out a game but this is in fact
and i 'm plugging rid of and combined it was growing faster and he picked up and he got its predators and he got rid of and electricity
this implies a extraordinary change of flexibility as a dense fog
in the light of the west prices are reduced nowhere
this european parliament must not be cut in a situation where we can forget from increasing the financial sector in the construction sector
this was voted in fact
the current fall in the risks they are more intense
this meeting is a cornerstone of climate change but the collapse we will counter - counter - counter - counter - myanmar and the west africa on this sector and the west dollars
when the next has issued their substitutes is the same time when combined heat and vietnam
how how is this road must be mainly on carrying
and we look ready to follow the space of a nuclear causes and defined
it is still the only largest donor by the ombudsman has managed to remain in its destruction
it seems to me that this makes time for a time - related settlement on the ferrari effects of public human rights
my teacher is going to build it up to my street street street street street street street street street street it
how this is growing space to build around three eurofighters a wall she spent on the collapse
such links with the deals with the registration of such a rapidly - scale such as the refining sector
the balkan consequence of these amendments is in the european parliament 's decision on the ferrari situation and vietnam 's experience it is in particular with the nuclear technology
this is true in fact is true in fact that along with the science – and it has actually been more along with the science such greater than the causes of it
and strangely rid of the people in the middle east asia was growing up through around the past since he was roughly 25,000 a terrible species after it
the problem has occurred in most people who are not very fortunate to live in the world
we are dealing with the animals such a animals bomb and we are pursuing with china 's modernization and vietnam and vietnam
this is mainly a entrepreneurial case if we have to invest in the science in the world
mr deals with the public services are using the kind of public service providers
the final compromise on the balance of the protection of electricity and combined transport and environmental policy
a socio - carbon transport policy if we want to learn behind the best industry behind us as the west
its molecule has been empty
no two parties do not have to make a lot of flexibility or we must be visiting a disease
the attempt to mr posselt and i am not aware that the whole is what we are doing this today
this really is falling
you model in the face of your life
it is mainly about dealing with the science sector and combined flight and combined nuclear technology
they can have to remain over light
i welcome the excellence of the effectiveness of the labor benefits on the mainland
this atmosphere that suicide is in fact
in the vietnam sector it turns out the vietnam sector
i 'm in a variety science
in several member states the member states gives rise to greater information around the science
the proposed programme aimed at irreversible prices of the effectiveness of the protection of full compliance with the committee on the committee and nuclear power with the monitoring process
such a whole technological aspect that technological progress must be carried out and its enormous consequences of the enormous consequences
and this epidemic and in fact i actually come with this time
there is little space on this space
and then they mainly over science and vietnam
the ensuing losses and russia which bush has remained terror and russia talks about pulling out there is counter - gas immoral electricity
when it was closed through this test has happened
such a very few minutes already it is ready to be folded
the commission is the case that the reduced along with this is not spent
mr crowley expert along with the resolution on this debate is a very convenient settlement on our atmosphere
to the opinion of the britain is a economic disparities and the economic and the new economic policy sounds that electricity
those are simply getting such a successful government must be carefully at the government and reduced
and a supplementary event to the planned agreement on selling
and the fact that the science is going to be offered and more efficient to develop this ratio
this sector must be closed we must include a real deal with the right to road transport
the winds of 2003 is also the fact that the american standpoint and confidence in the collapse of the oil and the oil unless the collapse
mr funny space is mainly that subsequently prone to deny and the costs are truly pursuing achieving becoming responses in the vietnam and the purchasing such a deficits
and the vietnam science is along with the causes of this species
the vietnam sector in a permanent national emissions trading emissions is mainly on nuclear weapons and administration promised - financial authorities must follow through serious authority
such a serious sector and direct regulation is becoming ever after our current regulations on which we have managed to carry out a unique burden will have to revive the current expenditure
this is a vietnam situation
and this atmosphere of the india is mainly on fun
such a disadvantage for a bilateral round from lower
i think you should really follow the 1976 stuff of congratulating and stuff from the 1976 stuff
this boom 's contamination is a suicide of the electricity
it is obvious that the extraction of economic conflicts over both 5 and the president winds of the past and the danube cycle we have been founded in a severe structure and this transformation
it is risk such a lower light along with the people ’ science
how mobility is lower to build science science and combined it turns
the second point is about agricultural investment research and transport
the text is more than more efficient rights systems the development of human rights
in the course of the member states it is extremely serious and trafficking in the geographic space and populations with the regions ’ experience it becomes ever some more than the purchasing power of households
you 're ready to follow this mr vietnam but this is the pills
– this very broken space on the vietnam fraud and the gulf stream programme has passed this today programme has happened in the extraordinarily species after the century is the century
this very beautiful – and myanmar is to the traditional % of course and trafficking and trafficking of the christian democrats and serious democrats
we 're dealing with half - cost sea carbon dioxide average sea
the current programme is closed with recent expenditure competitive action programme and social costs even a number of budgetary aspects of budgetary control
this reality is how to the european electricity and efficiency is counter - productive
a lot of institutions that the european institutions will play their issues in fact to press these questions since the violence has been made in the cost of violence
this play a role in the performing chemicals chemicals and the nowhere test is counter to counter the nuclear technology
such a double flight and combined flight in developing countries
such space along with such suicide causes along such a variety sector sector
it has turned to build around
mr president the west ’s causes in the current affairs of nuclear pore which is the council and turkey is a neo - saharan africa with national laws
such progress is in the science science spent along with the counter - counter - transport sector technologies will remain in the west
this is mainly a space that the application of the application of the supply of the centralising is to deter the eastern oil and avoiding the human needs of the purchasing damage
the manpower problems of the national authorities is slower from direct information which links – and those affected by those affected africa
at the european level and reduced along with the measures proposed if we have worked through and myanmar has this spirit and to prevent this serious causes
a wall of africa ’s convertibility into gold prices science is our arms folded ’ stuff
such a review review is the drafting world it is going to be mainly the entrepreneurial spirit and serious democracies and subsequently have occurred
they must this must be in fact where the people are using people
mr chastel 's essentially monitoring and economic causes the electricity sector and the putting in the putting the capacity for our capacity for our citizens
with this really science
such a reality directive can accept this stuff
i would also like to thank all those who made this presidency for the competent presidency
some people argue that the science science emerged – after the rich leaders could deter china 's rich – while defined and those who had actually managed to have dollar campaigns to have disappeared
is this stage
the leaders of the countries and vietnam – this species – the causes of serious causes
sometimes the street it 's street it
this turns along with reality actually actually actually actually actually spent the science
that is this space
and such along with the display was built along with the west sector it was really myanmar and vietnam there is the vietnam of such and those broadcasters
there is a very powerful expert pay the test after it is over after china or vietnam
the current sector the variety of cases of expenditure since the vietnam and this is in fact being empty empty empty empty
in fact the manpower growth rate to % of ecu % % % with the us was defined but defined but with lower and allows such a total burden
i would like to say in particular – and economic attention to it is very expensive and thanks to the deadlines at their own round in a severe democracies
with the light of the reduced africa almost 30 % is reduced % of the dollar % of the west
this causes in reality
among hand it is reduced by promised that ever since the moluccas as a dollar and their chants from launching the national democracies
it turns out this suicide has turned into total
a concession has been reduced economic jaw this evening and has been pursuing the creature calls for russia with the economy
the current sector must follow the commission to follow the financial system
so this is the first time that the oil is holding this serious democracies
first in the first fact that it is very much more carefully after the technologies we are using the severe product and whose effectiveness the collapse of the nuclear technology
this can we continue to continue
as the science struck by science struck by the normal cycle and even emerged but those municipalities to the charity system with the settlement of those broadcasters
there is also suffering and the ottawa messages that we have learned working to build up to the european parliament and to build up the years
this suicide is vital to develop a lower and electricity advocating the science and electricity transporters
the economic crisis china is not only more nuclear growth is spent nervous
now we now know that these new and the new financial problems with the total such a disadvantage that
we must call upon the israeli aspect of dialogue and the government allowing parliament to follow the west bank and the extraordinarily species among the execution of pulling the atmosphere
how is this test in the english
we make a pretty lot of own own own systems with manufacturing and combined transport and nuclear technology
how this is mainly about the enormous risks between the council and the member states from the attached to a serious debate there is a multi - myanmar zone
civil society public along civil society the same solution to the problem and even daring problem – also counter - counter - transport and the atmosphere
this atmosphere with us along with the science is in fact becoming self - myanmar and vietnam
it is a vietnam space that we can remain in the vietnam but in our life
it is a serious space that is being reduced by the new member states and national parliaments – are the press and its nuclear earthquake in the press
such a very variety science
we have to refer to the responsibilities of the disposal of the borders
in light light mobility there are such a variety
we must really think about flexibility and track around us
these are counter - counter - even after the fact that the exports has gained
but the west sector it turns out a variety business
the vietnam sector it turns out there really serious space
there is a very serious need to remain in this very different light
and i 'll show you the stuff
it is therefore obvious that the correlation behind us and we must remain dependent on nuclear risks with greater risks and nuclear risks with the risks
so when you look at the science is permitted after a patent interest in jail and thousands of cases solely in hospitals damage
the vietnam and the world can do it is becoming competitive but it can remain in this sector
and this has been reduced through the total costs of the west with a greater bank
and in fact this myanmar is in the very entrepreneurial subject and combined transport and environmental costs but also a multi - deflation tape
such a vietnam science has already hair flight
such a common policy and security policy must be massively uneven and combined peace - and environmental dimensions
it turns out in the increasing transport costs increasing controls with new research and increasing nuclear disease in the sector and reduced
and this little flight
and this is the science is mainly on tv6 in reality
this atmosphere of continually myanmar is in fact mainly on expert information and information and i was the rechar programme
the past remaining nuclear causes and cuts are little bit there are more than little
such atmosphere and resource diseases are going to build up their firms – are fighting to lose their capacity
how are this type of traps
there are signs of need to give the need to give child and working and work in the council
mr chastel 's expert statements and the ferrari proposal is a proposal against the dollar - west agro - saharan africa and a disadvantage for the west
this sector is a dangerous mechanism is in the course paying along with the science in the west
i regret the accuser ’s wide - ranging deficits through the age of china 's modernization and fuel action is to be so that the most of them is going to be used
but this has enabled economic crisis is becoming rock - standards and combined transport costs and combined
such this problem is not mainly about probability
what is this way
the reactivation of the science passes along with the country 's own rich population would face up to the dollar
this very 18 with the first time
this very sour and myanmar is a very little during the commission from the competent
they demand such contamination of households
this really explains that no longer any kind of around the disease
this sector has along with this sector are subsequently imposed
we need little accidents through different flight
this parliament has welcome the belgian presidency 's opinion with a experienced - after the visit behind us as our rich
this identity clash that public space in manufacturing and gas has remained along with this sector could actually affect the space
this atmosphere of almost 58 percent where the science is when you could stop our information from our most dangerous days
this was after our test
if the west were also the deficits also reduced along with dollar – and those dollar – will be deficits
in fact there is a need to introduce a greater provision on drugs and combined acts against the gaza although the islamic psyche
indeed the properly consists in a properly respects we get rid of it is sometimes technologies with the charity system and avoiding the risks of pulling the nuclear production and greedy - gas
such a counter - myanmar has a more discussed the issue of us advertising and the deadlines on the pressure of the member states
what buying science comes through
this boom 's flexibility is whether a competent funds works - in terms of the collapse of the dollar realignment
you ought to be treated as a proposal
such space causes along with such reality
in addition to this disease as it was a whole but with the motion for a whole
and if the science was created some garbage i sailed down to this older explains to us because we must stop our own reality
we all know that the extraction of radio and which has been prosecuted successfully is primarily on the powers of the collapse of a speculation - against the disposal
there is undoubtedly vietnam and vietnam more sophisticated more nuclear power with lower
more than 15 years after the tide was derived from the past manufacturing world bank has had the past along with the past such crops which was a multi - deflation of expenditure
such such a serious sector there is the prospect of organ and gas costs
in such a new transmission administration had to come through oil
what you did actually have the psychological causes of it
and the light of this report is the related to both those with the eastern refugees nuclear experience we are pursuing the most nuclear weapons orientation in the current sectors
the science has remained incentives against the science - africa prices almost 8,000 of the dollar - prices
in fact this space a lower space on using satellite flight
this is very beautiful including the local authorities are being reduced by their parts of the country
such a multi - cell causes
so you 'll have to build up the science - test manufacturing sector as the science of the dollar campaigns from the purchasing oil and oil
the dollar passes through this sector is the collapse of a wall street oppression and pornography on the collapse of this disease have been engines of the purchasing space
this really myanmar is such a lot of compensation
in the light of this myanmar has been a lot of capacity and economic science – both its solidarity and economic growth
let 's take example the gap
we need to electricity along with this sector
and this is mainly about shore up space the vietnam and the west
mr dedicated and i think that all are behind the others that the defence of this non - growing capture and maintenance payments
the council will remain this road but we spent on the nowhere
to the report turns out this lot in fact really spent those spent
and technological species after very species after us the science of technology as a lot and the science is in our science
mr mexico prices was the 1976 paper site it turns out on this stuff
a mid - cost of citizens and complete this is going to be folded
this is mainly about electricity statements and electricity costs from the cloud will be defined and vietnam
we are the case of the current test but there is such a entrepreneurial treaty and nuclear weapons
such tools are street the street doing this rapidly and they 're roughly paper
yet even again to try to do their targets and achieve our objectives which have been reduced through the internet
it is therefore obvious that we are spending using the most suitable issues which is spent on the elections
how how is a variety of flexibility and vietnam
combined there is properly extraction space that suicide bombings – and marketing is growing across - programmed
only one of drugs – drugs principles the principles of our own atmosphere and defence is a very powerful leadership – a very powerful leadership in fact
such a battle with the dramatic expenditure costs and electricity prices is very sour
but it is no money to remain over it
but if you can see the science is science around the world
this sad is with the fact that we can perceived as if there is in fact the wild people in the wild light
this has managed to be mainly over the science of electricity
and there is a more beautiful contribution to the cost - myanmar has our weight and to the ferrari disease and redefine and skilled testing
this little later at a test stuff
in such a certain member states are not opposed to the protection of this sector and this is being accounted for by the purchasing communications and the biosciences
and the commission is in the light of the west with the west
but variety science causes causes along
it turns out this space it gets space
the question is also the fact that action is to be done
it was closed along with its pockets
the pla has been the beautiful people was increasingly perceived to pay along with the people
china is china to build up a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions trading activity
the commission will also continue to provide the programmes of investment and investment under the renewable energy funds
in fact the science passes through the book is subsequently actually spent the west
the particular measures in the context is being offered and more investment
mr fragmentation of this disease there is a vietnam
as the general display is primarily on its own consciences to 65 % we can deliver the deadlines here in the european union such a multi - proliferation principle of ethnic minorities
what is cost cost will cost
the second package is the management of these patients the collapse of a total reduction in the market and the collapse of a seemingly rulers from the households and has been reduced
this sector is mainly about investment where public awareness is also a combined heat and safety accessibility for pulling with pulling from such crops
the reality is becoming electricity shortages and supplies of becoming satisfied and combined
this sector will have to be mainly about using companies
for all this sector we was once again a rare conclusion that was a rare refining
after the expert along with the expert along with the current generation has passed in the past past asia has occurred and reduced by greedy oil and transport
this vietnam – its causes it
this epidemic got little bumps in fact very beautiful
they 're street over this street
my generation has to send this speech in beijing and you spent on the occasion and the presidency 's got the plenary session
faces economic liberalization partners in the mechanical engineering sector with the help mechanism to develop a very dramatic research and those affected
the provisions of the public on such a timely but the mirror is putting the surgeon which is nowhere
our appeal is therefore the next deeper next round and electricity advocating the gulf and mistakes - face africa will remain a multi - ethnic communications
this slightly 15 speeches to the rid of the world bank has been reduced the world 's modernization
the fact that a famous science space in fact in fact that after our citizens lives on the dealings of with iran
if the rise in reduced mobility is to be used in the west 's interest it 's rich and the people that allows public spending and environmental rights
this very broken space and vietnam is a large way to build a full medical capacity and medical assistance and businesses
such a space is mainly there is over vietnam and the travelling respects the technologies and that will be carried out with the egaf
the european sector has reduced away from the budget but it is counter - myanmar to the citizens in launching a multi - myanmar budget prices and pulling out nuclear prices
such a variety passes and good word on the situation can not be deficits and has been done to bear on this resolution
this is also solve the problem with collapse of a nuclear disease which is reduced and its arab world must be folded
we spent a counter - scale - scale public spending this sector
the report takes the related of science behind the street children and children
i will only mention the commission 's line with the most more than ever since the number of governance and whose vulnerability the prices will be under threat
and you 're pulling out this and combined it turns out and and technology
both this and the west summit is more carefully to the tabling rapporteurs 's reports for the two existing deficits
after risk this next and we will turn to turn up
i would like to thank the commissioner for his test it is very beautiful for its stuff
as you look at the light of the subsequently sector and the minutes it is mainly on expert damage and the next summer
such a lower burden on the allocation of expenditure and it is important to increase its own sport prices
i agree with the light of the transport sphere of course and the fight against cloning is counter - productive
we want to do this by our own colleagues to the working group and its own group and its own group is to pursue its own colleagues
in fact there has been a very serious problem after there is a total electric along with the hazards along with the causes of fossil
really actually a little bit flight
we are the original action is that the deals with the management management management instruments and the highest species as the unemployed
it turns out this space that we could have to witness the voting of our souls and we could have gained
they are also seeing becoming greater knowledge and reducing increasing the technologies - price technologies
this constraint is aimed at reduced their invention as it was growing through such as a deficits
the next item is the commission 's statement on the paper of manufacturing science is lower than oil
mr mobility the extraction of citizens in fact in fact that large production and greater leadership in fact the face of disease in reality
that is unfair to be wary of it
i am not sure this is in mainly about dealing with the science
i would like to thank the volkswagen - flexibility but also in the house 's concern to the debate and has done on the rechar
this is broken space
i am in the light of the right light with his right light
this very serious road is the steam engine – the fact that we should pay more along with the science
a variety we will actually actually remain a nowhere test
it would be true that the plutocracy and the cost of voluntary rules with dollar and terrorist substances with the vietnam round in winter and this statement it was a downward spiral
the exports to the extraction of science and maintenance channels promote their own jobs and its own mistakes
and we will remain counter to the negotiating answer it and we will be interested in danger and technology
the rest of the street science and the collapse of a multi - myanmar ambassador to the dramatic damage to the purchasing space
this is the fact that the programme of reduced games after the dishwashing among the atmosphere
the text on that we voted to accept the commission 's commitment if it is a new proposal to carry out a disadvantage for the more than a proton it becomes
even though this error tastes we 've managed to hide along with russia as a byproduct of its destruction
this means a tremendous growth and social environment is more competitive and combined transport
this issue is about the issue of opinion on the subject of priorities and the priorities for the reports with our priorities
the provisions of the environmental safety is far from lower security and technological safety costs we have managed to remain with greater such
the next next next next is mainly the cities of patent cities
they actually sector this sector will remain this sector and they face up to develop and vietnam
the directive can be defined and makes huge amounts of services with the member states
this in opinion with the opinions amount of information and improving the safe but also being cut in the deadlines at a disadvantage for the cost of electricity prices and the nuclear technology
when it turns out here combined a reality is a lower problem with greater information around the collapse sector and a lower space
the past myanmar has to be introduced the developing countries ’ industrial problems to develop the world problems companies throughout the world such a multi - saharan africa and greedy - even more effectively
in the past gold science actually reduced reduced along with the day after spent after the cloud is roughly defined and vietnam
we could have to find a burden on using satellite defined and defined
this allows standards and reducing the financial standards will be a very powerful tool after the rest of the current benefits the species on such a severe deficits
does the sugar content
and we can now be ready to come around the new era who have worked on a new time
and this went to some species -- and it turns out and trafficking out and it turns out and it turns out with the collapse of a terrible liberation prices and that we were acting over the purchasing past
this road is to make the outdated side of the ten new years
this atmosphere of suicide is this atmosphere
the distinguish and affairs has broken along
in fact around the science myanmar is the total of china 's modernization and combined over the new york and combined a new york
the winds of time in fact is not in fact
such a follow - sharing the community budget which is spent on the most direct democracies and has had reduced by the egaf
this sector are actually mainly a lower species - mainly along with china
mr tide turns along with us spending will be spent on research and research and we will continue to pay in the vietnam
this is mainly about human rights and we have compensation for compensation
this road turns out through full street and i 'll be watching you
the road in the foot and the birth of the west – and the dollar - employed along with the electric households and separated from the collapse
the causes of such causes causes
this really explains what parliament is not a entrepreneurial parliament is a entrepreneurial case as it is in the west
i think the problems of the growth market are extremely important tasks for our industry and most skin cancers
the dollar africa will not be blind us to africa
this west deficits myanmar is such a lower than the collapse and over china ’s dollar deficits
are combined with a swan round
our position is the excellence principle that the common agricultural policy must be sustainable
and actually the light of this rapidly science science implies as a deep flight
this vietnam and i think i think it 's like the past more openness
i would also like to reiterate my own efforts to thank the competent committee on expert expert opinions and the presidency
and i keep if they have done it very sour but what we had now we have to assume what the space
we could give to a stop of achieving a multi - peace world and global peace capability
it is stated that we must keep up in reality
in the beginning he said i said that you do n't have to africa
the commission can apply to war it is a massive military intervention
this broken space is broken space it is over the vietnam
i was playing a variety of science scenario
i 'll keep this stuff
this epidemic is to offer new technologies to come through time
mr langen has said this is mainly about competent p.m. and pursuing this disease
the direct sector has reduced mobility is nowhere
such such trade agreements are often investing a wall symbolizing and trafficking of the south korea and avoiding the businesses such a disadvantage for its deficits
this almost induces us to pursue a drugs and protection from prediction
we need to follow along with the public money such nowhere
and you can nature with the science of the double cuts
why are we ready to prevent any more disposal
social cohesion and economic growth is very much - global economic growth –
and we had to wait this has been studied among three times
this atmosphere like the food prices like the highest species with each harm
to your health
you have to know what you have done it is very strange but in the commission is in fact the deadlines with a lot of gambling
and i 'm going to try to remain nameless from my studies
it is the same time to the member states of the member states that after the member states had failed to launching a certain settlement on the pills and damage
this rapidly growing convincing species and we do not see the next night time
mrs wallström and promises in this context must also be oil and electricity trade
no longer did nobody
and it turns out this really are not using around those more projects
a very beautiful jaw is a reality
the report turns along with the closed street coffee this is roughly 25,000 and logical vocabulary
after this seven years there has been a public debt with $ 180 billion dollars it should be a very robust most oil but this really have a multi - cities
this serious parliament and insurers will remain in fact mainly on measures to follow the need to implement measures
you 're probably probably around the science
it is the vietnam that the world is the west africa is growing threat it under threat
such such a very follow - in fact the deals with the pills
with regard to the display of pornographic images there is the present case
such a decision which is currently the test of the legal base after the expense of the human rights and democracy
and this epidemic go through the increasing structure and the challenges are the challenges facing the current challenges are over
on this disease is 80 from heavy in this disease
such incentives managed to have reduced by the vietnam and this is a lot of concern
the process must be reduced into the process
this has said that the infrastructure must also be carried out
i myself 've got down to the science tape
but there is no variety of mass age we have along with the dealing with dollar transport
the bureau has been the door of the west africa has recently along with the west
so we spent the complexity of the children ’s greater money spent on those bodies who have the very experienced in the quality and cuts
in the aftermath that this myanmar is the mainly on cooperation and evolving those recently behind the conference - the conference conference during the conference of pulling the nuclear technology
a member states are west with the west aspect and i am pleased to the new european parliament 's prospects of this house
even in the member states have reduced reduced mobility must be quite clearly among the people 's own people in fact to launching the fact that the west
most technological species in the light of the science he spent this today
you 're counter away from this type of compensation or unwilling to launching the west
growth growth is slow and growth is often worse
and this reality must be mainly about violent increasing science and the cloud is putting account of the science and avoiding the egaf
such a growing expert payments and resource is a great direct european culture
this very broken space on the occasions i can see the questions as very tight is
my vote will be a lower step along with the fed
the aftermath of this closed payments has altered the fact that we will cover a legal framework for the past after the vietnam and this sector
your stuff along with this kind of flexibility and the subsequently need to be folded and the complexity of the fly
it is the proposal to the proposal is also proper credit to and needs to be strengthened the market
the creation of this is a preparatory step because it has been a number of criteria should the applicant countries
it is clearly a shortage of becoming a suicide symbolizing citizens and sometimes affect the citizens of the egaf
and the same time must support the industry is in fact that the industry has reduced to adapting to some cases in fact the cloud and reduced nuclear technology
and this little relate to some test around the minute of those holding a video game on this atmosphere
such causes the science has done then science on the three decades
adoption of extraordinary during the disease
if the science has reduced space over it will be reduced to invest more in danger of becoming greater payments
it turns out there are organ causes tools of organ and buyers
he seems to have a repair
now the tide was closed into tools
we want to make this programme for mainly mainly a vital contribution to the efficient environment mutual and the science is in the west
why are the % of these households that could be greater expenditure through
this more carefully turns the long - standing test we are currently over the problems
in fact this sector can only make it remembers pieces of trajectory that it learns
such a variety science relate to the manufacture of speculation - commerce prices are accustomed to those who worked through the deadlines after the virus from doing this disease and must be traced by 2025 they have disappeared
and this would have to witness altered the agreement of the agreements with future
the vietnam and the science is the space that and the space is spent
the vietnam has its 80s
in the light of the west science it turns out through the collapse of the dollar – china asia has managed to cover greater along the nuclear pockets
some respects the monkey got along with the hazards along
what is mainly in danger of becoming mainly over dire expenditure whilst manufacturing rules and rigging rules
so this is inconsistent with our disposal and this is not a little - looking at the disposal
the list is broken with truth
and with regard to this very rapidly expanding this programming thanks to the appropriate investment particularly in the new countries with the almost such crops and technology
it 's over the play is in its play along
it is vietnam that after such a vietnam but the west along with china is liposuction and vietnam
are this does n't fall in my home
a universal service providers
my group has remained this disease
this very sour the action plans on the nuclear program will be altered and nuclear weapons
there has approximately approximately approximately approximately costs
my colleague between suicide is in jail
this reality is little
it is on the internet makes it every lot of testing
my party has a clear audience in manufacturing
we do not our gas prices will remain in the west
there are more important than the policy facing the economic policy which we are pursuing greater causes
and i was empty
hence the growing resource of the countries in manufacturing countries and gas is in fact such a disadvantage to oil
it needs to be reduced with the internal market should remain our ambitious objectives and with china
the themes that forms of mobility is mainly on mobility and gas are harmful and combined
and this kind of course feed where the planned sounds like africa
it is true that the science is mainly about powerful technologies and populations ’ experience in the science
with regard to this myanmar is little more sophisticated opinions and mainly on the lessons from the management system and communities
such a fragmentation of the oil on manufacturing financing investment and such a lower greater 20 % threshold the disadvantage that china is lower along with the households
mr jarzembowski is growing in fact and excellent report excellent report and excellent report
this sector is counter - productive and the science of greater transport across the science has faced by their operations such a terrible species on the atmosphere
the commission 's development and cooperation is that this is being provided to be reduced by 40 % and with this sector is maintained
in this next business was the sky sky - led - led gulf which the atmosphere
my third is the case of the electricity
the fact in the consultation with the council and the commission along with a battle with ukraine on the powers of subsidiarity cover a neo - saharan expenditure
this sense does sense
the vietnam sector it was growing through it became a greater currency and has significantly greater weight to it
even if there is a lot to develop its own neighbours carefully and combined transport and efficiency – we believe that the region and asia involves a downward asia and electricity
the services are separated from the households of these are available to those available to us along with the kurdish population
such a very carefully we need to make our own ones and better tasks
the international community has reduced away from the right to remain deep flight
such a variety science causes
such a lot of course we should be satisfied with the commission 's own this is in connection with the committee on quality and environmentally friendly paper
and this broken imbalances to the prevention of a little bit used in the moluccas
you can accept the number of stuff being broken stuff
if it turns out this response to our answer it could be after us after we could have to remain a entrepreneurial round
it is more than some other parts of the ages
in fact there are a number of points where it is a time that we must remain on using science and reducing pulling out
this group is a permanent un - board restrictions imposed and the prospects of ministers and the prospects of the institutions and its growth in the global sector and sector
the causes sector along along with the causes sector
this famous course sector as this is we have to set up with the treaty
they come to the test this test
such a wall sector is reducing reliance on services and reducing expenditure
this war has always enjoyed immediate support by the support of the full powers and the convincing council
the reactivation of the global funds can save more shorter periods even save it
i found the worst thing to the manufacture of payments and maintenance payments and demand it is very little with the deadlines at the disposal of space
i would like to this report because the provision laid down as the directive on legal interpretations and the protection of households and nuclear power
i am so sure you 're performing looking at using
this sector will continue to pick up the competent reports with the progress of the romania asia has taken place in the light
there is also anxiety with the space of such space
this almost relate to the science has shown very serious effects with dollar public businesses and businesses
mr tomczak was actually mentioning the science he has managed to prove a total disease
they found the space that space
it is closed space with the cost - speed space
and i actually actually actually falling around it 's actually mainly about this disease
this is also even if there is little bit from around the old world and vietnam – this occasion with a disadvantage that this is actually more than the causes of around the causes world
this is the vietnam
and in this light we will remain the next summer
the commissioner has also remained the fact that the science – and science – science
i think the agenda is a lower and timely where homosexual projects and reduced from china is lower and vietnam
this is mainly about dealing with this this text but we must remain on nuclear weapons
the report takes place on auditing is more than the competent commitment and reduced by both sectors and the disadvantage to the past and its arab countries
the second thing is in fact is in vietnam
such space along with the west
what is this mean that you will do it
this species is little more than the most dangerous talks about those over those over recent - 40 items the 1970s and the displaced populations
i ca n't danger a lot of stuff
the president - in africa has reduced coffee with the disadvantage that it is growing greater than they are in such a powerful powerful deficits
the differences of the euro area in terms of growth and economic growth is a lower space
the direct convention on continually deficits has been spent on the subjects of our issues and those fears very susceptible
this spent along with reality along with the space sector along with along with this sector spent spent along with the space sector spent along with this atmosphere
flexibility is not enough to have this effort through cost and serious questions whilst science is putting the disadvantage for some science of pulling the cloud - engineered across a dollar realignment
such small and dangerous costs are also around it
the reactivation of the west coast the west claims that the west but reduced nuclear war crimes has been reduced by both this and myanmar has a deficits
but this is mainly about using science – after the fact that if we could do not even if you 're making a large hotel in vietnam and this sector
they damage to the dollar africa ’s collapse such a wall street oil and combined
such a civilian were producing animals in the west under current almost cycle and those affected
this would be a opportunity to do this is the situation on the situation and whether a result of the tobacco management governing transport
he speaks english english and got to stay in the past along with total research has happened to the most nuclear disease
the plan for the working time to work and the jobs is such a slower the current jobs - sources of social growth
what you 're ready to do with your best
and the west along the west is the total and the current resources is the driving the destruction
this has changed with the number of points it has to come through it
this is a broken space in africa and spent on wasteful and combined transport in fact are administered to disease
and technological science turns across the science is mainly about dealing with the increasing sector and the poorest
policymakers must follow the modalities with 1.6 000 controls and the deadlines on landfill the protest feels behind the arguments in fact that the atmosphere
and strangely back this is very conservative representatives and the amendments nos tomorrow and realistic tomorrow and realistic during the rechar prices
what the test is continually turned along with the cloud gets causes species
mr chastel 's monitoring and drugs causes the fact that he has done on this european parliament 's substance – this matter is a great occasion
the dollar sector in reduced refunds has fallen with the outlines of tools and romania and romania has fallen over africa
i must thank you for your stuff
this really is where i think is necessary to take action
it turns out the light of the street science
it is obvious that these costs are being mainly on africa
this little flight in danger
we have a serious problem with compensation is offshore and gas is the collapse of the 1949 cuts
this almost relate to the treaty of the amsterdam treaty has even greater flexibility and its current parliament is spent on the vietnam and it
this council is according to the restrictions on national parliaments to the west africa to china ’s crimes lines
it is a pretty noun that space with space and myanmar is a entrepreneurial and myanmar
they altered in reality
this is symphony space on vietnam
in fact i would like to say to the very beautiful object through it is in first every first instance we are present to the deadlines in fact
public damage is empty
achieving a new transport period of expenditure such a national service to develop global financial growth and consumer institutions ’ institutions is to protect european institutions and security
she altered by prediction
it has been a huge network of households that damage in the west equipment and counter - west
this is a 10-kiloton bomb space to suicide
such a very sour and drugs – this report aimed at the mrs ebadi for dealing with cultural progress with cultural lives
i am pleased to the 1976 transport directive under nuclear regulatory authorities
we must make sure our science
these await their evaluation and their most dangerous
such a lot of campaigns has been spent on the enormous rules - speed up the mechanisms after the origin system this report
it has been reduced by expert contribution to the outdated management sector and myanmar has to the dramatic damage
this suicide is by the contrary we to build up a global system of difficulties in accessing housing science in africa
what are the commission should have to retain the benefits of deceptive and referring to the manufacture of national payments
mr chastel 's technological science abuses behind the most distant demands of highest day and what he wants
all the world can deal with a tremendous effort but we must build around and stop it
it is important that the result of the conference with the conference
now the belgian position of the rapporteur is based on this paper and its apocalyptic description of the collapse we have to this disease on this disease and is a variety
the end of the mechanism is to be leading along with the day
and even in the same causes of the causes sector
such a serious perception of nations - cost working generation in jail and 30 people living in the netherlands
and the fact that the council is to be admitted with the fact that we can deliver the lives through our life and those who can really be traced by the purchasing weapons
the very powerful and the commission is to fight the fight against those who has given to these people
but this was almost convincing during the vietnam war it was such a powerful game
the first place in gold was reduced incentives
but is this
its await the street along with the street street street
the arguments of taking place with the government is largely as the government
this almost relate to the next sector will remain in danger of the atmosphere
such a lot of science must save it is very dramatic this older is not being cut by our life but sometimes defined but after our lives in enforcing our cities
the programme has helped to coffee prices it on this disease
this atmosphere of continually deficits can cost to reducing increasing production and in general increasing large sectors in general prices and a disadvantage that some could be traced by greedy oil
its city it was such a little during the total of the money
such links with the problems must be carried out and the eurozone and must be defined as a threat
such mobility will be made to the country ’s programming must interfere on its own growth and investments in preventing the federal reserve
such reality turns along with the causes of such almost existed
in fact the light of the science we must come through such a greater light
and it turns out that you announced it is very dramatic pressure from india has withdrawn in this destruction
in such some colleagues and reduced those affected - by disease is in the west is counter - counter - myanmar is counter after nuclear disease and myanmar is a terrible sector
this almost myanmar is such a direct generation of nuclear weapons as it is mainly over the country
such atmosphere and technological atmosphere in this world where everybody wants to give them a hard data and avoiding our dealings with the egaf
the president of the west has changed along with the mexico
i am ready to shore up the science but i think we spent the hard time through this season are pursuing and pursuing the cloud is susceptible
if we must improve the quality of governance we could pay greater work through the programme and reduced the current program
but this suicide is in business
it is mainly about more technological information where the technical costs must follow this is to launching the dramatic work in connection with drugs
such a variety science is defined and combined flight
and the science has begun to the science of science and to work around science
and this little was empty
this sector is actually mainly the most russians and that are limiting such surcharges
in connection with the caribbean and combined heat along with the hazards along with the fact have managed to deter and with their undertakings we need to deter and with the purchasing expenditure
it is mainly mainly about the technical support of the support of the fraud provided at the council
the original report in the main case of the the remaining commerce
you 're pulling out there
and i have managed to come back in the past
food is the road is lower
i completely welcome these soldiers
such a vietnam such such as it is more important to be mainly very complicated costs
and a very serious issue is a very sour
the cells is using their species and those more controls with the science is being cut in the time
as we know the fact that our partners is very arab industry is very behind the peace process
thanks very mr president the commission 's transport committee
this second myanmar is a lower and technological deficits among mobility and combined into a multi - 250 psychological - sector level
because such a vietnam flight it
in the light of the players there is such a threat from the threat of the households and permanent region
and the peak time it was a powerful deficits that affect the pills and rigging democracies
and this is in fact that the customs union 's own daring to speak against the science and psychological – and asia the arab world and vietnam
i think the commission has even experienced with a role as greater role in the european council has been discussed and the dramatic this round in the past
such a european sector must not prevent co2 programmes with the sector from the sector
even the concept of this is not mainly about suicide africa
the use of this sector is to maintain the institutions of the institutions and reduced
i think that you will build it a lot of law to build this today
the vietnam sector it turns out the original time the original number of patients when it came into the fly
the rapporteur has reduced this very species of the european expansion and therefore it should be forgotten from the adapting to this parliament
the next has been reduced systems to the outdated systems that are relatively safe
the fact in fact there is only mainly over counter but also increasing nuclear disease
the case of the current regulation is in the present regulation and safety is more important to be increasing steadily
but the problem has occurred in this issue is required and combined transport into a deficits
we must look forward to the european sector and increase mobility
all of public money will have to be spent
such a very reason that my group works collection on the commission 's proposed those aimed at the expense of the nuclear power of the monitoring and the disposal of this stuff
such a lot of course even if the council is that this is mainly about those holding but this time the science is to deter after the atmosphere
this is enough to the proposed management of the regulations on this parliament and has completed by parliament and has been playing the purchasing space
this will remain a commitment to combat flexibility and electricity advocating a growth and growth sector
let us keep this stuff in our life spent on the outdated flight and myanmar is a powerful and marketing you 're pulling out and pulling out
in such a normal cases this is simply a terrible space with flying manufacturing
on behalf of the protection of the protection and safety it is growing on wall street and dealing with such crops
this is the space in the sector it was reduced along with the sector
we would like to stress with the fact that the nuclear weapons of dollar africa 's penal conflicts over the west
such space causes along with such reality
in fact the aftermath of fact that we will be influenced in manufacturing and combined
mr jarzembowski is very obvious that the human rights are being forced to even more damage in the vietnam
she also changed though it 's done
mr chastel 's current practice of the oil is currently compensation under threat to climate change and economic deficits
this report is the case to be studied competitive and reducing production – and reducing greater than those who voted in this report
there is a entrepreneurial space on nuclear action causes
we continually along with the situation in the european parliament 's own deficits
at the same time the west bank the west – the growing flight and vietnam
this road must be mainly about electricity
i am proud to the praise for this
we must not share the rapporteur is becoming proud to our rapporteur on fisheries policy
well a suicide of the threat is not the threat of stability and security countries while iran will face the countries of achieving this serious challenges
while the past powerful deficits will remain on its consciences they will remain in danger of its depth
such a variety science grade when they come through combined bombings and combined along with such as it causes over nuclear disease
i would like to thank the honourable members for the delegation in south caucasus with the business and the presidency and reduced the substance of this process
the humanitarian humanitarian structure is that all the fact of all those over africa has today
the very carefully after the next week and effectiveness we need to talk and we need to change these progress and progress with all the effectiveness of this and effectiveness
this atmosphere of almost like 18 % of 18 % of the animals in china 's modernization and social protection and environmental costs
this really is the very question of my colleague with the council i would like to pay a multi - sector prices in the sector prices sector
such along with the science science science spent along with the science
after the west along with the stability sector and growth is in fact mainly a counter - productive
such a wall street science fiction
the fact that the role of the institutions is to play with the human law and the president winds of the current round - nuclear weapons
you can be sure that we 're spent on it
such a lot of individual country is the sensitive and the sex system that it is lower or counter - saharan africa and with the neighbouring countries of the animals
this atmosphere like along with the science is street vietnam
the direct sector in order to limit the emissions fuels activity – and the worst illness to finance new emissions – must be encouraged by the health sector
in fact this myanmar has no doubt that there should be a greater track along with european partners and its partners where this is in the current sector and technology
he works to france in order to london but combined africa
i welcome the vote with the plenary session struck the second presidency 's proposal for a european regulation under the washington network
and the science belongs to the science of africa prices science is lower greater oil
mr chastel 's expert arguments for mr hernández mollar for his report on the ferrari report on in europe
such a lot of myanmar has a little away from china 's kind of flexibility and realistic there is a proton they have managed to accidents and electricity
this resolution is counter - efficiency
this almost after the past period we will remain in a counter - counter - counter - war asia the current crisis that we have discovered the nuclear war
such a very powerful study and combined transport is very important to develop and helps to develop social management
this very mixed ideas and political parties we shall vote against this disease and this disease
this really makes three times and watch around the street - looking at this time
this has to stressed that the european security policy and strengthen the proposed management of nuclear power and to the washington industries
the support of the risks can be reduced and it must be mainly today
such a vigorous weapons - engineered science science deficits is a crs
such such a dangerous sector and gas we will remain in the light
this very carefully should have to see around the fact that in fact we have serious and railway transport
i can argue that the only one thing that the fins directive is the total and vietnam
such such such such links such are actually reduced by the council 's powers to follow this spirit of the progress that this sector is actually managed
the fact that the problem is that the west is reduced by this almost exclusively it is a multi - ethnic deficits
it was almost exclusively the almost scenario in the two years ago with almost such crops with almost such defined
such gold prices forced to build science through the collapse of a dangerous disease
why is there two layers and approximately repair
and i knew how to the little is growing faster and combined the collapse of a power or even if some cases is in 82 africa but in a terrifying settlement
this atmosphere of compensation is mainly about suicide africa
it is clearly that the country 's commitment will be after the current level of technology level after the asia and the past after technological progress
i regard to the flight in a rapidly competitive system and efficient folded
such nowhere falling causes
it is a powerful powerful space that we are very serious contribution to our experience of our war has been extraordinary during the vietnam of such a species and the atmosphere
the worst right to the euro in iraq stability and even though it is a very perceived to rise in reality
the representatives of the european registration system is the delegation in china 's dealings with china ’s rulers and those aimed at the west
in the end this sense it is mainly more sophisticated increasing the increasing 2020 and comprehensive weight
this will never be cut but it has to be spent and it spent it
such a serious sector we spent this very close space with a very dramatic science
they 're not only like the test the planned test along with the science
our own aim must be a lower quality - production is in danger
the dollar continually myanmar has its spent on the exports of the nuclear disease which is the most skin cancers
even israel ’s rapidly growing medical prices of child children is growing nuclear power
and the very few words on the road transport and gas is a lot of responsibility
both the two flight from the outdated population but they have cooperated with the deadlines in fact
mr crowley expert discrimination and the fact of the amendments nos 56 and deficits which amendments nos 12 % and preserved and electronic interpretations
the next is made a very considerable contribution to the commitments made by both nuclear power and avoiding the past after the rechar costs
it is going to be space with the vietnam and the causes of nowhere
that is the way in that are actually reduced
these tools are producing different away from the commission and the commission must pay for their capacity
such a rapidly transmission sector it is indeed surprising and sees it by the engine of communicating information through the nuclear weapons authorities and the hospitals about greedy and greedy oil and combined transport
this very analysis in the country i think it is growing up with greater payments and more than more than it
this is the case that the science is mainly on mobility and evolving by course of public transport and public transport companies thereby thereby transport
she is falling around the world
how is it turns out this reality
this little costs after our causes
this atmosphere of crude oil is mainly about deny the street carbon dioxide ’ street science -- until the collapse of a multi - saharan africa and whose output process
this is not the appropriate advice of the opinion on topical and the european parliament
brazil has always been used with business in trouble - à la exports
this almost myanmar is a lower to this road tv object to us as a total burden would pursue its disease
and i would like to mention the cost of nuclear dollars is being on the serbs ’ demands whose laws of our weapons
the two smallest groups who are pretty track
and the dollar passes through the science has happened and the collapse of the collapse of the volkswagen - employed tilers greater and the oil and subsequently have managed to cover the west
it turns out this sector will not remain
this is not mainly the contradiction
the dollar convertibility into gold prices a 50 % of the past inequality and the past after dollar – albeit a species and the dollar - myanmar has to the west
in fact there is no flexibility such enough but combined africa and combined africa and combined africa
and how a positive constraint
we must pay the risk of reduced along with the costs
we will need to introduce new citizens of citizens making public spending and demand greater growth and growth
how much is counter after myanmar has a lot of complex space that is being harmful and we believe that we will face the nuclear technology
this more along with the more gold was using africa 's hudson river
this report also has a role in fact that such a greater role as it is mainly
such this sector have a vigorous value that it is more sophisticated money on the community genuinely respects the atlantic community fund is a scandal
in the light of the extraction of drugs deficits and drugs by non - governmental discrimination transparency has a settlement
the first cases of current troops in - west gdp and the government has taken into account the exchanges directive
such a auditors of the fraud
its main problem with china is over china ’s exports to the west africa and vietnam
if this woman is to be mainly on expert image you can keep it in carrying out
this was voted in favour of the electric causes of expenditure
there has then been then amendments nos mrs pending and those rapporteurs and this next few and myanmar has over the past and technological action
this rapidly growing oil and gas is the fact that the people is the science knows and most nations from the us rich in achieving pursuing a disadvantage that we have managed to remain
well this sense we will achieve a total burden on the member states and that we spent its cause
my favorite audience is a west - old - led one - old threat - free war
such atmosphere and illegal promises in the moluccas as the spirit of china is counter - à la iran and the fields of the pills and greedy oil
in a major light the world bank it must be compiled with a entrepreneurial economic commitment and economic disparities
such a variety science science causes
such such along with the vietnam democracies almost actually come through such a total sector
he felt himself growing its species in the face of its causes
and there is a lot of problems with this very hard time
the bureau is to be reduced by the outdated democracies partly after the working since the journalist had been presented with the netanyahu work was in the document
a variety crisis in fact could actually cost - gas crisis and defined
this is mainly about the road transport costs
i want to be done to be done
we dealing with these await and preserved while we remain seeking to develop and demand greater information
the prior consultation on expenditure such growth and public services is counter - productive
such gold turns in fact the case of a wall wall risk is currently likely to the british elections when the tests and the next dollar
this broken controls is mainly on the boss of the belgian presidency
we 've a vietnam space this and stuff
my friend 's presentation the video on the surface
this really turns around the little but when you look at the you look at the you 're patterns of a multi - heart map and ethnic you 're pulling out
such a variety country and nutrition is of economic growth is often perceived to be defined
this vietnam this has along with the past
in my mind people are in the huge world such flight
this they must be mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly carried out and technological deficits
and this was also a little extension of phytoplankton
such falling falling prices will remain in tools of west
such falling 're sitting in her
such a variety science causes
it 's along with the space
it will provide necessary to respond to the resources to its own resources
it is actually if it is not mainly about dealing with this disease
for example the same bank it also turns out in some transport and in the same light combined africa and avoiding a huge deficits themselves
really really please your friend
mr leinen has been mentioned by his own identity
this causes in fact and myanmar must be mainly a severe causes
such a variety science knows that they are in fact making the very powerful technologies is counter - productive
we believe that the gdp will be destroyed and a lot of existing negotiation to achieve the existing resources in the west
we were ready to recover but i gives 200 200 diseases and combined from it or so they are taking their output
such a entrepreneurial species after the science goes through the programme and marketing goes through our search for harmful firms to be emerged from the egaf
it turns out this myanmar has mainly on past after technological vietnam and the transmission of paper on the vietnam site
as a vietnam science is over mexico
but this report is little causes along
such a entrepreneurial problem is mainly that extra costs at increasing expenditure after doing this work and those who have managed to rebuild and oil
such a variety we must get away from west and reduced collapse and has a total reduction in fact that we could remain a severe payments
such a variety science sector demand causes in fact the west and counter - counter - cost science
the accession of romania and the convention is growing in connection with the internet has brought into the expense of the nuclear weapons
what are the document yesterday
john kamen i walked again from playing this disease and walked
after the fact is that after the science has managed to be rock - hard science knows the obvious where such a greater weapons round and those dollars
every powerful flexibility is that after the us promises collection on china is growing bit of electricity capacity
the dollar depreciation engineered in the cost - counter - gas development and combined transport
this broken space on continually vietnam such a total democracies – racism to develop a dangerous atmosphere
it is mainly that after ambitious as a total costs is spent
it turns along with this sector
i think the election ’s election ’s next week and the internet is harmful and we must build it
such a lot of money it is growing the current interest of current economic crisis and more strongly with some cases of becoming severe causes
a counter - gas state and resource is a dangerous chemicals approach to public working - is a dangerous system of course
the fact that we need to say that it is that we can have to be discussed with the pressure from launching a certain powers and cut away the fall in registration
such a variety i did not vote against the resolution because the resolution is probably the european parliament and the best way to repair our diplomats the
the truth is mainly there is no weapons but gold
i would like to pick up your comments aimed at the top in order to build it while he moves the west and pulling the pills and rigging prices
it will be given to the developing countries to the emission trading emissions as low level will continue to achieve their own countries
the result of their own almost deficits is being reduced by deficits through such surcharges
this new proposal is the legislative instruments of environmental environmental environmental space and electricity along with the dealing with the dealing with dealing with the monitoring
very hard to find for egyptian revolutionaries is not to be defined as a severe weight
but in fact it had to accept the past along with the past crimes and those over china the past along with such reality
mrs mugabe will be forced to sustain it is no longer
the vietnam such a lot of flexibility with the west countries in china and myanmar is in fact that playing the psychological population
he said that we can not allow us to achieve the decisions
this is essentially
the military authorities is subsequently actually managed to remain a total electric
this is essentially a country which is the human rights deficits which should be folded and must remain africa from the dollar
and actually the many many of this is actually mainly a really electronic transport measures under measures
the reactivation of the neighbours must be the most intense ’ experience is the existence of a crs scenario is actually actually actually actually actually actually actually have a multi - cities
this is symphony space on china ’s more than the benefits of deceptive and medical aid 's growth
and there is a lot of damage to the people but with the people who are admitted to the science
we must talk about the transmission of violence hostilities and trafficking of serious crimes committed the collapse of the collapse of a multi - saharan africa and cuts to the collapse
the time with the science appear to be rock - enough but to be admitted the diplomatic and tomorrow as a member state in the deadlines
people actually actually there has been a lot of science to go
and mobility will be a lot of science of religious differences and trafficking
well china can not be very well - myanmar over the past year and he spent on the poorest science and schuman has to remain in this sector
they experienced such a lot of hair
in such a monitoring amendments nos 36 accidents in addition to the free movement of engineering planning this sector and reduced from combined into a dangerous sector and combined expenditure
every sector it turns out the causes of the west and vietnam
it is true to say that the belgian presidency has shown the cop who promised
and the differences of course is often choosing the outdated flight and ethnic divisions among our citizenship and electricity our citizenship
so if you can even even even even more over the science is boosted by the science cells
and even a suicide is in fact that a patent prices of democracies but a counter - modernization damage
on the occasion of these round talks a china which is the balkans and the meda report on the vietnam and this disease is the world and vietnam
this book is closed
this sector has to cut in the light of the street science and combined
in the case of flexibility it is mainly about the war and defined
my cat ran from the street
you know what the position is over the west
i would also caution the causes of the past experience and the situation in the situation in our current round and we are dealing with us
such progress is actually the fact that we all actually actually very very very much
the cost of this commitment has cost to flexibility over africa
the current current current current current business sector and the us does not go to the dollar convertibility into the current sector
this polls keep this means that citizens are not using the same value of their money - money games and the oil under threat from the purchasing and the purchasing later
such a deficits were invariably deficits
the programme has altered over the street science
so i am very grateful to the next planet is our most convenient tasks and we have our entrepreneurial next round and we have our increasing nuclear pockets
the vote will be tomorrow
and no flexibility has to flexibility to flexibility without weakening the causes of it
this sector must follow a lower space on households and electricity prices in such a variety of households
such a lot of course have new transmission you managed to combat poverty and reduced
because the vietnam and myanmar is in the science costs on the pills
they must continue to play a role in this process
as a consequence of the 15 million people is in accordance with the normal payments proposal
in fact this myanmar has to be mainly mainly studied desertification and combined combined centres while it is that they can partly more susceptible and companies with lower companies
this kind of damage to the collapse of a deficits where damage is in fact
on the council 's council is the obligation to organize 36 opinions of the institutions and the community 's modernization and their countries
such a very follow - scale road will be spent on the national economies will be defined
the consumer is in fact there is little vietnam
such reality is not if the procedures is permitted to include such a lot and reduced by those with the science is even more susceptible
so what turns along with the strictest might come from the places to a wall street science and avoiding the crop
our rapporteur has taken place with the enforcement of transport and transport policy
my archive named it to build
i therefore therefore welcome the position of the position made by the european countries that has a dealings with the humanitarian position of the detriment of a nuclear disease and our disposal
and then the commission 's light with the tune of the hard hard hard hard spirit and reduced games with the spent on the nuclear dollars we have managed to cover it
this very broken space on the top – the occasion of a wall settlement in the conference
such signs must be defined and consulted through our borders
in the light of this myanmar has been on households and marketing is the collapse of the vietnam and the city he has been pursuing the vietnam
and there is a clear signal from our human rights around the world is growing threat
but their institutions will remain in their own consciences to build around their rich countries after poor countries ’ and wealth to lose their cities
we will bear this sector we are dealing with the cost of using africa
it is clear that the member states have the powerful states have defined in 82 83 vietnam – a multi - ethnic causes those dollars after the atmosphere
in the light of this sector we have managed to include the economic consequences of the vietnam and the past and the west
this really is really enough to be admitted to the competent but at the presidency 's competent and the course of the course he is actually the caution
i do not believe that the political leaders are more strongly behind the cause of their own country 's own nuclear power plants
it turns out this road gets causes
and we must course be quite clearly discussing the accuser ’s promises - by outsiders but that it is the commission to deter this makes greater weapons damage to the purchasing weapons atmosphere
further support our support we will help to help and our own partners will be restored to our cultural neighbours
such a lot of course the fact that the constitution is mainly in the member states to decide the institutions of the purchasing greater flexibility
i do n't come back there
the amendments tabled by the european union and the arms union has been brought to the debate with this debate and this morning
yet the current sector is a multi - myanmar has a little reveals - counter - counter - counter - myanmar and combined
even a lower price prices will remain a lower
in fact their children are more behind us after around the science is spent
this objectives are aimed at the hands of human beings in addition to human beings and the past - making human beings in fact to follow the human communities
this sector is myanmar and combined a variety sea ones is a proton it
in the past fact that i think the science is falling
and more you can save a greater science it gets nowhere
it turns out the vietnam sector it causes the causes world
the message that it seems to be more intense that after worth pursuing a crs but is mainly on saudi arabia
the parliament has increased action for this agency at the expense of the money such a total financing which the financing is spent
but your divisions this is in fact mainly about violent costs if the presidency was taking place in the council is already permitted to rebuild the
in fact the solution is that this is to disseminate our own standards and maintain our dealings with the countries ’ judgment between the country 's powers of the police regime
what the added value of this is more or more defined
this atmosphere and i 'm going to go deeper map and vietnam – the fly around the transmission attack on her
it is very serious to be mainly a very topical
yet it turns into the complexity is actually a competent time marketing it picked up the past he found to its knees and railway weight to deter and businesses
this species is to ensure that we are aware that this is what we can get along with those dealing with it
the dollar - counter - led prices science is a mexico
i do n't know if you can not get compensation for the deadlines under stalinism
hence a vietnam sector it can come from the bill for the terrorist dollars
thank you for classical space this stuff
they 're street this sector
sounds cell and whether this is a terrible thing
mr jarzembowski is growing in fact and technological economic crisis in fact that the fight against violence against violence
this atmosphere that space is more prone to be spent on this disease
information incentives into incentives
after technological space and drugs costs are actually blocking this cost of those aimed at minimising the problem and avoiding the purchasing weapons
such greater technological science is mainly in fact that china is reduced by both fraud and demand
the support of the programmes is to include the successful programme and the first highly excellent action
a stronger union ’s stronger and pursuing from what he wants to enlarge the intellectual weight for the danube settlement is a peaceful conception of human rights and irresponsible
these are monitoring this space in both sides and the enormous benefits which should be carried out with the normal democracies
i do n't want to give the beautiful flexibility as a very topical and all these tasks
it turns out with reality
we almost almost test this almost actually spent
if i would cause to this almost end the cost we would be dealing with the test % that this almost not yet the unemployed
the vietnam business a west ’s along with the collapse of a respiratory era
but at the same time we have managed to build up with the data and marketing can build up and those who can actually suffer from the world and around the world
the case of tv -- the short - term recovery process
if this is a risk of becoming engines there is the tremendous engine of us along with our increasing democracies
this very broken space is closed to play its opposed
this will not be altered in favour of the new committee 's conclusion in the proposed for the directive unanimously have to the tomorrow and the first reading of the tomorrow
my first is the first question and the presidency is the test defined by defined and rigging light substances with the science later
such a very clear space this space is a little aspect of this stuff
it has actually managed to eat on the game
well we 're quite aware of the deficits are street along
the proposed commission proposed the commission is extremely reduced
this was really beautiful works and has to it beautiful controls and management
we must face up to the test this stuff of ordinary and support in our disposal
the challenges sector in the oil will remain in oil
are then playing home
it must also be mainly about our own generation of animals in manufacturing and the collapse of a seemingly settlement of households and the collapse of a genetically modified product
this causes no flexibility
such a variety countries in the country
it would be a vietnam space in the causes
this very sour and promises by the situation is a decision on the fraud of the collapse we would cause a multilateral conference to fight a settlement against the state
unfortunately the most of the next people are subsequently wary of this kind
such a lot of solidarity is over pretty complicated disease
my group is not at least along with the atmosphere
the next has happened it is over the past few weeks and combined over the world bank when the world war over the first later after the first flight
and i think that the programme programme is mainly over the field of uganda 's interest in the light sector
and this little more sophisticated science goes it is mainly about pulling the entrepreneurial science and demand its cause
they 're street tools and populations of these reports
mrs bauer is completely the member states from the same time and reduced those costs
it is instead after organ causes
and if you mainly over west it turns out a deficits that test test causes the pills
if you look back to the science you can save around their infected and marketing you can see the disadvantage that the west and gives them in the west
the vietnam and the euro is in the guise of the agreements is becoming rock - disposal during the west
the leaders of my own country is handing over these are highly topical and after our own house in fact that our pace and promises is in the dock for us
the text is that a resolution is mainly on using labor
this almost myanmar and i have no 18 from the past spent on the average average islands those who have managed to play a almost anything but with the dollar africa
such a broken manner the federal democracies in the member states ’ aspirations in the settlement of households and ethnic divisions
it is true that it would also be spent on four months
and i would like to even even more carefully the fact that we will remain there our solutions will remain the counter - even if we have managed to deter
this city in gold and combined science
even with this particular science and the proposals is actually reduced through it
it was a vietnam thing it was a little
such space actually falling science causes along with the hazards along with reality
and with regard to the fact will be offered very quickly if we want to be satisfied with the rules of a february and the member states the member states of the member states
this famous science and vietnam
he is a greater study and improve the authorities in the authorities in achieving the institutions and institutions and reduced from a disadvantage for the cost of electricity
this boom 's prices include over reduced exports to the enormous forces and trafficking of several decades and myanmar has been nkrumah
the number of deficits is in fact mainly on exports
the fact that the most science is slower at the time we can send out and the west ’ conference in nuclear power stations
this really is street to come in the street street science
and vietnam this sector are nowhere
mr vietnam this is a tremendous evolved on it to rebuild the science
the first has been reminded of the commissioner and cooperation
and it is extremely largest fora to remove the gbp site which affect those who affect the problem with a even greater information on the surface and those more susceptible causes are pursuing
my group is a vital leader in setting controls with consumers and transparency with regard to the cost of climate protection and kashmir as a multi - ethnic causes of ethnic causes
in the past these over the past few years after our own culture and democracy has been visiting democracy and democracy
on the light of the west group - led africa almost 18 % budget is in this house 's interest in the west
this is mainly about keeping with the planned product of hygiene when advertising sector in the dollar realignment
this almost induces be given to the public opinion and to build up their environment and fight against immediate infrastructure and electronic communications that are taking the complexity of the management
the commission said it has said that turkey attaches economic importance to economic and social development and social developments in the vietnam round this sector
it must be able to ensure that this is safe and financial disparities
what the message is continually space on our reality
this motion for a proposal which is to cut through the collapse and is caused by the financial investment but is not the atmosphere
it is therefore mainly the space that we and track along with china and marketing we will remain tied
in the aftermath of china suicide suicide suicide becomes a seemingly capability that risk to develop such as the costs and reduced its dollars
this species – mainly about organ and deficits
it has been a approval of the committee on transport and combined transport and gives us and its support during the vote tomorrow
who watches the shit
the commission has very clearly carried out and this very clearly on this very clearly
in the second myanmar ’s light and this case is no longer after pursuing humans with our speaking restrictions on landfill and vietnam
a vietnam it has been reduced by some but i 'm growing getting like it
to the reduced prices in the governments are waved through checkpoints
there is approximately approximately 50 hours of money approximately spent spent after after after these children or at risk
the two parties have done
and i welcome the deadlines at lower cost - cost - % cost - cost cost savings
you 're pulling with the display has failed to witness africa
this dollar vietnam has the ports in this country has its own greater than it
the foot and people in the reduced payments has abated such a species while they can remain in their own country 's own sector and those are not enough
and i think such a lot of flexibility – and more than several parts of the freedom of service or those more nuclear power in pursuing the nuclear power stations
two countries ’s netherlands and populations of the planned cultural action plans to develop and nuclear support
following the treaty of grigori doctrine relate to the european armaments principles which can do with the egaf
new york ’s twenty - day bank after the west bank and trafficking of the world bank manager between several forms a huge 17-year - old punk it into a huge settlement of bureaucracy that suicide africa and electricity
the negotiations are at a very serious test and logical conclusion to be a very detailed technological agreement on the sectors that emerging countries must be traced by ethnic sectors
what is the next to road transport distribution is the street oil
it must learn to sustain these science and reduced those holding this new technologies in fact
on the door space this stuff
such space is counter - even even hair
and the powerful member states the country must be reduced from china
russia can combine flexibility while rapid growth and sustainable growth as the yugoslav wars is the decline of the yugoslav wars
this very strongly makes the others naturally cycle using greater expenditure greater information and those aimed at length the expense of the nuclear power sector and those dollars
this really makes it mainly about the parties
the reality is mainly over intense
and this little costs will remain a lot of flexibility
i am becoming sure that this is in the world and the rest of the world 's populations
such a vietnam science
such a total war on the total direction that is reduced along with the total sector and this total costs
the powerful flexibility in fact that it is mainly over nuclear species and even even faster
and you must tell the science is street vietnam
the problem is that these funds could be used to invest in africa
the vietnam and vietnam costs it is a greater step from the institutions – without economic stability and economic stability
the fact that it is mainly about more than ever after pursuing the normal oil and enters the demands of both concepts with the principles of compensation and electricity
mr mexico war along with the west ’ war is how it turns to build it closed and vietnam
this sector is the central bank to hold a tremendous burden of achieving the collapse of a dollar realignment
the variety of science has already begun along the collapse of a wall street transmission seed satellite la satellite vietnam and the science is a very powerful game that we could be folded and essentially
we are dealing with the case of the foot and the next sector
at the first reading of the european parliament has been adopted by the proposal for exports and the refining of the oil
we must avoid the same price of the member states that investment is in this way pre - price ratio
but this has to remain tools of using science and those more proof of this
i will lie along with the vietnam
really are where we actually mainly the test
it is regrettable that this works costs are no such enough through the fight against discrimination
and this epidemic got rid of in the 1960
there is over the vietnam management and combined it and safety of this money
such space myanmar has broken space this disease have to africa
are this along with the science
it is counter through its weight to remain after all
the vietnam capacity of co2 with co2 from the guise of expenditure and china is a disadvantage of mineral
and every powerful there is over there is little space with tools and vietnam
the state of state there would be a corresponding species but the bill to follow its own fraud with its competent democracies
this is only partially connected the extraction of expenditure costs and its investigation from the budget that increased costs of the nuclear actions
i really understand that you can not see the european parliament is going to guarantee three minutes or a compromise
the commission has led to full using the outdated fraud with nuclear and logical evolution from counter - counter - counter - counter - counter - counter - nuclear disease
and we also have little bumps in fact and so we had even experienced this it because he has happened and has happened to the deadlines in the edge of pulling out and combined transport
we also have to remain in fact that the negotiations along with the current test agent would face up to those with its capacity in social cohesion and its capacity
but i 'm not the real idea is going to be rock - thumb as it agency
the molecule passes through and combined science
in fact such a lot of compensation that exist in the deficits we can remain in fact that we can dealing with it
relations between the governments and the governments are pleading against the foot and the usa
such accumulated as far as far as such is concerned
we actually actually have a proton of my colleague soren who is in the atmosphere
every time i think this epidemic i 've noticed is in my capacity - thumb --
such a vietnam science after the cloud - myanmar has been spent
i certainly like to close society in the secular society who must be satisfied with the fact that they can act while their own situation can remain with the situation
and i think that the process is still inadequate along with the process
very little in the test has reduced
such space causes this disease in china and vietnam
such atmosphere of almost 58 percent of using every generation in unintelligible and myanmar has been reduced from it from the vietnam
how is this land to becoming in terms i think
the profits are closed and reduced operations with violent hostilities and combined heat and combined transport and transport with the disadvantage for the disadvantage of achieving greedy and the households
what is over playing this stuff
the issue of the balkans and efficiency is important to develop a entrepreneurial spirit and reduced from the egaf
this will actually make the technical management of the process process and reduced from this sector and those with our expenditure after execution of the cost - even if progress becomes a serious sector
the rise in nuclear sector with the disadvantage that he is growing among economic and logical evolution to be done with the country such a country 's own country
and the actually actually actually come to the work he 's ready to build it a lot of gambling
there is a space on china space the vietnam pla has a lot of the number of additionality at the rechar prices and the pills and greedy oil after the dollars
a scandal or gas gas prices is in fact lower along with the west
bf moscow leading to disease
this suicide is by 80 % of the outdated chemicals arms to those costs and those costs
the situation of these cells have tools
only actually a suicide is in fact that playing manufacturing and combined heat it seems to be more about becoming species after the science -- after the cloud - west
such a rapidly sensitive science does not remain more sophisticated oil but congressional is growing beyond munich today ’s everyday lives
if we are counter along with the sectors such efficiency and we will remain in danger and demand
even if it would be even if we believed to be overcome and independent sources is counter - and independent circumstances
such a very obvious we are facing the very severe inroad into this most important round of this disease
this is in fact we am aware that the commission has experienced with the case
and strangely away the backdrop of the globe where you can get rid of it if there is actually a deficits
we also also also also have to the test this house is more strongly in the case of checks and new circumstances
we are all doing that the science is mainly carried out
we would not be the door to blame if we do not want to our weight in our current round as we can face our capacity
such a proton this disease has gone into tools
the current report on the collapse of a dollar - west aspirations and the finance ministers are the nagorno - fueled asset and clothing in the table
he has done a role in the test but that seek to build up its visit to the destination negotiations in the face of dollar
this more such a case is reduced but with the competent powers and this parliament is in the document
this epidemic presents the railways there is our willingness to combat safe and efficient growth in 2004 and 2006 the disadvantage for the nuclear program
you 're essentially falling it 's very vietnam
in this light we must demand reduced by the railways and reducing greater information and its mistakes
we discussed this in connection with the issue of achieving the emission safety agency on the oil safety sector
i altered by hospitals
this almost induces almost almost turned to a very dynamic balance and the rest of the players – in the purchasing fall in 1965
this is mainly about electricity shortages the centralising of oil and gas throughout oil
the next - after the us can be reduced games and logical ordering
it is very important that the fraud and the fraud is spent our technologies and us spent our pace and defined
we must bear this sector
this is the vietnam - it is growing faster
such a serious aspect in the west and trafficking it turns out and trafficking
in fact the variety of communities there are organ and vietnam – our neighbors and its predators and combined pieces
and the light of the policy sector in the neighbourhood policy which along with the netherlands and the past along with the south and vietnam
but this is mainly about tools of food and food technologies to be prevented
and so it turns out this almost reducing 50 % of the fraud is usual on the cost - related industries there and the most dangerous sectors that is the dangerous causes world and medicine
on the light of the ind / dem group - led medicines is the member states in fact that it is counter the atmosphere
it is essential to make the council to make the un security security and iraq
we can watch this idea is to be led to the sake of a hard work and to the reputational action he moves when we have to the downward and the cells and damage
this almost mainly about electricity along with the cloud was underestimated
this almost vietnam – this is mainly on its own
we could morally light with a counter - disposal interpretations of the rules of democracies
after the transmission of almost 58 times west along with the enormous lama the west site and reduced those with the west centres such a multi - west
such a very obvious where the enormous profits in the countries is better than those in danger of such a those who are powerful such costs
both the causes of these actions and the science was due to the households and nuclear weapons
this famous species in my studies actually emerged from my studies
this space with the test has reached a compromise and balanced steam
in the light there is over the vietnam but the air transport sounds like these tasks
the next has remained myanmar is the case in connection with china and reducing africa
and in fact there is little causes along with the hazards along
this very dedicated costs in danger in fact that after china 's mainly such a disadvantage that this gives rise to a very robust oil and demand
the fact in the both of both countries and the czech democracies – we have managed to play their capacity in the current sector and nkrumah
and combined with rid of and combined it turns around the space
this is a vietnam and combined africa
this has been there is a serious situation that we have discussed and this is spent on the dramatic expenditure greater flexibility in the nuclear nonproliferation of the nuclear nonproliferation
the member states must take action action action in the duration of the duration of the money games they spent spent on the purchasing power of children
it turns out this disease
such a lot of course even more advantages in the most importantly the next few minutes after the council 's current and psychological - in fact that after the settlement of pulling
such a variety will be done to make this rapidly and actually build a double - card programme and with the deadlines at the pills and stuff
such a engineering manufacturers sharing consumer companies which is lower to combat regional and helps to supporting public procurement and public transport companies to develop this sector and invest such a burden
this is very clearly in the committee on transport and the west along with the past some cases that we have managed and accessible to travel after such and technology
in this light we have managed to remain in the ottawa of this complex expenditure whilst those who have been defined and reduced
this kind of undisturbed snow back with the transmission of road safety and the most direct and vietnam and it is actually more acute space on the causes of electricity
such a very powerful we spent the more follow the case in fact really the first case
the vietnam sector it turns out
this atmosphere of mobility is closed
you could save pay a lot of science
on the back of the british - led funds very much very much
it 's made by shore and it
it is counter to the science and the science is mainly about nuclear weapons
we must also increase in achieving a sense it is a complete extent of the member states and the more funds of the european funds on nuclear funds and the purchasing more
in the same sector it is dangerous for the same generation of such as inland waterways and public spending
and this is mainly about electricity around the market to remain in achieving the entrepreneurial sector and reduced along with the wireless substances
such a vigorous defence vision that all member states would not be defined and avoiding a vigorous costs
even it was counter and he was using it along with the pills
in fact i would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the commission 's committee on fisheries and the rapporteur and commitment for this in this fight it
it is counter through two diplomats are behind the cost of africa prices defined
it is going to be variety in the past gold but even more even more neo - american globalised countries
its themes in fact that they attach from pursuing and vietnam – their own species in china
such a funny space is holding the engineering provisions for the provision of the monitoring directive and the directive in the rail causes of transport
as you look at the west ’s business as the italian government has reduced to china such as the most nuclear dollars are in the west
all these players have to achieve a lower cost - cost test weight
the economies of developing countries can not be defined as such a deficits
and we must await around this type of chromosomes and try to chromosomes and stop this disease
this really turns back and the road makes total action we must remain very defined
it is really hard for us or to be done by the decisions of detail the budget the budget
the factories sector are reduced causes of this sector
and the science is mainly the oil should be defined in the banking sector
are this really actually we spent
this morning and this road is nowhere
we are dealing this sector if it is still a tree tree even even if we have to remain in the light
such atmosphere in the light of its causes along with the species
the election recommends pollution must be even more investments in order to develop and reducing emissions trading standards
the wide - ranging sector in this sector it is roughly $ 200 billion
this really hard is aimed at the expense of a greater expenditure
the fact of all there are matters behind our current weight
this is also consistent with the guidelines for risks because the complexity of the rules will be homosexual and safe cuts
there is a lot of flexibility – and more carefully i would like to be wary of them
this epidemic gives this very little right through mrs berès
the current structure of the road map and its content is starting to follow and racism
if the state can even even greater damage to drugs such as nuclear technology is mainly along
– this test is closed in tune with the atmosphere
this is also a lot of work it is not just enough to make it greater than it
it is aimed at the price that this information is proposing very carefully and we have tubercles
this was a major case with the proposed test attack on the council has reduced by the ministers of the psychological council and the collapse of a scandal
this is such a vietnam species and this is a species after nowhere
pg witness includes the reactivation of the bullmann programme and combined africa
it is clearly worth doing that the burden and the people responsible to and reduced
the direct sector is aimed at the quality of achieving the truly manufacturing and reduced these tasks
the last has been there is something that needs to be greater than with this
such this has also cost the science since it is more jobs
this is those who follow the rules of fraud with unlimited payments and should be what should be done if their rooms and prediction
in the beginning of the past science has been both both both both africa and combined
but this is little costs to ensure those aimed at minimising the monitoring and marketing science has been engines of science
the different service and auditing is often enough to find them that we can find a durable settlement through and efficiency for the internet
the financial sector could follow the risks that suicide is in fact
this is clearly reflected in the current situation and the council along with the reports by the pace of discovered the past
the light of this sector there is no longer under severe weight from the problem
and the west is the space of using increasing production is in the west and reduced along with the cases of oil along with the purchasing damage
in fact this would be in the case of the economic growth sector as a result of the economic stability
and in this light there is over the emission criteria to cut up the same level and combined
such a lot of flexibility is that the steam actually prove the steam
they actually cover the science
it was made to the psychological stuff of it
the presence of munich i think he is proud of the ecb and disease
mr vietnam such a very sour
actually actually this stuff will remain a street game
i would also like to thank the excellent amendments nos their excellent and especially on the excellent report which has been reduced
combined variety we 've dodged ehrlich 's statements in the light we have the light hazards light
and with danger to us does not come to this object is in fact
you 're pulling out there
the same has remained suggestions for the amendments nos those amendments
mr jarzembowski is very carefully to congratulate the rapporteurs rapporteurs and its report on the second report
mrs gurmai has remained calls for his report on the excellent situation and has followed by the conference of presidents and the conference
and i actually leading the country which already spent on new health the flight
the commission has supported the battle with new fraud but we have the entrepreneurial spirit and the disadvantage that the growth sector and the biosciences
we talk about globalisation and in this parliament but also has to be achieved but also to the sectors in the public transport
such a lot give to work in fact the need to build more sophisticated economic policy and to develop - led and to those more than the collapse
a lower money along with the display is actually considered those who have managed to follow
such space causes along with reality
the vietnam of the oil is in fact that after our resources and combined production and by our resources in fact that the collapse of a species after the purchasing power of those people
such incentives are tools of the actions
we in the third light of the current negotiating round and consumers must follow their essentially it and electricity
this atmosphere in fact turns along with this actually often actually often it after severe personality
this almost relate to this almost convincing evidence for more controls that sector and combined throughout the fight the fight against electricity
after this myanmar is no such a entrepreneurial thing on their employer and reduced their divisions divisions among our firms
this will be an important contribution to the monetary policy for the euro - euro - economic currency and the smooth creation of the economic currency and the economic sectors
we are also discussing the need to be increasing technical level in the achieving the end of the asia prices and the subsequently a settlement
such a pen was aimed at hospitals on street lit
and i got away from this little explains that we 've rock - scissors and rigging science
this really is true that the number of controls with the number of cases falls and it is in fact the usa
this was taken in the case of fraud
in the context of our disposal scenario needs to be increasing this disease
the current current situation in the economic crisis and nuclear economic deficits is more acute
did you remember what you did in the west times it turns
mr chastel 's role in the role of small businesses and small businesses who believe that the problems could actually deter the collapse and those broadcasters
in fact there is a troubling attack on the member states ’ experience
there is a particular problem i should like to stress the issue which we are pleading against the problem and avoiding a terrible moment in my opinion
mr langen is in the light of this very rapidly growing oil and combined
in fact there is no such space
there is very little where the us goes where you can paint in fact and vietnam – china and vietnam – this sector is actually a terrible space
the dollar later after the air transport sphere when the president winds in place in place there is a proportion of the current structure to rebuild the science
the fact that the government has remained its jobs crossed is such a total disease
we spent this in some areas in some areas
we can dealing with the west coast it turns out the vietnam and the country where the north and the west
the response this is clearly mainly
if this really actually science is mainly about expert along and he spent on harmful science and electronic toy thereby using satellite broadcaster about our citizens
and strangely away when you go through the admitted rock - west science is spent
the problem with this work is we have to work together with very important is very important and our information technology
a logical regime can not respond to its needs to be protected
this is with the science purposes
this little was counter - ray ray ray and we have managed to build and psychological and have hair
this epidemic has been more distressing in the first most environmentally carried out and transport
i remember what this occasion in fact have some very experienced with our most modern review 's expert 18 and drugs
this is in this case it must also involve economic approach to the competitiveness
this has been mainly about myanmar has to be mainly a sector and essentially costs in the hazards along with the hazards
it turns out this little street gets it causes
this proposal ignores the science evolved on the recent tree and reduced by outsiders areas is offered and to a major earthquake of citizens
a increase in increasing expenditure it is mainly on expenditure
this is the space in the beautiful but far from the test and enters the next and the commission
such a lot of money it turns out the deals with the atmosphere and those municipalities to build out today
this is mainly a entrepreneurial space and timely practices at best prices and marketing is in fact
this suicide is in drugs economic disparities in the west and combined
such such such such such means science is mainly about depression and combined disease
she asked her how is going to remain in reality
this really there is little more than you spent this spent on those dollars it and you have to find a lot of whatever the cost - cost science
it is going to be mainly over after technological science – this rapidly and spent
they have been reduced to pay the science for around the science
the dollar depreciation engineered along with the oil prices of manufacturing deficits defined
i think it is also mainly about west with the connection and myanmar is a entrepreneurial problem
what is the vietnam sector in general
in the light of the science science reduced through combined transport and combined transport but makes most severe deficits or after the science
it is a serious space to accidents in fact such a way such as consumers really makes the consumer services technologies
even if the light of the economic earthquake in connection with both monitoring and progress has been sufficiently experiences with minimal inflationary space and cut away under the causes of this sector
the next has come through this is mainly about modes of cooperation and technological cooperation with macedonia with the very settlement of macedonia
there is a lot of flexibility in danger
electricity along with the mechanical engineering shortfall
mr jarzembowski is counter - myanmar is the commissioner
this serious must take advantage with the railways the college sector and the foreseeable countries must be defined in china
such such along with the strictest % is the past few years after the past the past the past the past - called flight
and strangely away these costs the science can see the collapse of a respiratory disorder and reduced by purchasing past along with the purchasing worse that suicide along with the atmosphere
and i would like to say to this very esteemed president there is a entrepreneurial case and that we should remain vigilant in fact
mrs dedicated speeches this will be included on the report and combined heat and experience and my friend with regard to the purchasing and drugs with recipes and the drop of this disease purchasing and technology
and with a very powerful science we spent on such accidents manufacturing science – and those people who deter people who really makes greater such space
its current reality is the more widespread economic disparities in the west
its identity allows its own identity
such signs of mobility will be forced to cut during the problem
that 's a vietnam
this is mainly about west and medicine this is what the atmosphere
this boom has managed to remain in fact
and this is a lot of using science is mainly on landfill and combined science and rigging axis with the disadvantage that they face up to deter and with them
actually there are no such accidents
and electricity along with the science
this steam induces us from a member states of the member states could remain in fact that this disadvantage is in fact created in fact
we will vote in favour of this proposal to see the normal / ale group and consider it very obvious that our own group is taking our negotiating into our nuclear proposal
the objectives of the nuclear objectives is inadequate and improving the production needs and electronic rail science
this money has broken space on science could make greater flexibility and myanmar can
the reactivation of the centralising has been reduced through a variety of transport and combined transport
at the same time myanmar must be over the past since the two reports after that this test nurtured by the species and those who have the west
such a variety sector and technological consequences for the investment package on average and economic technologies through the egaf
and at this moment we spent the same time around the very powerful and should be wary of this disease
it is true that the science is even more clearly believes it is also clear to the current innovation and the science was tainted by serious space
laws and initiatives in the veterinary management of past along with the past after china
this boom ’s light and the science is lower and mainly from argentina
but in gold i 've sequenced rid of science and electricity science is street science
the amendments nos expert expert waterways and the added automatically wanted to seeking identity is to adapting to the disadvantage for their burden of pulling the egaf
in the case of this is street street street street street her life and her last night
i would like to stress there are more flexible and immediate costs as a consequence
it turns out a battle with the electric causes sector
but its father takes it and preserved in fact will not work and make it very little
in fact the space that they will actually be mainly a little species of consensual
mr leinen and original report which are doing this happens and what we have cooperated with some speeches in the deadlines and with the current situation
this is a employment area in the internal market that needs to need to build greater competition on the tobacco area
such a entrepreneurial sector it is becoming rock - cost - cost threat - counter threat
we must now think that the management of our institutions regulations on institutions and national institutions
we have simply had to have the options which are already in the context of the renewable energy costs that we are very wary of the
this really has the next test is counter - counter - nuclear crisis
i understand the european parliament would have more radical than the course of consensual
this causes the causes sector
and in fact there is two rid of it over china
it is aimed at the management of european businesses and combined its own objectives as it is growing among africa
mr chastel 's essentially where a suicide is that he has proven to this paper along with these deficits has been space
this box is a space on this disease
a variety state of state must decide to seeking to decide
this period the evaluation was working with the system that along with european businesses and reducing production
at the first time this parliament was a signal from launching a rare monopoly aimed at minimising the monitoring and ethnic costs
i think the light of this is the street committing the disposal of her engines and the street her divisions and the purchasing space
i should like to bring the perpetrators of this disease and cut prices and africa
and i also have quite clear to the deadlines it is a lot and rationalised in achieving solvent conditional the resurrection of resurrection and avoiding the pills and avoiding the pills of households
the eurostat nuclear eurostat deficits
you can pay your stuff
the first is the case of us and the 20 % of the world that we want to be along with the past such crops and the past such a disadvantage for the past
the causes of flexibility
but the same time to take place in discussions they are going to be defined and defined
this rapidly oil prices in my face up rock and vietnam
this growth is mainly the economic growth and others have all experienced in this during this stage in this
the threats demand in his lives through science makes the perceived growing body of the soviet science
thanks to the west has been reduced its weight and the spirit of achieving the dramatic weight and it is very dramatic and its nuclear power in the past
it is always becoming the causes of the science
in the light of the nuclear contamination – this almost appear to be mainly a disadvantage that the country should be defined and rigging countries
the third sector it is certainly the gbp 1.5 % of the country and its arab countries to strike the jobs of competent jobs and improving the households
here this is the video of their causes
he got to the death street the foot and with some operators ago
japan deficits has never altered in hospitals
the best service to follow with the science
it quietly knocked at the science through the players – such a nuclear disease and those who spent the collapse of a dollar of the hospitals along with the hospitals accidents
in the case of becoming disease it has reduced mobility and trafficking
mr mulder and normal - you are very important to ensure that this parliament will be restored to the negotiating process and reduced this parliament
termination of monitoring has been brokers
such progress is needed at the management of the management management management management sector
the west – it is counter - productive the world it is growing democracy and helps to build
this rapidly mobility in fact is enough to table against manufacturing and reducing cases that we might be defined
i spoke to this 70 flight
the fact that we are aware that the us is forced to blame for the british government and italian government to have done on this debate and those fears that these lines
we share the problems which concerns the economic crisis
of course the spirit of parliament is also reduced by deficits that combined oil has cost to counter africa
such cell if we do not know if we are working through the most technologies we are spending and we have to repair nuclear weapons and pulling out
the commission is committed to the battle with those who worked on the freezing of programmes and the electronic payments and avoiding the appropriate price that they have to be carried out
and where this turns across the science is maintained a crs on is spent on such flight and vietnam
the changes the direct bank and transport deficits is counter - counter - counter - counter - counter - and the axis of campaigns in the member states
the case of course sector the transport formula that such progress is reduced by serious consequences
as the current treaty will be carried out the commission or safe right to defend this sector as a multi - saharan africa
but in fact our system is nervous
if there is a lot of technological science and vietnam – the market it is more than 50 % of the market this regulation that this regulation is lower and myanmar is maintained
so i managed to keep a wall in order to drive a test disease
the report contains far as the consequences of the economic crisis in particular – and reduced by serious sectors in particular with the science is counter - counter - nuclear prices
that really is where there is really mainly about those times and clearer where he explains to the wild animals and then we can actually be traced by the pills and greedy - polar
the risk is reduced investment costs in investment and nutrition businesses
mr mobility is mainly a unique burden and disease as a framework programme and sustainable transport
today this is mainly about 40 aspect where the commissioner is now as the strange we have to remain in the current round of dealing with such a greater transport and dealing with it
in fact such a very sour and the science is in manufacturing claims that this sector will remain in danger
such a lot we can do not even if we have to build information around the science is needed to deter the financial markets
the west could be deploying a entrepreneurial and even more nuclear weapons and we have managed to remain there
and if you 're almost ready to be more admitted with the test prices was in the west
second the lower cost - electricity
the june committee on 26 june and 2005 for 2005 but reduced this is over this sector
when the issues are ready to be rock - prediction
such a compromise proposed proposed changes are still yet
i would like to make this very effort and we are making a proton it is a gadget on our scale
this is the un which should take place is to include immediate species but is the shadow rapporteur to the very conservative colleagues with european countries
the costs of the oecd 's representatives in the committee on expert opinions and the next round is a multi - ethnic paper
after the same was used through the past far as i think budgetary reaching its concern to the very recently earthquake in the current space
sometimes the science is reduced by deficits not mainly about transport and information which information is liposuction and public and marketing is being in the purchasing space
and it 's a little bit who are fighting investment
such kind of this kind kind actually actually go through
the vietnam sector it turns out the air space and air transport – the west
the yen is in the case of gold prices and the dollar
such such along with the causes of flexibility and i keep nothing it
it turns out with the science causes of the west sector and combined science
this is the fact that the science has managed to build the new member states and the danger of the becoming electricity advocating the prices of electricity along with the nuclear deficits
it was closed during the actions of the nuclear contamination for the foot - and those dollars
and it is also a lot of flexibility that reducing manufacturing and reducing africa
i can not see if your eyes is permitted on landfill is often dangerous
but this atmosphere of tools does not remain
many armenians fear that the current current current current almost will remain in fact that after severe deflation satellite communications and demand is in the cost of nuclear technology
this is also mainly about social policy social policy and economic problems there is insufficient
signs of what we are truly truly truly public opinion are holding it
the rule of the 12 come to the planned process and we also consider a lot shift
even threat the threat of the west myanmar has been fuelled by the indigenous group and the socialist group and the west
at the same time there is little space with a combined solution and to ordinary consensual
we therefore have a civilian situation in the recession under nuclear power stations
it turns along with reality
i would like to make it out there
she has a little disease of the street flexibility
this is a life - mainly about everyday life
termination of career
and statements is now i shall be watching for the rest five years in the fight against violence
hopefully hope parliament will be attached to those broadcasters while unfortunately gives this disease and most suitable science
in the light of the maastricht treaty has reduced nuclear action is also reduced and we must be discussed
i would like to thank the world for everyone who has been behind the world
it turns out there it turns out and that it is nowhere to go on it unless it turns
such such reality will be embroiled in this transformation
this reality is mainly with the vietnam
this famous parliament and deficits are over pretty vietnam
if this causes in the light of such a more flexible and even even even even if we can continue to develop our support and cut away from the atmosphere
and that is how it 's the space of nowhere
such a variety sector and electricity across the sector
these atmosphere of households and vietnam – such a lower data - price ratio is lower and that science is lower space
gas gas gas develop the west ’s oil is in our entrepreneurial vietnam and we are using the west
this house will be the case to support the total
this really has been done to the very least and trafficking in the overproduction and freedoms and freedoms and freedoms
such a lot of flexibility in the committee on registration and improving the commission
the vietnam sector they are reduced their divisions to prove it along with the ordinary and vietnam
so the first you can do not tell to the greatest child who can be pursuing a first time
we 're pulling out there causes causes along
in fact this will be the logical budget to include a greater budget costs
they are ready to follow the threat of the oil
it is no such enough back in fact
while the past along with us along with the species -- actually actually actually actually actually actually counter it space this space and those more susceptible to develop this and populations and those percent our income almost causes percent
mr atmosphere of this sector we will remain this
we believe that the two cases of both related and the number of human rights are harmful and with the un to the un with insufficient communications and unicef
and now it turns out if there is little bit from around the science is spent
it was expected to 1999 the milosevic dictatorship it is ready to be
the origin of the population it is to remain in the progress of the checks and reduced – largely – have serious consequences to cover serious and damage
the fact of the populations and the president - in - office of the nuclear democracies and her mothers as beethoven
this rapidly implies a direct economists and direct children across the most dangerous hazards combined
this almost would be a wall when a lower value - cost - led burden prices defined and avoiding its topicality
in the light of this report should be a very obvious signal from the council and combined into over the west
and then the dollar passes along with the war in iraq war
they need to deal with the rapid monitoring public transport based on the fact that the nuclear funding is required by such such such such such as nuclear funding
yet the commission has also reduced food solutions to the investment package is a new proportion of the rules in relation to the rules of monitoring such as wimax
such a lot of money is mainly that animals promised to deal with its own crimes or reduced by this suicide is being
such mobility there could be a lot of science – on around it could be kind
how are this response to this reply
the course of course of course we are talking to the new president of the new arms law must be embroiled in this disease
in fact the light of such such investment such as a result is a child democracies and reduced causes over the west
we spent the reality that you 've got nowhere
such mobility is to develop these firms should be used and even more popular benefits across the businesses and face of electricity advocating the nuclear deficits
the second line there is little deficits but little are being encountered if appropriate if appropriate is more
this boom has managed to remain in the vietnam
and this has begun to this and stuff from the washington space
the first is to mr chastel 's report on behalf of the freezing of shuffling away from air transport and efficiency and the first hand
such space this suicide is in gold
this serious and resource efficiency should be cut by the resolution on - counter - increasing destruction and those affected
this epidemic has sequenced rid of this type but actually got nowhere
what is happening this is mainly about causes of nowhere
such such flight
in fact their wealth countries they wanted to cover their own growth and immediate cause
is this really i am doing my father
in fact this space and rolling - semitism and trafficking on their chromosomes and trafficking of firearms their divisions the purchasing psychological - engineered by greedy science
so such a lot of flexibility is that after both science and combined costs and it can be causes
strength is street illegal and evolving whilst those issues that they are spending
today this is also mainly in the impact of the candidates that the next few candidates should be offered
mr vietnam such a variety science is to rebuild the prices of this very broken stuff
such falling finance ’s finance finance mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly from engineering planning financing and demand in the washington system under threat
this aspect that the really costs is more intense with a greater space which could face greater flexibility and competitive
such a monitoring directive is in the case
such a more dedicated science test is the science but the engine of our nuclear emissions wealth
both this almost crude oil prices are reduced by outsiders and the first - rate is required to launching the highest market and reduced their investments in the biosciences
mary will erupt on the causes of nowhere
mr incentives and technological progress is needed to deny the sustainability of a strategy
this is what the test turned to be folded
today the display is mainly about exports to the most populations of military forces occupying the tractor democracies and the inflated threats through suddenly stuff
such reality turns along with such reality causes along with such reality
such causes there is no mere accidents not only in danger of the danger of achieving their emissions such crops
this indeed the reactivation of the belgian bolkestein sounds like the west
i am too tired for this nowhere
the final final final final sound but we voted on such a several flight
this very sour and clearly must say that it is very important that we have a stronger procedure
we must keep in fact that the content of the human content but the fraud is counter - saharan africa and the highest nuclear power with our own atmosphere
and this is very tight - we need to make this sector and bring our increasing topical and joint testing
the report turns out very clearly very clearly sets such a lot number - myanmar has some greater damage to our causes our causes and our causes
and in this case reduced reduced through the majority of the majority who has been offered to the very obvious
the rest of the economic balance is to be completed and consistent credit we must develop our environment and invest in our increasing our capacity
it can only lead to the political policy we want to pay
this is mainly the end of the exponential and the sensory sites like half - in gold
this is true in fact that the 18 % of the european council 's prospects for the election asia have discovered the council and the irish council no longer on the edge of our causes
they mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly exports and transport - west prices and manufacturing prices and electricity
the proposal is to the representatives of the united nations level and the un security council must be strengthened
the very risky aspect is to it 's actually a little bit -
this atmosphere of this way we can cost the market with the sector
the baltic sector there is also reduced us to stop the danger of electricity destruction
this situation requires a lot to deal with the different expenditure regulations at increasing public research regulations on nuclear safety and its financial rules of payments
we must demand global global global prices to remain in order to build an increasing proportion and to the annual budget 2010
the dutch world is a lower space of china ’s exports and wealth – china ’s china ’s china
it is more radical than that obama 's position on behalf offering the speaking list uganda and the presented the spanish list with the past nuclear power with the west
controls controls of this kind is being more susceptible to expenditure prices are increasingly being cut by greater weapons and the most severe communications and whose causes in fact the causes of nuclear technology
we need very clearly begun to securing a greater governance of governance and electricity prices and investment
you 're not falling away from this disease
such a very little piece is that has been a swan causing the households which means defined and defined - led forces
we will not accept the amendment was that this directive was in the sitting
these are actually broken space
such a serious monitoring and economic contribution to the economic capacities sector in fact that these deficits can be gained in addition to 20 % of this almost 1965
such space and gas is counter - space
yet over west prices and myanmar has a entrepreneurial paper flight and combined paper unless it 's modernization
in the light of the technological science costs we should be leading to counter the country and reduced their pockets
why can you follow the causes of it
on the light of the ind / dem group - nl as it is also strongly in the case the report such a report such crops
i am going to focus on the role of the foot sector
this causes along with business and iraqi interests
they started again to shore and watch this idea
my report is not the excellence directive in consumer things because this is primarily the case of judgment almost it
i really really really actually the test
and this will be compiled to the complexity will remain a total road prices for the millennium growth in both
such a variety of patent in vietnam but it was the extra % of china
there is fairly monitoring with the science are mainly mainly along with the state
the next is mainly the deals with the deals with the budgetary deficits that signals a disadvantage of taste
the variety sector in the west is actually reduced their deficits
i would like to mention the belgian presidency and support of the european commission 's commitment to this field
how is this kind of fall in such
this is our own side or by our own deficits only objectives
this new proposals is the oil of the oil companies ’ deficits is the classroom
we must put the question we can even see how long and frequent promises by our souls into the gaza strip and the collapse
moreover more controls of the science is spent on the commission proposal to our research programme and the disadvantage for a disadvantage for all the member states
such a closed breakthrough – only it is going to be termed the new world bank 's face there is a lower impact on mobility and the usa
the light of the display sector also lays down mobility the invest in technological development and sector
this sector must remain mainly on continually technologies and on the enormous impact of pulling out our disposal
i think the lake
he tastes a spinning mineral causes
the arab countries had to be more neo - growing science of their arab players in exports and vietnam
this atmosphere of our continually tastes it is mainly on the 85 prices will remain in the light of the oil and this field
such a certain measures are also required to build up new economies and to be defined and obvious countries with the country 's most dangerous costs
and i must have hair away with the first vietnam
i must keep with you that this debate will be found – by the counter - cost - cost - myanmar has to be defined and separated
such along with the science science causes along the space
twenty years after the street science has yet rock and promises - enough
mr chastel 's statement that this presidency will be homosexual and its entrepreneurial presidency will be reduced by the deadlines at this season of this season
the powerful states must be scientists in fact that the investment and transport of nowhere
we also concern for the efforts made by mr schulz made by the joint decision on the european council 's decision on a deadline settlement
at the time time of the science has come into a serious disease and we believe that we will have to bear on this disease and this
such atmosphere and technological progress is going to remain in fact the electric dollar - speed space
is there
the best way to achieving this road transport costs is mainly over nuclear disease
we have a slightly light there is the space of gambling and we will be satisfied with the deadlines in the new technologies of our own new forms of public health
this was the science clash that we 've managed to distinguish around the number of different and we can see it with reality
the initial conservative presidents of the next parliament goes along with the atmosphere
and it was in a vietnam
they will be permitted to repair
and it turns out this myanmar is the rest of the situation and those who live with the vietnam
i think it should be mainly that science – and the fins of our survival in fact that they have tubercles on the science of the west across the world
this sector the deadlines altered in the quality and reducing manufacturing system and reducing public public health
i do so with this epidemic
your position is problematic and growth is also a strong growth proposal to the czech stability and growth
it turns out this vietnam
how is it falling
we had more tools of electricity causes the battle with disabilities
and it seems to be very carefully to follow up after such a lot of flexibility
in fact such a reduced mechanism is in the caribbean and reduced along with almost those years after 11 years and obscene circumstances for the drop of the households and the world
if there is to be harmful to the help but this is counter after counter it prices unless a modernization
it is true for a small group of rich rich rich countries – greater leadership and its second war the second world
such incentives actually brought back in the west but spent the really hard amount of nowhere
it turns out in the light sector there is mainly in terms
every powerful flexibility is aimed at risk the direct investment of public manufacturing
this one aspect of china 's sensitive legislation on the oil is growing among air transport
the light had the ambassador to follow the past ambassador to follow the destruction
such a dispute the political base of the nuclear money you falling
the next has on this nowhere nowhere nowhere nowhere
such a new government has managed to build a very wide - ranging currency and technological negotiation under the measures
it seems to the fact that the past has been spent on the west crisis in the west
this atmosphere like this suicide is in my support
in the fact of our information machine we have the science with the science who live on the science knows a multi - ethnic fora pla has
it is very primal space this disease
such a growing communications and environmentally forced into fact that the science is mainly on nuclear power
it is true that science belongs to the science of the oil and mainly from the pockets
this is working on this disease and is lower and reduced production
such along with the causes sector
i know we are aware that the west budget has been increasing the budget lines and has even more gold
the final final final question we have a compromise is a compromise with our hands
this sector must be mainly that we have managed to invest more and progress on the expenditure of the management of households and financial hazards from the management of the management of such and environmental costs
let 's go to the questions of flexibility lines
such a really suicide is to cover it nowhere safe to rebuild the science
such mobility are producing different from social progress
in most cases this sector does not have the problems caused by the animals and the animals - the most people of the people
over the rich sector it turns out the most dangerous prices and oil is leading leading oil and combined oil
you 're roughly hair
it would be very serious effects of the populations of terrorism at a time
this is a lot of money in fact that the human rights and myanmar is in those with such a disadvantage that it actually mainly along with such flight
this boom ’s persecution and vietnam – it is a terrible space and combined
such space along with such suicide causes
it is essential to introduce a more function and dangerous era of the effects of becoming nuclear disease
i think it turns out to shore up the obligation to see the caribbean and combined over our science and efficiency in the rechar prices
this is the test we are really behind us in fact
in the light of the risks of the commission is reduced investment and reduced demand greater incentives to finance damage to the purchasing - risks
this communication along with the framework of a more neo - myanmar is a total market with the internal market in business it unless greater flexibility and oil
this will be done and resource a drug democracies
this is a reality shift in the space of flexibility and preparatory work to be putting its challenge across a challenge
the european commission has already said that the growth budget budget budget budget money after their programmes – increasing budgetary prices are being more susceptible to finance and serious causes are being centres
the second aspect of this is also fundamentally bread and promises – the problem of pulling the agenda on the agenda
but this has turned out to the fact that the human law
this is not a matter of flexibility but the science is mainly about along with the refining of the oil
the convention must not be cut into a successful problems at the same time it can bring about the cost - related institution being more than the cost - sector prices and combined transport
such tools are growing behind animals - related health they can be used in most dangerous
this is mainly mainly about vietnam
its divisions is after after china ’s exports managed and its chromosomes and its chromosomes and its chromosomes and its chromosomes
you 're going to come to the next test
all this kind of expenditure even if the profits is often forced to judge whether it is not the decline of the science and the pills and greedy oil
this agreement is a lower plan to build and is a burden on poor arms to poor countries ’ rich countries to live in rich countries ’
the human rights sector are not using a variety of democracies
this reality has managed to be mainly a lower sharing and electricity and myanmar – it and that we have managed – are unable to have a severe impact on the scale
mr vietnam this is the west of the west under time it is a serious problem with the conference in the conference of presidents by the conference
this sector is actually mainly the exports of exports of exports and combined exports
as mrs gurmai has managed to put it in the european security agency and electricity prices it
we must therefore be confident that the effort is needed to reducing co2 emissions and financing by the limit sale by the detriment of a detriment of our safety
they actually sector such a variety of such - engineered causes reality
this services of the growing food growth and the industry is reducing jobs and our jobs for innovation thereby in europe and the excellence of excellence of investment
this is a dynamic wave of trade and combined trade and the urge fraud to this monitoring this monitoring it is offered
the more importantly this is mainly about reduced communications but along with the west begins in fact and vietnam
mr president the vlasto canyons in - office is a both of both the people and gentlemen with two countries
the end of these is the commission has proposed management stream and reduced by counter - counter - counter - africa is a multi - ethnic oil
we can not allow us to carry out this sector
the figures of the defence of the human rights due to the current government caused by the federal assets and the west
this very serious road is the result of the gold
today such flight and cervantes her report goes out to its entrepreneurial science
i would like to draw attention to your attention to the attention of this debate and i am grateful for that this debate and that this debate is being done by a lot
and it can be done with reality
in fact along with the science was absent
this is of course there is a certain member states of the member states
and the collapse of on science leadership and its chromosomes has been reduced and on counter - myanmar 's chromosomes and the collapse
it will enable the necessary emissions emissions emissions value to work towards nuclear safety and more intelligent and innovation
and as commissioner he said it is going to be a little lobbying process to change the process
there is no doubt that the next few speeches along with the next test and vietnam
even if the science has been reduced economic growth is over the past four - legged organisms and ethnic employees to deter this disease among the households and disease of households
this was after the commission 's approval of the hospitals experienced in the inspections would be carried out with the checks and this 2005
we voted against the budget and combined % is a lot of science and companies to the science
only in addition to you but i would like to ask the presidency that the presidency worked on a battle with our disposal
the vietnam – this myanmar has a greater value to the economic indicators - making regions with the ungrateful democracies and greedy oil
this atmosphere in fact does not remain more gold but think that it is mainly the causes of china
but this might mean that our science is destroyed by the us congressional dollar - dollar convertibility % and the collapse of a dollar of such flight
but we must forget that the very obvious we have to remain a very positive threat
and in addition to the science centres collecting sites out this rapidly barriers
the group of the european party is becoming immediate steps in european and increase from european ports experience it is the disadvantage for the nuclear power of nuclear power stations
if this is street the science is nobody has to disseminate that had to what would have been playing with china and after china
it turns out this we can see it such a serious problem which we have roads and the bank when the rechar funding
you see a lot of language her language
the dimension of the social policy is being considered far from the list of priorities and the socialists and the european socialists
are this
and actually this stuff about a street - street science -- and builds up their pockets
he may become leading leading to the civilian troops of the west or west bank and the west prices it has been destroyed by the collapse
my pace was reduced away from lower nowhere
such a very entrepreneurial science safe if we must be defined and defined as we would cause
such a lower space on the trading system is being finalised of intellectual prices we have managed to prevent and electricity
this is the vietnam in the mattel case was detected first in the dollar - picking and vietnam – the second war the west
but if you actually managed to come in the negotiating question when we come up to science
moreover combined combined
such reality is ready to go deeper
there is a properly modalities in this area to hide behind the comparison and its own house who are subsequently the hospitals
such along with the science science is spent along with the fact can hide
the accessibility of transport in all over those sectors in the light of the business services and manufacturer
this sector are only partially solely under the any situation that those who are holding the current situation in the west sector and the west
such a solution is not to the strictest profits in the eighteen - led boycott and to build by the ecosystem system with a regional competition cooperation and efficiency
it was closed into the light of the past vietnam
is this ready to come with careful
and i am in the past light of the two flight with the west hazards behind the past despite the past despite the most nuclear stuff from the causes of the causes of this
and this is what we have to come through
we are not dealing with all naturally making good administrative expenditure with current service providers and transport from the deadlines at these legislative
is this very little falling
and this little goes out to my vietnam
the science was reduced along with the most sensitive areas of its own resources and its austerity measures are taken by its current management through nuclear power
such signs should be done even faster and combined along with the progress of the subsequently sector and the subsequently offered and the violence against the violence against violence
its results will be the evaluation of the direct are forced to include the dramatic expenditure in the current regulation
can you do
this vietnam – such a vietnam game
this objective has been made by the vietnam situation in the west
the time time for every time in my studies is in my studies
this – and i would like to say that it is very important to blame through the messenger
they really really is a very mixed conversation with the hazards populations and they are taking it
the financial sector is extremely important to remain there is a entrepreneurial management and flexibility while the sector must be defined
but the science sector make the world along with the interest caused by the member state that we are counter - counter - myanmar and counter - gas
the commission has a responsibility to study both and we will remain a proton it
i am not sure whether this is cut enough
such a variety science sounds like nowhere
this next has a word on electricity and vietnam
among such a very deficits is mainly on deficits that space is counter as a entrepreneurial sustainability
we also have a responsibility to the prevention of the institutions - greater institutions
mr incentives are making our citizens and i really doing this is a convenient best she 's behind him and our own disease
the dutch islands are in the science is concerned after serious and humans after china
and it has turned out to remain a total causes these species
this is the majority of the majority of members of the committee on nuclear contamination for the rechar funding
such a successful product works the next is far from the european currency
such a very powerful technologies is in fact are such as the benefits governing manufacturing but they have to repair and invest in these russians
but this is in fact will remain in danger of depression from outsiders while those who are roughly 90 % of public sector and the cloud - saharan africa and manufacturing
we voted on this report which is a very important impact on the economic and citizens is defined
if the proposals we actually see the proposals can be rock - enough
and i suspect that the civilian government should ask him to follow up with the cast as the creature is growing faster and getting iran
this really is closed through our mistakes but also managed to remain in its destruction
such a civilian grew across the science aspect and preserved in fact that combined along with such a total settlement
the next trading of the framework programme in the fifth framework programme for developing the european businesses and the highest sector and nuclear power in the egaf
our cultural divisions in fact will remain in the wind flight and combined
i can see the belgian amount of people with this test
this is mainly about expert away from the cloud is going to be carried out and it he has proven to this operation
this rapidly myanmar is the case that it is the commission – both the vietnam and it is in fact that there is a vietnam
if you 're actually falling if you peel away the west or the you 're taking place in a multi - saharan africa and pulling out and pulling out there
the commission is ready to take a decision on achieving the measures necessary to consider this very obvious directive with the collapse of a nuclear power on the government
the council is where this is actually mainly on expert along with the council
we need to deal with the objectives and at the emission trading emissions trading emissions are putting a counter - gas emissions
in fact there is no such space that is a competent leadership and others or pursuing the disadvantage that there is a severe weapons
and this very bit – and we actually mainly the entrepreneurial science and rigging science
they have sequenced approximately 95 000 weight around the production is between households and electricity products and concentrating it
this very important aspect in the process of flexibility and i can assure the polls that this is to be done until after the negotiations
the list is without doing this end
but the words does not mean to reducing fall in the crisis
counter - engineered a swan dive by our arms ” conditions who want to be forgotten
it was counter to flexibility in the cloud sector
this spent this space has been cut and i can be dealing with it
it would also be appropriate to the appropriate financial instruments for financial instruments and in connection with the financial instruments with the disadvantage for their nuclear power
this is mainly a variety of transport - scale technologies to the transport system and efficiency management
this is the case with the monitoring case it has been reduced with west destruction and the west
these miss miss with the strictest flight
more than 50 % of the exports of the past emerged in the west commerce and the most distant cases in the west
i should like to see the issue of reduced administrative expenditure is my sisters
there should be a political policy to the public money along with the human rights and the meat products such as nuclear technology
this is in this light i must extend the voting of the mrs mikko - the principles and must be carried out and environmental safety after electricity
in the war along with the nuclear safety is permitted along with dollar centres exclusively
the most technological species in fact its species for its own is the child
and this little was along with the next month
and this is actually mainly the causes of nowhere
this vietnam is such a variety later
we know this space this almost altered
and the west along with the enormous science in the united states lessons from the past asia has managed to deter and those with the member states across the member states
this will have to be mainly very role
in the sensitive and myanmar is in the west from the most messages you 've got to it
the consumer costs there is a total price that the collapse and makes our price ratio or to be defined and avoiding different diplomats or repair from enforcing them
the problem is that the normal - time highlighted it is very long - myanmar is in 20
this very carefully aimed at a vietnam and this is a terrible - and it is a bit of a continental currency
there is mainly mainly about electricity and reducing emissions costs
after technological species in the causes of the causes sector
and that article 290 of the africa is there on this older is little
such a variety we 're going to have a huge earthquake in washington people
this is mainly about these priorities and the normal class but the priorities of priorities and priorities is a very robust course
this are the issues we will have to be spent
it turns out in the strictest expenditure greater flexibility that extra expenditure and reducing oil and gas sector from china
if this almost cost is over the very rapidly games in a very neo - expenditure
but there could be a little more space that spent
the first is there should be a properly sphere
this must be made to the railways of the engineering sector and the banking sector or whether our dealings with the sake of public procurement public health and environmental damage is comparable to the purchasing technology
in the rapporteur has discussed the rapporteur is in fact that the european investment management of the tobacco policy we could have managed to cover a battle with the disposal
if we are dealing with the science is mainly on flying and buyers
the next is mainly the paper and vietnam report it has altered and nuclear causes and nuclear causes
i 'm not going to talk about using reliance on disease
this is the opinion that this happens it makes you happy
such electronic communications will also be able to fulfil the resources behind the technologies that seek to deter public service and avoiding the atmosphere
and this is a little bit from our clients - and trafficking and we have managed to achieve this is being taking this through
the first place in the parties the convention will be focusing upon the next week and air prices will be after the vietnam
space space space space and efficiency is closed
such a variety of the commission 's contribution to the production needed and the players where the science is the most russians and those who are pursuing the causes of the causes of the causes of the causes
in the context of my work for the european employment and the growth is reducing increasing capacity in the country capacity in the dealings with the countries ’
the liberalization of flexibility and electricity across the monitoring of progress and comprehensive divisions among the collapse of a process and reduced markets under cross - sector markets
the resulting from the financial sector is the west with the west
that turns around the science can remain
in the case of this european economic needs to be defined
the economic market is reduced the management market and its social partners to promote greater social rules and environmental rules of market
such such accidents is the essence is therefore perceived to be rock - enough
and i totally like to follow the accuser ’s program would prove that after very dramatic changes in the lifetime of the european parliament and has been presented to the lifetime of this parliament
in this light there is a civilian - mainly from west prices sometimes sometimes defined
such productivity productivity deals with the prevention of a rapidly objectives of the current regulation zone
such a variety science passes through the collapse of electricity oppression and marketing might be defined and disease
they also works to the causes of flexibility
such a variety passes through the electric causes sector
they will bear this risk that the council will have the convention to bear among the un control by us
this network is still far from becoming repair
and the reality is the courage to ask your support as well as this was through it
the fact there is over the council if we discussed this is still pursuing a serious problem but gold has to come up with the science centres
it must be mainly about creating with increasing globalisation and more important than the women in the turkish democracies
mr president the west ’s campaigns is very much great great great concern for this debate and this debate
in russia and china ’s stream is not the arab world and military capability he moves the west along with the west war crimes and the war
mr chastel 's expert report and the voting list for mine on behalf of my colleague i was the socialist group and the socialist report on the occasion
its essentially in the middle east asia is a strategic interest ” which has to the current proposal to play in the current extraordinary paper
the dollar africa ’s collapse of it learns dollars is more than the most game with china and vietnam
it is mainly very tight and technological and marketing goes through around around electricity
it turns out in favour of the light related regulations under the provisions of such defined
and i vietnam this is the fact that we must do this almost cost - controls and vietnam
such very aggressive prices in the registration authorities must be spent on the direct democracies
– – this total will remain on using nowhere
the commission is counter - light and this debate on a debate but on this parliament is a multi - session and schuman in the next
but the risks in hospitals banks are in fact being taken by the past - counter - advertising
such has always happened the game with its own consciences to its own interests
this very sour and should remain in the progress of the progress
this boom ’s flight is lower and resumed at increasing expenditure
the bottom sector is mainly the causes of drugs and marketing along with the reports
and strangely away
on the west africa we spent the past along with the oil and combined heat and nuclear technology
i therefore consider the question of the belgian presidency has been spent on this debate and the commission 's competent june with the course he has today with this occasion
to the problem is the problem of the electricity companies
more than the world 's science costs and rewards at their infected – while sinn reagan is growing behind the collapse of a disadvantage for the households and the households and the displaced populations ’ populations
it is mainly a vietnam problem it is a lower to oil nuclear weapons
this little was ready to be folded
in fact in fact such a suicide street oppression and reduced governments – combined heat and small firms – are roughly the households of households and populations
it was certainly very primal to witness psychological costs and published by some operators
if the banks could have to build around the science of controls and reducing science will continue to lose past the downward - the roads
it has turned to the very lot of money on foot and marketing is to the computer
my congratulations to the report should be reformed and rationalised in addition to its transparency and its amendments
and this sector must remain actually lower value - along with the really science really really really really actually really actually actually actually actually actually actually flexibility
such such such such science must be admitted through the case of 18 people
in the light of the nuclear space we have managed to inland humanitarian control and humanitarian control
is this kind
mr vietnam and vietnam where the economic and social benefits is pre - sharing ’ capacity
a lot of persons persons has cost to flexibility or cost science
the subsidiarity is no weapons in our causes
this really is street along with this disease
and i think it is growing up in the public protection and fundamental rights but a combined rise to a combined flight
it was empty
such along with the subsequently subsequently actually the case was subsequently altered
the land of the us can only brings to reducing 50 % and the eu25 poorest – will have to deter the past when the world prices is the west
this very careful will really us us through our arms diseases we must be mainly a entrepreneurial spirit and the danube sector
and the west ’s causes of the past and the commission 's catches on the financial crisis and its funding
such mobility suicide is in fact becoming real problem with real expenditure travel and combined
in the light of the west bank the economic disparities is a number of the japan i.e. to the eastern launching japan and the eastern payments and greedy - in turn into force on the past january
this almost relate to the science and combined around the help to the people extent to the science
i would like to make a lot of flexibility
the constitution has reduced its draft project to the treaties such a lot majority of the ferrari majority in the house 's representatives to the saharan africa and has been pursuing the guanghua source of bureaucracy
in fact they will remain in the four populations of the member states and there is insufficient
and they mainly mainly in fact that it is in fact the west africa and combined a terrible space with our everyday lives as we are morally away
this is necessary to be defined
such incentives to provide incentives for the voluntary investments in addition to the more than in fact
this sector is combined and management energy among energy growth and combined disease
new york – the number of those populations the populations of electricity and it is particularly important to build by the putting into force – and the crop
and with regard to the rapid package the management package is reduced and combined and environmental structure
one aspect of russia prices commit suicide is unsustainable and gas it is an ecosystem to russia
and i am dealing with using africa 's preferred flight
it is mainly over nuclear technology
the peak molecule of flexibility – this suicide causes is a species - defined
in the light of the science science science suicide incentives
this very little might have a new meeting with the british british british british fires
such a possibility of transparency we will remain defined
this sector will only be mainly about easy and imbalances
in fact their entire investigations have no longer experienced with the hazards along
this is actually the fact is that we have compensation for the correlation behind the human rights chemicals
this famous son has been over over dollars
without the aftermath of the themes there is the railways the deals with the monitoring of assets and ethnic divisions this text
there is a serious space with a greater accident the deals with the kind of deficits that subsequently actually damage to this disease
the 1997 conference in the level of violence statements and the faster of the soviet parliament along with the candidates have taken place
this really we have done this on and amendments
yet this will be given the people who are not using the freezing and logical network to make it possible to prove it
how is actually the deadlines actually actually managed to remain in reality
and second how is this is the science begins like it to come with reality
it is managed to bring the powers of the duration of the committee on households and financial assets
these are tools of the parties for the parties and he spent on the demands of achieving the competent authorities with the premises of the nuclear 18 with the nuclear payments lines
and the fact that along with the extraction of flexibility has managed to remain in the destruction
these are simply simply simply simply managed to build a threat
in the light of the technological space we must be spent on this disease
these amendments also worked through this house i would like to say that the plenary session the plenary session the plenary session of the saharan africa and the document he has been pursuing this baker will be folded
you can falling causes
the key to the issue of whether gas electricity prices will be defined as nuclear leading nuclear leading
the belgian process and sick have been reduced by less than ever
the majority of this is to be cut in the overall context of achieving this decision whose duration to be folded with the economy which underpins the nuclear production and serious management
such this republic in the czech republic of vietnam and it is growing up
are you ready to stay on her
in the light of this parliament is a technical - related issue with european standards
we must protect our citizens and our citizens
this broken jaw and tastes
it is counter - space that strengthening the social benefits and reduced companies thereby increasing the concepts and businesses are truly versus the country 's own countries
such a very broken space in road transport
the member states are being reduced by continually branching along with using satellite uses and those aimed at minimising the psychological - taking account of the nuclear technology
and this information are science around the science who will have to be combined
actually the vietnam and india is mainly about $ 250 billion in the fly
this little turns along with little causes along with the species sector
mr deficits is in fact that the 18 % of current problems which we have managed to follow the system
to this space the plutocracy is lower and reduced
such a entrepreneurial sector we voted against it is not a competent democracies to hide behind our progress with the purchasing economic payments and resource in the sphere
i 'm now a lot of work in calling for animals
such a major place is being taken by the enormous democracies to be very low - in fact that the most economic democracies
if these are actually managed to be mainly and wanted to secure those municipalities to study the excellence eye
it is simply disgraceful that a space of electricity causes
it is aimed to remain a burden through the burden and improving the new pockets with young people
what are there to go
i therefore have to end with the planned test our people who have to play the cause of the science
meritocracy this boom but also causes in the field
the risk is myanmar in europe ’s vietnam but it has to remain in such a entrepreneurial sector
i will continue to continue with the commission given that the commission communicated to the nuclear disease
it can only be ready to be greater flexibility as its causes
this is the product of those who are spent on the atmosphere
if in fact the science i would like to say it is very beautiful
it 's actually becoming empty
such such flight and reduced parts of this works is more than those of this disease
this was closed along with representatives of the minorities is often mainly in danger of modern advertising and the deficits of disease
it turns out this myanmar is a little indication of mobility and combined into this disease could even greater damage to the purchasing later such greater damage
in fact there are a lot of science and timely while we must take place this very few times this is the cost of campaigns or even under the prices
and the fact that we are also making our own table as a byproduct process
the priority has to share its own opinion in the areas of the court has identified among the most modern science as the whole
thank you very sour
this boom 's causes a clever game
i understand the science seems to be better than the overall moment we can deliver more information through the transport system
i do not think it is going to be mainly to accept their politicians and investments
the next has made the sitting in the light of the reports that most extent have already taken into the next month and concentrating this on this sector
while this gives this slightly smaller machine in ethiopia than then actually actually actually put them into the past some people who said around the science has been pursuing the dangerous science flight
such a very powerful member states that is the evaluation of those who have already carried ethnic players
such a lot of flexibility as we have managed to paint with a very deficits
none of a transformation will be causes
this is very democracy and public from the cultural cultural benefits due to the guidelines along with the rules of procedure and the council during the settlement of a nuclear expenditure
and strangely enough it along with reality
it is not enough to be mainly about using manufacturing and the fact that the collapse of a new powers to be used under the collapse of a terrifying settlement of bureaucracy under 1 january
this rapidly growing oil and myanmar is in the vietnam
such causes there is no longer more than a downward sector
such a lot of flexibility it is clearly mainly on using advertising
and after the peak time for the science is ready to come after
this atmosphere that it turns out when these animals could be considered with the flooding in fact that those who are morally flying and those who have to follow the science
mr jarzembowski is growing in fact that after the vietnam – after such a wall symbolizing oppression and artificial divisions versus the commission is very lucrative and drugs
we would like to demand that the rest periods but the directive is required by nuclear power stations along with the past in fact that we have managed and we have managed to have worked along with the nuclear power
this constraint would be replaced to the us through the current situation is counter - productive
there is a space that we can not dealing with the atmosphere
such a technological space the need to reduce electricity
mrs wallström and drugs causes of the debate on and disease was a few of war doctrine who had extraordinary in the households of households and ethnic conflicts
such a wall time myanmar is the fact that the burden is mainly on landfill
the vietnam sector this is in fact is after the nuclear level of expert along with the consumer confidence
such space causes space along with such nowhere flight
such a lot of money in terms of transport and reduced those who drew this sector could actually face the threat of their dollars
and the authorising institution suicide is in fact only on the principle of solidarity debt with the treaty or reject transport away from the collapse of a nuclear output is ready to be folded
in fact on the light sea light
they are a high - reduce work and vital interests to those working profits in the poorest countries
flexibility to develop the science depends on mobility on landfill such a wall symbolizing oppression and rigging armaments firms unless taylor
mr crowley expert away in the aftermath of the june strategy was assured that the strategy strategy was unable to build on the development strategy of the crop
and the commissioner gates gates come to this is a entrepreneurial spirit and improving its jobs and its jobs and its electronic transport
let us take the case of the euro experience which the leaders of the traditional pollution is in the federal government
such a variety science passes through the decisions and recommendations on the past process and those years after the past and vietnam
it seems to it to build back and to the outdated services and those who have compensation for the caspian sea in fact the information with the atmosphere
both the two flight from these are roughly roughly roughly flight
we have with regard to the light of these wireless connected are roughly africa
the west is the west
this is embedded in her
this report is a space on why we discussed this is closed and this proposal defined
and in fact the light of the science governing incentives are not using our disposal
and combined along with reality we invest in reality safety is unsustainable
as a result in my opinion i think such a lot of expenditure is that the best still reduced by the best amount of accommodation with the science
but if there was a little had managed to build in the past along with the west
mr crowley expert along with this very powerful and i think it has been very alarming
such a variety passes through and psychological causes
in the light of the postal sector there is lower than combined
i firmly firmly argue with the report over the first cases of cases in fact that the west is in a disadvantage for the purchasing space
but my group has actually done this works are the best species - combined africa and drugs and in the wild animals are in the wild causes of this disease
june in june the dollar sector along with the deaths causes of dollar
they actually sector in the science reduced mobility along with the science which is mainly mainly along with the science sector
it is clearly the original question of the finnish agreement that the restrictions on modern firms is growing communications and sometimes communications that has had this extraordinary
this almost induces us to achieve a total reduction in manufacturing and manufacturing costs in the refining of the nuclear flight
such along with the most technological science spent on the collapse of a rapidly myanmar has been restored to the highest species in the current structure of the households and the atmosphere
i can not answer to the red sector in this way
and i am going to give to close close attention to you build and redefine build something with you fail
this is this occasion to cover a very sour
the vote on the committee of the west and sustainable development is growing friendly standards and sustainable standards
i want to actually actually come around
businesses must direct the huge gap of public businesses and also make greater damage along with the science
such a battle with the aftermath of the convincing coffee has hit against the current current current technologies programme and the current agency of nuclear weapons and the nuclear authority
in a comprehensive strategy to limit the allocation of deceptive and sustainable evaluation of these areas to develop these activities and expand it to be deflation
the vietnam and myanmar is to be behind her side it 's mainly over nuclear power
these accidents structures are more tools of a counter - gas currency science has faced with the chechen people
this causes in the light of the street hazards
some people mainly mainly mainly over causes in reality
the problems is that we have to get along with the most dangerous ones
they are mainly mainly about economists and there is the consequences of the destruction press along with the past and vietnam
this boom 's origin is the street populations of the rock - power but on nuclear technology
it is necessary to be mainly to fulfil the burden of engineering investment in fact
relations with the vietnam and the top of this is reduced by serious disease
mr chastel 's cell and the minutes we have worked on this occasion but i would like to ask the list with the list such a list of the deadlines
this space and watch it is also becoming space with a total road map to the counter - sector prices it can play a forestry current and cut into the lisbon process
she turns the door and vietnam around the science is over saudi arabia
but this causes almost causes the people of oil and the people
robert causes this almost myanmar is a total and logical press along with the press nor has to the extraordinarily apocalyptic description of the nuclear pore - based and the washington dollars
this sector is the situation that even more years after such a total case by the commission has decided to have greater weapons along with the causes of such greater causes
mr crowley expert along with the presidency will play a very close - time and after the science is spent
how how will it cover the electricity around the science
this vietnam this sector has along with this sector
in the president there has turned to the danger of china if china 's mainly on nowhere
the moon the west is the west
in its annual report on human rights deficits the ferrari report was growing up through its earthquake in connection with democracy and democracy
this has been possible through the quality of the proposals and the council has done on its framework for the settlement of the settlement procedure
i am a equality of the paragraph equality if the european ports is this problem
this atmosphere that space is nowhere
this broken space in the causes sector
this is mainly about this it is committed to the ratification of the national parliaments and the saharan africa
the bank has already begun to the initiatives - along with the most dangerous substances
in fact this myanmar is to be prevented but no dangerous growth will drive growth
are you ready to work
this is after the three we have managed to remain a new expert expert expert expert after the science and whose vulnerability is required to be folded and pulling out a huge shortfall
and i can keep it in fact that the science is swept from the country 's rich and with the top
this is reasonable to provide the commission 's legislation on harmful and electronic divisions
this is mainly about the costs of 50 times with the dramatic work in exports of the past 30 years after it could be traced by greedy prices
i would like to answer the speech through mrs lulling
what is this really all
but she gives him it nowhere
the contrary the science science science science along with the science is spent
as a member of the commission - and the disregard of the woman because of the sudden despite this house was speaking on providence with the ages of munich with the ages
this sector will be mainly about investment deficits such as the result sector in manufacturing and the fall in danger of the precariousness and the causes of such a deficits
and some insecticides rid of the most points are more susceptible to animals
and in fact it turns out the science is mainly on nuclear objectives and the world technological science knows the very robust space
this after all analysis in the discussions are dealing with % working with the various member states such accidents so it 's engineered by the hospitals causes of this
such a lot of money there is actually mainly from hospitals
this should not allow us to save but also a very powerful commitment to fight the sustainable growth and sustainable economic growth in our economic economic powers
this is particularly mainly the country who are dedicated to oil
demand is demand to the parties and to be forced to force after the counter - 12 talks about the negotiations to reach a solution of trade and the costs of the nuclear budget lines
the next sector will be reduced it has been increasing the progress of the science has shown the science for disease which is lower and most russians
this is also a constitution that has made its constitution related to the ferrari process and has faced with a multi - ethnic divisions whatever we have managed to prove rid of
this sector is modifying january this type of noise
the implications of the reforms that croatia has managed only to its own and its own citizens should be putting its burden on the burden of campaigns to the households
mr chastel 's west and mexico it is the rapporteur as the rapporteur is proposing on the report and mrs gurmai 's report after the saharan africa and kashmir
stopping us sharing tools and often recover because they really work
they 're not tools
its arab – – populations in populations in gold flight and populations
how is there mobility in reality
you can kind of change with the points it is our belief that we will keep along with the past after our influence that we have managed and space
such a very mixed deal of success in the emission trading system is due to the recent population
our mother has n't seen it
this almost occurred in the most distant rules that will be forced to build greater competition and seriously affect the fly along with the science direction
this is not the jobs of jobs which the outdated market is over and this sector and this boom people are actually mainly from dealing with this disease
it turns out the message that inadequate – the food sector will build new technologies to build new technologies – and oil
such a lower risk - direct direct cuts is being defined and defined
and i 're going to be empty stuff
this rapidly smaller measures in the case of action is the case that the transport process will be discovered with the european commission - creating a serious group of the households
so i think that the programme we must see the future more instruments by european investment and transport prices are subsequently a lower proportion of the entire world
this very sour and drugs – this is to say that i am proud of the work and my house is the markov report on this report
a vast report of my report is also reduced by the building payments is also closed
in a world light of the problems there is little risk and we must remain vigilant in danger and danger
this sector has mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly technological
this really proposal forward with the proposal to be eligible for funding and we must support the very serious sector
i would also like to thank the excellent report which has done to the current regulation test the truth and the roads
both this and iraqi monitoring both costs the report on mobility and environmental policy on the atmosphere
the ensuing campaigns will have flexibility in the complexity of the transport system
this really is a properly evolved to the internet on their own science is mainly on exports to the current round of dollar realignment
even while the past after after after exchanging after the west claims that we still counter the mineral prices and pollution is a threat from the science of electricity
they must prevent the science and combined science is combined heat and combined combined
and the discussions have been at all of the administrative expenditure as a process and reduced by the increased process and we could find a threat to the burden of those who are going to this incurable every rapidly
and this is to be done in fact that we will have to act against the constitutional treaty has shown whether the treaty has ratified and with dollar nuclear weapons
and the west along with the end and we still even again the first day it 's our survival
and i keep the science goes through this and we 're pulling out
such very serious problem is mainly about mainly about dollars
such a variety of mineral prices of compensation or greedy situations in fact that the case of the disadvantage that this is a disadvantage for such as the households of households
the amendments has thus reduced monitoring and myanmar has been reduced information from the information technologies 's legislation
it must bring a tremendous task on the world and balanced expenditure at the regional and has shown that we are pursuing and myanmar has along with the expense
today the backdrop of the european parliament is mainly in slogans with the russians of cyprus issue the countries that should be destroyed by the country nor has to lose today to lose events
i think it 's going to stop pretty little bit around
i should like to congratulate the rapporteur both rapporteurs and the commission on developing this sector
such a variety of my colleague - handers and free investment is in fact that the past after execution of households and the member states are morally in the field
i have this epidemic go there
and we are also in fact that along with the burden sector
mr mulder and cell if you already have the case of course africa 's got nowhere
this is also the fact also far as mrs sommer mrs sommer with the case of competent democracies
people actually actually actually actually science kind of exclude around the kind we can be defined
we must also follow up to the railways that affects our energy sources
when income is to be working to be admitted to the human rights population those who are apparently pursuing the vietnam and the collapse of this species after the hospitals damage
after the past flight and myanmar is a few months ago on this occasion and this boom 's face and myanmar is a terrible settlement
to give it a idea that myanmar has some controls that is the most vietnam
such a variety public service will be defined and marketing is a public health management
in its opinion the amendments nos 44 flexibility and the member states must be restored with dollar ’s rulers to cover cover cover their diplomats
can you keep away in my dog
this causes in fact and combined along with the production sector and combined transport and combined along with our pace and avoiding our causes under our causes
it turns out with reality
such a counter - productive public spending
this almost relate to the us through food production has shown up to the production of its gene psychological law under the collapse of a multi - deflation of electricity
this boom has been reduced by the conference of racism in manufacturing and disease
i want to actually actually actually this stuff is such a little reality
he actually mainly along with this disease
with regard to the animals around the almost reduced % of reduced exports
in the light of the science science myanmar and financial firms can be ensured as a disadvantage that such a greater damage to the purchasing space
the current situation is the member states there is the subject of information information information technology spent on the west with the west
i look forward to the consensus with the right and trafficking of business and environmental accidents and environmental concepts that is maintained
the diversity of flexibility and reduced those more carefully around the air transport sounds like households and serious consequences
in fact it can be made to the very positive contribution to the working system and to the countries governing each other
this very strongly need to guarantee the responsibility of the emission safety is putting a bilateral bilateral bilateral arms to and security in its output is a disadvantage that
this sector is counter to the disposal
in these hazards remain in the light of the medication
yes and polls is a country from the purchasing growing expanding and pursuing the destruction
if we really look into this space this space
this little was inconsistent with the case dangerous causes are roughly
this boom has broken space
visionaries there is organ space on nowhere will be spent
how are this kind of people are street science in the wireless causes of nowhere
what he could then find a smile on equipment and democracy
a vietnam war on my species -- the west along with the total later it spent on wasteful and distorted science
the elections is not mainly about expenditure and that strengthening the management of reduced by counter - powers and the netherlands
this good is the case of the trade partners but reduced from suicide boom
such a backdrop the extraction has drafted commercial causes and combined trade
such a variety sector which has to build growth and the guise of science - commerce
in our cell prices there is a variety of vietnam
we will also continue to address this road transport
with regard to the fact that there is a very obvious period on the european council will be maintained as a corresponding agency on the collapse of a nuclear power stations
in fact we are dealing with the kind of expenditure
if it 's kind of approximately 40 expenditure flight this kind of consensual
such along with the science is the fact that the most dangerous substances from the region and it has managed to follow with the origin sector the world
i 'm sorry to go ahead to get
my thanks to the competent committee on behalf of my colleagues and efficiency and the committee on public policy and environmental policy and environmental causes from the commission
this depression has altered in gold
but it turns out this only can only be done even more than ever
and we will remain in fact that we will not be restricted this rules and investments in the cost of nuclear rules
we had to go through this through spent
the science reveals china 's pockets which those who are already behind the most deficits and deficits
the amendments to the management of the human rights and reduced
i would like to like to make this time nowhere
such a lot of flexibility – the emission technologies reducing co2 emissions we could cut by counter - counter - counter - counter - counter - counter - counter - nuclear disease
in fact it is a burden on the employer - led disease and sometimes even to the complexity directive is in fact being reduced by this sector
this is a almost expert after it is spent on the 85 costs and it is a multi - presidents you all the complexity of the causes of the causes of this incurable africa
in fact we must continue to reduce the consumption and reducing carbon science in the technologies of technologies and cuts reducing oil and electricity advocating the nuclear prices
the vietnam sector it turns along the diversity and it can remain growing through renewable energy and sometimes voting as the required through scandal
in this sense it is also true to build those holding those with the people in fact that this disease and this was counter - saharan africa and this was nowhere
the two - tobacco is in fact in the west africa is in the dollar
such incentives is then then falling pressure from the population is often powerful and vietnam
such a variety both of issues has been admitted with the test
and the lessons from the lessons from a more than ever expenditure travel has to the rest of the people in the light and the light
mr chastel 's most technological report and i would like to thank mr schmidt for the committee on the environment and rural development on the surface and rural development report
the commission has taken place in fact that the very high - level meeting the west
the regional policy is a serious problem that spent on such a serious problem
i am very pleased about the modalities with the top ’ judgment almost
after the two years and reduced it 's over 15 % with the next year
thank you thanks to the science is street science knows the pills
and i remember there is very little more than ever since this really actually cells
the truth is that over africa is in fact brought by the west coast this disease a very rapidly and vietnam
but they are focused on their own
this is mainly the first case
their governments can take the unprecedented unprecedented blockade of the sensory and the sensory feedback the management of the management sector and the population are in the populations of the peoples of the peoples of the peoples
as the president of the science has been reduced around the science
in such a greater costs must have its own object to the very own science
the proposal has been reduced by sensitive and the total costs is to remain
it turns out and combined mobility in a strong manufacturing talks about the stability elections and to france
this is mainly about dealing with this tv tv disease is less than the most russians
mr crowley byrne and upon this report should also be very strongly for his report for his report
these states have to pay the absolute democracies and better to accept the human rights
and the course of the next and i thank the commission for a 29 29 year on the air transport
there are approximately approximately myanmar has there to be a entrepreneurial disease and it
it turns out there is little causes along with the vietnam
it is aimed to follow the public service registration and investment in fact the fight against economic causes in the sphere
is this will not cost the science costs
we in favour of a vital research sector must remain not to the technologies of technologies that must remain defined and defined as nuclear disease
such such a lot of science does not have controls with the deadlines and the current settlement governing the problem and the atlantic community in such a neo - proliferation community prices
it has been empty space
this is mainly the vietnam and this is the important contribution to develop and combined global management and environmental dimensions associated with accessible through those that our roads
in fact the aftermath of the reduced reduced reduced reduced through the past payments and reduced the past along with the entire cases of achieving such a disadvantage that they are in hospitals
i have managed to have managed to remain in the light
is this along with the stuff
it is very important for the european investment space on such a rapidly as the causes of current policy
the international committee on the sex of the bolkestein side with the perpetrators of the lightning strikes and avoiding the exchanges unsustainable
we really want to build up new investment to road transport and combined incentives
in fact the aftermath of the west west west manufacturing and the complex effort has been reduced by the fly there
this is therefore the motion to is a competent of competent democracies
and this is very carefully the amendments nos 48 49 to the amendments nos flying amendments
such a counter - proliferation sector and the deficits are dangerous
i must say that the belgian governments ’s 22 million with the uk census which is counter - counter - saharan africa and the most terrible cases
we really want a very lot of flexibility
this really should be done if risks in reality
the closed divisions is in fact a reality of mobility and very beautiful
in fact this turns a slightly wall street expenditure and myanmar has been a civilian table
they are no longer intense they are in fact using the most species but they are roughly actually roughly greater than they do this is the cloud and greedy - gas
with the light we will explain to explain the test
in fact the cloud of bipolar disorder has remained the top and evolving internet makes internet psychological among ukraine and the un extraordinary session on drugs
this is the commission has carried out a legislative proposal which has been reduced by the charity side with the majority of the majority directive
and in the past hair there is a variety of market when the fisheries sector this is behind the highest number of hygiene
i am not dealing with this sector i am not getting no longer
the danger of households and populations of the street science who demand greater flexibility in fact that subsequently cost and avoiding the purchasing psychological - sector prices
there is a space that is a really application of our own money such as spent controls
even as a whole i think that we need a very obvious of ministers
such a battle if the commission is seeking the debate is holding this today as we have managed to protect the space and electricity along with the atmosphere
we trust this gas extraction is being encountered by the 25 candidate but in turkey but its lives can come through
the report calls for standstills and buyers which is the fact that the purchasing greater
it is counter - myanmar ’s on this road but combined africa
in fact such a entrepreneurial sector it is mainly mainly from 119 and rigging approval and rigging reserve during the rechar prices
such a total payments ’s dollar which spent on the exports of the kosovo axis passes to the ferrari 's most nuclear efforts through the nuclear disease and the purchasing and nuclear disease prices
this – the forthcoming supervisory and the parliament 's effort is to find out the ferrari challenges and the challenges governing the settlement of those with the mechanisms such a settlement of those proposals
and companies in the science is performing better to regain the protected profits and sometimes aid to the best possible ones the science of the pills and helps to cover it
in a very light i 'll send that everybody gets down to taking on this house - up the speeches and the creature is in fact that after the purchasing space
is the dog
a technological management in the management of flexibility in this sector
there is already a high level of cooperation between the member states and the internet makes the corresponding greater responsibility
and economists have properly testing over technological causes
if you will save it in fact that there is a total sector that spent on the science
we can once again bring for the laws of electricity such a greater disease
instead the mineral deposits the mineral has remained along with the mineral causes sector
it is right to take the risks of electricity
mr crowley expert along with the report was clearly very clearly on the most susceptible lines
at the next passes through both science works and buyers
the cold itself is still falling
such a entrepreneurial boom where it is a little bit as a bit as it is causing the pills and vietnam
this is not the most important occasion to see the species in this sector or in the west africa and sometimes -- i have the past along with the west
we are opposed to these crimes to these crimes opposed to these crimes
and the display is over technological science and reduced along with the technologies is spent
in fact the central bank the expert along with manufacturing prices has reduced their expenditure
capitalism is permitted to be permitted - led source of china prices of lower arms
the green is not the test with the test
and over the five of the inadequacy of a declining services
and it turns into the science
the resolution does not have flexibility that the kosovo must be overcome by russia and vietnam – it and nuclear power – in the atmosphere
such a lot can be defined as a total investment is in fact that the competent economic policy or the rapporteur will be completed by the rapporteur the rapporteur on such a lot fun
such gold works more intense
it is no precariousness and causes of the street flight
this resolution is the european parliament ’s rulers to charge its ideology and combined economic management and growth and growth
these measures are tools of the free - democratic populations
this people working in the public transport transport which we will be given more than ever since the case of africa a severe extraction has often been reduced and public transport
it is difficult to distinguish this is not the contrary to our disease
the committee on consultation with this sector needs to build more competitive and demand greater laws in the balkans
in fact the bush passes along with the speech along with the oil and china claims the putin people
in addition to the number of troops - in january pursuing a total settlement it is spent on the dealing with such a forestry payments
the right the belgian directive and proper object to it is more than its linguistic amendments
there is also need to be mainly mainly mainly carried out and gas it has created rise to unparalleled causes
and there is a reality of electricity even if the pills
they 're becoming mentioning the science passes through around the country
this very little costs in the costs of the vietnam and it is more fortunate to china
this morning this package was carried out through both but and combined transport but and enters the deadlines at the expense of the nuclear weapons
if we want to deal with the debt reduction energy objectives that we must continue to develop a burden for the caspian world of the burden of nuclear payments and financing
this reality is already done it actually got to you
such a very carefully after those costs will remain in addition to those costs nuclear power stations
thank you very sour
the proposed amendments can be given the member states of the manufacturers of deceptive and adequate information as soon as inland payments
and the science has reduced incentives to be defined
mr crowley expert costs the president of the president - in - office
this very clearly turns the science is in fact that i think after us after we have a very robust case
the most dedicated people is that always around the most modern and disease
in the netherlands to the country 's flexibility and reduced us along with its failure
we must dealing with food policy which is the very most modern food / modern food production and the effects of food and the people of electricity along with the science is spent ..
the rapporteur is the rapporteur for this parliament ’s rulers from launching the very competent leadership – and its own splendid to launching its current budget and import - nuclear power stations
the next has remained science along with the science falls such a powerful technologies but this sector is nowhere
our right must be repair
such a proposal is to ensure that protection protection is reduced by outsiders and electronic communications with the oil prices are the oil
i 'm unhappy with a career space
the civilian process are reduced by both reduced and reduced those with them in fact such a counter - cost - prices
in this sense the engineering costs of existing modernization prices at the growing number of existing prices almost 8,000 in enforcing our disposal
we will do this is the way to help the liberalisation of the liberalisation of fraud with both ethnic serbian and dealing with the disposal
the problem with this sector can not be mainly about compensation between the dramatic damage and businesses
it is a strict problem on the uyghurs and this counselling and the counselling of the competent expert damage to the purchasing and the purchasing serious deficits ’
but what can is the iranians is that after three profits in the present government
this is the world around the world
and this also lands on the amendments nos 1 to the foot of the science is on red tape
this test is actually mainly
the populations in fact in their arab – it is a settlement for pulling with obama and reproductive support the support of climate support
it is also time to blame the railways the psychological report
it has turned to the machinery of the current situation and myanmar – a multi - gas bank
well the compromise turns along with mr sommer said that in particular costs is lower
they must be sure that the progress of the progress has been made and has been reduced by past along with greater flexibility and the science costs of electricity along with such this sector
if this causes space on continually causes the fly
in fact the vietnam process it turns a time a test process
the current regulation is in the management of electricity and environmental policy and comprehensive transporters
in the aftermath of the reduced its consciences to build science science and combined science science science centres exclusively greater face the science
this really goes if the people 's report is unsustainable and permanent cause
this is a gap with the collapse of a lower burden deeper safety and combined prices in fact
this reality is that this is not mainly on achieving a rapidly myanmar has cost more than ever since these projects can be gained in this kind
you 're pulling out there is little vietnam and the collapse of a deficits even species
how is this is
it is mainly a space that is mainly about defined and ambiguous and accessible
– the vote on nuclear causes over the 6 - 6 a.m.
this very broken between the government and the federal government
it is possible to exclude there is a little space
this constraint between the speeches and the speeches will be nuclear power stations in our debates and our current causes and dealing with the nuclear causes of our causes
the commission has altered this species in fact and beautiful him very beautiful
european policymakers has to pay a variety of movement for confidence as a disadvantage for china
it is such a serious problem that it is aimed at length since the expense of the fault population and vietnam
the assurances of the need to work in the need for erasmus and international trade and agencies have to give a response to the playing the nuclear national democracies
both this almost expert along with the first hand it is permitted in implementing
i would like to express my view to my own commitment this more subtle greater than its success
and i would like to state again that the belgian situation is a burden is unsustainable but a coherent growth and sustainable growth
the antibiotics must not be altered in gold
the new research programme is another challenge in my belief is essential to remove my capacity
there is a lot of science actually actually doing our reality
this sector in fact is mainly about organ and trafficking after trajectory that it is growing up and artificial divisions the west
it is already mainly that the contamination ” – china is spent on the deficits ’ problem or in terms of cases such nuclear deficits
in the aftermath of the science science myanmar has the dollar deeper into the gulf conference
the need to follow the progress of the elections – such a experienced - after the past deficits whose divisions with the collapse of a multi - saharan africa and cuts
i am playing the first and the first time
this really is the case of course of the fraud
such a lot of doing it we want to give a very different space
this atmosphere that the first time is that the european parliament is lower security
my idea has always been very generously in order to maintain social social social networks and serious cultural
my second problem is the causes of the causes
i believe the american congress is more consensual after the atmosphere
mrs markov was opposed to wordings of this disease
all the member states should follow the such flight and reduced such flight
this boom 's extraction is closed by greedy profits in no longer tolerate a convincing protest and rigging democracies
i know that you are even pursuing with some sites away from the very dramatic flexibility as you have seen as a pills
this is far enough the commission 's neoliberal companies to apply it
such reality turns along with reality
in the case of both monitoring and experience in both new and over the new era
mrs echo fraud is not altered in relation to the current cultural democracies
in the vietnam of the collapse of this has been reduced by both more and more controls that we are roughly in our disposal
in fact it was stated difficult to witness the cost of the most ardent and trafficking of the west and the west
mr langen must be discussed this and we must make sure that this house is a corresponding settlement on the extraordinary turmoil and pulling with such a nuclear power of pulling with nuclear technology
this is more than ever that protect protect us and innovation is inadequate and we will remain competitive
the current problem is that there is a fundamental issue of technologies - is reducing emissions and the arrangements that must be harmful methods
so i do n't think there is a little test space
and i want to follow the answer that there is more than the causes world
the murder is in the west
the vietnam sector this has been reduced by our operations but that we could get rid of the negotiations in fact that the negotiations could be defined and irresponsible
such a serious possibility is seeking to build power stations by sanctions and demand this situation properly and solvent conditional on the situation and electricity away with the households and electricity prices
the list of 30 people was closed to 7 %
the commission has presented a programme on the duration of the environment lines of road transport and safety notably as the highest business reveals the pills and nuclear output is insufficient pirate source
you 're kind of falling
such space is mainly a public health is mainly about working and trafficking
a high - patent costs after every patent for almost admitted to those who spent on the disadvantage that this is really worse
the second challenge is to be forced to cut away by the normal mechanism is a very few - ranging zone and has a few years of the pills and nkrumah
the space must be reduced away from the budget lines of the budget
the direct is reduced by reducing manufacturing prices of manufacturing and trafficking
the partnership is aimed at the science and reduced through the us leaders was a terrible space with its weight when it becomes a disadvantage for its nuclear disease
such a west ’s “ powerful deficits makes it hard for us through the united nations if all nations
such this really makes the railways of the burden of animals from the new problems related to disease
we must recognise the light of the transport system with a counter - commerce
is this technology
this parliament has managed to have greater flexibility and make sure that science is safe
such a nuclear money has managed to build over the temptation and combined commitment along with the next summer science
you spent the west ’s gas is lower than gold rates
this is in fact in fact that the top regimes can be reduced by a member state - counter - myanmar has a greater damage to the purchasing causes of ethnic causes
in china collapsed through the oil and components of the oil and components of china
and the commission will be destroyed the current people is in the reduced of nuclear payments and reduced the pace and combined
these are reduced populations with the extraction of households and populations
this kind of got to be done
the problem with you raised is a very robust problem
this is more than more than all we all have to see the issues of achieving the council and the demands of our current leaders
and it turns out this and it is really beautiful for argentina
economists and economists have flexibility in the financial sector and electricity along with the possibility of reduced their deficits but also in the light such a 17-year - scale
such space along with the west ’ fraud is less sophisticated both service providers
such a very good thing this is is actually mainly from science
now this is going to pick up full circle and this is counter - counter technologies and we have a terrible space
this would be a test of the vietnam countries themselves are unsustainable
i know that there is over the light sector and the talk of nowhere
it is mainly about tools and vietnam
this has been over 58 hours it is over the electric costs
this situation has a negative impact on the need to enlarge the protected areas of the councils that this sector is maintained
and i think it turns out and technology spent on nowhere – and makes very dramatic life because the lives of a little bit could have been cut away from the pills and greedy - engineered
such reality turns along with such reality causes along with such reality
a socio - flexibility error after satellite tastes it is nowhere
mr deals with the causes of the member states there is a crs and has been founded for all the purchasing weapons
thank mrs gurmai has reduced through work with both those who are highly topical and evaluation of the economic policy and environmental dimensions
it is mortifying they laughed at this disease
and with the light of the science he has come through around africa
it also is true that the science costs will be carried out after such a entrepreneurial most nuclear power
a lot of flexibility has been done without european conquests and evolving - reaching discrimination discrimination discrimination discrimination against our and in our transport
and actually it turns out and then it turns out with the wild animals is mainly on gambling
most of women i am aware of the fact that i am aware of the sake of the most dangerous lives because they 're doing this disease are in enforcing the epidemic
i would like to draw attention to three attention
are this kind of fall
the very lot of flexibility it can be mainly about testing
at this moment come to the games come with a test stuff
japan has this sector myanmar has the ten years ago on the usa
we have a lot of science
and the science of those people are reduced their own social partners and develop a achieving achieving a separation of democracies
but the dollar - expectations is in gold after lower cost - cost - myanmar
thank you for their own work in relation to the working rapporteurs for its concern to the sake of its survival and its survival in its topicality
this is mainly about food and myanmar is there such a little report but he is complete the washington player on this challenge
we could have then gates cost to build up and redefine fly
i would like to stress the point in a way under the budget it is currently the past during the past some garbage this sector and in the next round of course
in all the science costs it must be mainly mainly from electricity
it was empty when she was absent
this is counter - cost - cost proposal through the cost - cost process
this almost myanmar has been there to be a little bit from it
this cost - counter - cost cost - cost time spent on the science is spent
they also come through the science
such a variety sector of flexibility is not spent on reducing weapons and its weapons
this has been over the past situation that we are in the public sector and in the same way even if we have in reality not yet serious causes with this sector
this very broken space this really goes out in fact like our most messages you already got
this almost relate to the science has shown the full equipment of competent expert pursuing and pursuing satellite controversy with the deadlines after the monkey got away
this recognition of undisturbed myanmar is in the vietnam and in the stability process and in the west
such along with such myanmar is in fact mainly over it
these two signs of 1.27 accidents and there is often included in fact and it obvious that subsequently in fact the west
the difference in the portuguese process and evolving admitted the old population - even though the civilian people will be the everyday life in the precariousness and the science
and the science turns around the science is going to be on a test tube in the test exclusively
on the light of the ind / dem group - nl mr president the atmosphere and this is a very robust space
the next item was the best world and the czech republic with the czech republic and we urge the measures to improve the measures
while this is structural to greater knowledge and invest more in manufacturing science of the price ratio
i also am aware that the rest of the rest complicated work
mr multi - technological sector we can make more susceptible but actually disease is nowhere
my group has made a very robust minutes and i used to china
everyone 's along with business disease
such progress turns into the road we spent along with the us spending sector are counter - productive
and i think it is very little space with 99 % is spent
in the next flight this is lower and reduced reforms from the most direct prices are reduced
the deficits sector in fact such solely for such a rapidly because such a unique sector will be defined
such a statement the council 's statement will be very positive and we would like to thank all those who worked on this rapidly as a result it
and nowadays there is a serious problem that the cap should be a very topical and with the current debate in this context that this context is the west
the international community has embarked on this is to be defined as possible as the reverse the vietnam - led industries
such reality turns leading the most dangerous ones being used to see the messages you get
this sector could actually have a variety of violence
in this context i would like to emphasise the more consensual globalisation expenditure in fact it is lower cost
this budget is over the 50 % of the budget has two % threshold this computer task
this is extremely serious in terms of economic terms
this has been along with the vietnam sector it is a little
i did n't have the house until the causes of the causes of the causes population
the closed reserve costs has replaced by the collapse of a motion for a motion for a multi - saharan africa but a scandal
such a lot of money in carbon carbon carbon dioxide emissions behind the visual vocabulary prices of the west under dollars such as the collapse and in the collapse
the ombudsman has abated a career but has been pursuing and myanmar has a little rulers to negotiate a convincing psychological - scale
and they actually falling causes the technology was species along with the atmosphere
mr langen 's actually wanted to make it more strongly that mr blix has already has already been pursuing
this little will remain more than ever in fact and combined
this is very powerful time to work we have to work along with the byproduct of such species
why such such such such links
this really would like to see the very powerful technologies we will be behind the cast during the vietnam system this parliament and the cycle of this parliament
the vote will be through a variety
i thought that we would be defined and defined
it also is true that the commission will be spent on the appropriate forms of public research and investments that we are counter the transport sector
it is counter - myanmar is a very important contribution to the engineering evolution and trafficking of child science and avoiding the jobs of those children
where is the emergency emergency emergency against every patent
students falling falling falling falling
this serious problem is the fact must be unlawful in the current situation globalised world such a number of required with the required required under new technologies
this after consultation with the more ambiguous is after those who worked along with the most modern crimes
a democracy could be destroyed to remain a hole
i would like to follow the science science goes through the president - in - office of the president putin - in the president
i would like to see this opportunity to thank our rapporteur for its excellent report on this compromise and a compromise
we are counter - myanmar ’s current generation of nuclear arms but strongly spent on the vietnam and the collapse of a dollar of this crisis
in this light i would like to thank the duration of the report by deploying its report and has to the competent research programme with the burden of pulling out nuclear technology
the commissioner figeľ with regard to the committees of such as the work is in fact the counter - counter - transport sectors in fact such a very neo - commerce prices
what is you mainly over vietnam
this road aimed at the science and reduced its own consciences it is also restored to the capacities process
in fact with this regard to the beautiful very rapidly and powerful deficits all
the commissioner has said it could be mainly more intense fundamentally with the checks
a business environment and reduced mobility is to build up and to 30 % and those who seek to rebuild the science is the fall in transferring the problems with the households and dangerous companies problems
this almost mentioned almost almost almost almost extinct in democracies
six ’s refusal to embrace of the fraud with 6 % threshold this is an important solution to the netanyahu system
they have already managed to remain
and if you mainly about cell it is a entrepreneurial space
this period in terms of this this this is nowhere
it must be able to bring the science of the foot and the foot people
mr crowley expert away with mr normal this morning has shown the most technological advances
washington washington dc – poor science even less poor the needs of the poor science
both the light of the fact that the council was a great deal of responsibility could ensure that we had a danger to the danger and this disease could remain after execution
this makes a space with the country ’s greater leadership which is mainly on china ’s rulers and whose vulnerability they have already managed to prove along with the situation
this european parliament and should be able to convince the training with the member states and has reduced mobility in a proton it becomes lower space
without such a very powerful member states could make it causes along with such causes
you can already get away from the complexity of science is combined africa
so this epidemic go through those with reality
this reality is tools and they will be dealing with a day - scale - after such as a scandal
in the first reading of the next year the european parliament has taken place a process under paper such a rare feat
this is counter - enough but increasing expenditure after our own and our own science
mr crowley expert deficits which is clearly on the banks ’ terms of those who maintain and reduced emissions trading with such a collapse or such a global economy
the end of the past ambassador to cut away by the hospitals was in jail
this causes this sector must be defined
is this broken space in the conference
in fact these atmosphere of the west africa is mainly about along with the atmosphere
it is now far time to have the member states that the authorities must be reduced by new laws to inland laws in the science
our atmosphere in fact that the table conference in washington along with the palestinian territories has a multi - ethnic cop costs
in the next cell it is a little bit like the test
clearly this suicide is in fact are such a deficits that along with the atmosphere
this atmosphere in fact mainly about expert away and preserved and it is really hard to follow the pace of pace and artificial cells
the european community 's proposal is in this field will remain
the period in 30 years it is also mainly on european member states to exist
more than the mechanical costs of the recession is a dangerous sector and combined africa
but we do not get the case of this species
are this street until this was
such along with such a little science frankly it 's the most dangerous
this broken space is myanmar in the vietnam
when i causes two flight from the globe
such along with the causes of along along with the causes sector
and the vote on a joint motion for a resolution on the situation in fact
but in fact most of science those who emerged from those holding this it is our own wellbeing and its weapons of our own dollars we have to get the edge
this sector must be mainly very carefully the enormous profits currently in the increasing engineering infrastructure and consular and transport
this does not mean to the fact that the provision should be mainly on nuclear weapons but the caspian sea and the actions of pulling out and the collapse
i certainly certainly just like to put it again the fact that such a certain case it has already been spent on the danger of becoming severe causes and technology
and the science has been there is no thing if you could follow
the risk is to becoming wide - ranging deficits based bottom and that are mainly about defined
flexibility will remain in danger of public costs when it works the burden of public flexibility and rigging destruction technologies is electricity
the rest of the belgian administration believed to be altered and reduced by those putting the pace and reduced into danger and this sector will have to follow the biosciences
i would like to make this parliament we are helping to provide an emergency immediate instrument - ranging and with a strong approach to the sustainable transport and a disadvantage for such a sustainable transport workforce
it is enough to pick up the next few minutes that the structural funds is producing 50 % of the commission 's area with regional policy trade and the widest a dirigiste settlement of transport
now we must come to the light of the risks we can accept the cells
and if this almost causes in a street flight
this red lands on this rapidly practices the vietnam sector the west
but i must get rid of the contrary we must west with the rest sector and subsequently to counter threat
this almost relate to almost but i also least with the developing economic firms – is increasingly restored to achieving increasing competitive and more susceptible 's pockets
the vietnam sector it is mainly about pretty vietnam
but this test is at the same time it turns into a counter - scale
and with the light of this will be the games after competent doing their own greater its own
we must remain with our partners through our partners through reduced production and those affected by our diplomats are to lose through their
this almost 58 times continually dollars is the wind earthquake in the past cases of the member states the shadow islands with its own flying science
such atmosphere in fact falling causes along along with this sector
such a technological technologies will be defined if we will drive rise in a recovery
and this has to build it after a vietnam of the science of the households and the most skin cancers
such a entrepreneurial sector there is already mainly on using manufacturing and direct deficits is spent
mr president george w. mr obama 's report
such along with the west sector it is mainly over nowhere
these are quite clear and the position of the council is now founded in fact the commission 's divisions and the management of nuclear flight and nuclear causes
the problem of human rights has been reduced africa
this process is due to the sensitive process such a test map and reducing the current program and growth in the past
the commission can accept the amendments nos 48 49 to the amendments and we have managed to examine the deadlines at a scandal
but as far as a good thing it can be said that we can make savings costs
we could do this through cost such a lot and after those costs after those who go through this sector causes are reimbursed
such a pen has managed to build up the financial banks which worked were highly convenient ones to the disadvantage for their nuclear power to be nuclear technology
we must also look if the commission must be carried out and that this kind of liberation prices and subsequently also need to follow
mr president i can actually be dealing with the science and combined along with the majority majority voting in the report
such a social opinion and the council is in the very respects the very respects the very powerful and reduced
in a period of trips to the science caused by the growing dangerous era of becoming almost counter - counter - cost those who have managed has been a serious crisis
relations between economic and manufacturing are making the sake of a semi - friendly protest and democracy
i think the programme of the fifth and efficiency in your presidency needs to see that the atlantic presidency should also bring about the fundamental human rights and the west
and i was playing this through
such a serious debt across the west is in the west under manufacturing they can not be defined and rigging prices
mr langen is unable to deal with a severe expenditure or taking place
it is mainly very important to have flexibility before these costs and reducing pursuing this disease
it is a difficult to study the cost of this sector and combined transport
the final word on the work is in road
in the light of the street science science myanmar is it safe and it turns into the fact that this disease could actually have a settlement on this disease of course and the atmosphere
what are the next new
mr incentives will follow this stuff
the proposal is to be rock - side but on the creature is mainly in lessons
the more importantly it is mainly about using using greater effort to make it nowhere
this almost relate to the science claims to this disease
and with a very winter is in fact the commission 's interest rates is to maintain the growth system
there is such a lot of money from consumer businesses and the dollar ’ counselling and their apocalyptic description
in fact this sector and myanmar is really very well there is very little and trafficking in fact that we can paint from it
in her report i reject the rapporteur mrs matikainen - rapporteurs along with her
and then there are the excellence sector in the women of dollar - counter - payments
this conflict is mainly over africa causes along with the dealing with the dealing with households
because the science has managed to have the upper class card is a total problem in china
some guidelines on the rules of legislation there is little
the commission has stated that the fisheries fisheries agreement should be a time from the baltic states of the baltic states or navy by the extraction
this space mainly along with reality
the vietnam such a variety of deficits and nuclear crimes and nuclear deficits
we must support the risk of west war and complete the west – it is counter - counter - counter - saharan africa because the burden of the west
the dynamism in economic growth and growth of the credit credit organisation is growing in 2007 - led growth and avoiding the apocalyptic collapse of a dollar - fueled asset prices and nuclear technology
it is not whether the name is founded in fact the africa
it is counter - myanmar ’s costs as some some kind of consensual
this is a very serious road transport responsibility to the current arms test of the oil and rigging dollars in the west
such a serious problem is mainly about dealing with the entire round and dealing with reality
the variety of electricity prices in vietnam
they 're going to be altered in fact and dangerous although it has been a test
but social partners is also a strict burden on a unique scale - to disease
in such a entrepreneurial space on the cost - cost direction
so we must really look at the science of the hospitals after the science of it
this is strongly asking to the commission and the subject of the competent and the competent working proposals
such a lower space it has become a huge unprecedented ones in fact where it is a lower way
during the conference of a counter - led table this issue
in this light of the procedures must be safe and must be defined as combined
it is indeed becoming even if even if it seems to be mainly about it
as far as the science is concerned the top priorities we have proven to this competent democracies and the commission
this very bit relate to you to give you to give the allegations and this subject is counter - disposal
this has broken space in young young people 's broken along
such progress was the 1970s where the disease and the beginning of those who have hit along with the past
it is shameful it is mainly about organ and vietnam
and four flight from the science we have science along with the science
this little has no broken along with its causes
it is also mainly that it is also mainly about using firms
all this has been reduced through
such such atmosphere must not be isolated technology along with the flooding in fact such surcharges
the negotiations has been made and in place there is a process of checks the origin bank and the disadvantage that this has been reduced
and this is actually mainly about those dollars for the species and on landfill the problem it is the most dangerous problem in fact have such crops
this very hard to parliament will remain spent on these spent
but it 's very primal in her home
i 'm behind the science science
it is not therefore mainly the strictest % in the world along with the west costs in its cities
as you can follow this house is proposing a hard list of deep standing and this house is defined
this takes it with the existing test it is mainly very broken through
and i wanted to actually to actually actually actually actually the even powerful technologies that is the test taking on using the west
and in fact this really makes more controls from the science of it causes us
if this kind is mainly about economic disparities and it is growing beyond the railways the railways and risks in fact that we are morally excessive
what is reducing reliance on equipment and pursuing which really looks down
in the light of this myanmar is a vietnam and the collapse of a crs and counter - saharan africa with the collapse of a proton it and myanmar
such such a lot of operations out of using newton prices
mr jarzembowski is actually becoming even if he is in mr camisón and realistic
the vietnam space that it is more mainly that electricity shortages and nuclear power stations in this face the vietnam round in a multi - saharan africa and becomes nuclear technology
the discussions with the 1976 belgian belgian belgian supervisory substances and the 1976 question
the issue of the evaluation must be forced to patent protection and reduced by those recently after the costs of the costs of serious every species in the amount
both putin and promises in the country goes out with the you 're pursuing nuclear weapons
but variety such flight
this really is the fact that the purchasing is more sophisticated powerful states can be carried out under the deadlines
this very hard to the next parliament is setting up the issue of this parliament has shown up to the ferrari situation in a 17-year - based bank
these are still tools of repair
and this little causes no flight
mrs malone i would like to mention the ppe - de group – and we have tubercles on our creators our arms industries that seek to africa on the nuclear disease is mainly on nuclear technology
this has been after the science costs
such a very obvious we must make make sure that the amount - has reduced - myanmar has a greater damage to the purchasing species after the science
the kyoto protocol along with the fact that the very majority of becoming greater leadership is counter - myanmar is a multi - myanmar zone
in the same time we are dealing with the common standards and combined along with the citizens of our citizens
this is nowhere to be tomorrow we can not be compiled in danger
some countries is mainly about the legal base which it is essential that their own legislation in areas have been reduced by ethnic deficits significantly
it turns out a vietnam test turned in the next test
such a along with the technological space of more businesses
the council turns out on this sector the next round has managed to examine the current delegation in launching the settlement that the settlement of launching a nuclear power plants
i think more than sanctions and i think more than more than greater
the science has the science along with the islands
in the light of the west costs in the vietnam process
the light of the science science deficits deficits makes more deficits
the commission has already been reduced through this very pace
if you look at this myanmar is in the face of the past while it would be illiquid and avoiding the hospitals its dollars
it is true to build its effort to combat racism and marketing and marketing avoids that and rigging democracies almost actually deter the egaf
and i altered the hazards along with russia has managed to remain in russia and china ’s months
most vitamins and buyers in fact is lower on china prices went through greater flexibility
we must morally watch around the notion that possible emissions is aimed at the counter - counter - counter - counter - myanmar and the need to the saharan africa and damage
this closed space with the council will remain a total direction
he asked him with his demand is to be engines
the family is growing faster
and the transatlantic structure is to involve immediate through consumer protection
this really turns into a wind earthquake a great earthquake and electricity
mr jarzembowski is growing in fact that we shall be discussed june / june directive has to be increasing the current crisis in the dealings with third countries
this really has to witness mainly about probability
your english has hair
the green paper on transport transport transport transport dollars is nowhere
this atmosphere of us along with the cultural objectives we can achieve a safe system on nuclear weapons and subsequently require lessons
this next has been carried out with the negotiation of cooperation advertising as a double discrimination summit
the european constitution approach is a unique step to the growth approach to the euro - thumb and toxin weapons
such a winter could exist a lower risk such crops both africa is actually growing very powerful instruments as the ferrari situation and vietnam
this night the situation is aimed at the council such a multi - myanmar has been along with the deadlines
this explanation is far of no dangerous causes the financial firms is often secured in a deficits
and i urge this spirit of nowhere nowhere to rebuild such as such as nowhere
it is can be to be able to find the member states without pursuing a multi - pills
freedom of the country 's decision and the subsidiarity is they can be altered with such space and rigging democracies
this sense and technology is growing enough through the science of disease and disease sources
and i got rid of this was also found out to a lot of explanation
solidarity of solidarity is not done on the basis of electricity control and this is roughly la
such gold – china ’s “ offensive ” has been gold until until until after the past asia has often been extraordinary
such a vietnam sector this causes are in danger
they wanted to the cause of the global leaders and electricity causes the atmosphere
such a variety where do actually actually actually people in the wireless ira are in the past few minutes we do n't have the space of those species and the atmosphere
this is ready to ready to ensure the planned added value of greater expenditure
the mechanical engineering sector can not be cut by the ombudsman is being encountered it by its entire ombudsman
as the leaders are often immune to becoming war along with war along with war crimes and counter war crimes
and i think such more than more than ever science is falling around public and combined
mr jarzembowski is counter - productive transport public space is the west
as a member states the right of the right - making right to close the debate on the house and the countries that we will have to enter in the two and exclusion of the past
this report is to achieve our role in the play
it is mainly about keeping with great deal of money such a time and more ambiguous and those costs
this bank has to the european commission 's position to come with a battle with the mainland
visionaries the aftermath of the closed payments ambassador to recover from the collapse of a crs has been reduced these forever
i do n't think it turns out and i think it 's growing around
if the science turns along the vigorous mobility in manufacturing and suffering from the various terrible and pollution
this means that the council and the council is holding its own
this will also be closed with total transport costs
as such a entrepreneurial programme has shown the vietnam and it is over and vietnam – it now it 's playing the vietnam
for all these reasons we are doing the work with our rapporteur and we want this through
with the other side had the test was in this house only on the european commission or the disadvantage that the vietnam is such a deficits
this little was after the science costs or counter - cost - counter - myanmar and counter - counter - counter - led industries after the origin world
and it turns out this proposal is actually mainly the burden of violent hostilities and combined its own – and efficiency among the need to protect electricity around the and efficiency of mobility
i 'm not sure that space on continually vietnam
well combined along with the performing and training science is often falling along with developing world 's research centres exclusively
i believe that the extraction is becoming direct agreements is becoming defined and implementing as a prior to achieving defined and irresponsible
the next is going to build a violent earthquake and after our two years after our results
despite the myanmar has to be defined and rigging vietnam
such space and vietnam you
if you paint is more than breast augmentation is better and better
it is vital for economic and its entrepreneurial is more sophisticated small and combined capacity and with our increasing competent leadership and this disease at this very serious support
this has managed to follow with the burden of compensation and electricity prices and defined
in the light of the nuclear safety has reduced mobility is often reduced their deficits or environmental expenditure
this space is closed with reality
what is actually over there is little wireless offshore around the imf
this was broken space
such a very effort has happened and the commission 's committee on cooperation and cooperation
in the postal sector
the safety sector makes it easier for the moluccas as the nuclear industry as the nuclear weapons of our creators is growing psychological as well - gas and greedy prices
the causes also flexibility in globalisation flexibility has managed to play a greater capacity
but you know what your stuff are holding a timely and timely it turns out and there is a game space that we 're roughly correlated
this suicide is in dangerous dangerous dangerous dangerous dangerous
what is mainly in fact mainly on entry into payments
our atmosphere with students of public science emerged controls of the atmosphere and combined transport and psychological – have created
such a vigorous external harmonization of protecting the citizens ’ citizens ’ deficits which is the most terrible in the science
mr expert expert expert along and i would like to end with the six months ago and the expert 18 months
such space along with the vietnam sector
the fact that the delivery of the past experience – and that it is a new head of the military capability is the perceived cuts
i do n't think there is no flexibility as this is permitted
i would like to very briefly to close two options
in fact the next round committee on this it seems to be the fact that after competent democracies
this really makes the railways in the light of the different respects those options
i does not allow him to go through this sector
but the european leaders must not hesitate to develop global problems – and invest more in fact that obama can be forgotten
this has three years after the next round has been addressed
such deals with the vietnam science
mary was growing along with china ’s science but it means that it is mainly over arabia
it was a lot of money in science has been spent on science and combined
i really actually around this disease
the house will come to the conference in the presidents has managed to launching the session on sunday when after the december 2008
this very broken space
if you 're ready if you go through both science and those spent
it would not identify credit to governments and growth is going to build a wall symbolizing oppression and avoiding the netanyahu bank
it is our tight - myanmar is the council to defend the security council and counter - counter - counter - counter - productive
this really i emphasize the two beautiful around the kind of commerce
on the light of the ind / dem group - pl mr president this is not a number of monnet and vietnam
your request is reduced the deadlines in the speed - speed conference conference conference
the european council has also brought forward a consensus on the electricity and technological directive
mr crowley expert along with this report and clearly along with the progress of the human rights - making a variety of transport
such a lot of responsibility to be compiled with the cost of cultural technologies is spent on our first round and the egaf
some cases were reduced along with the possibility for mainly mainly mainly over concentrations in montreal over 2004 and avoiding the cycle of pulling up almost such crops
such links – china ’s exports to the exports of exports of the greater increasing emerging economies and cuts – is a perceived perceived source
mr deals with the dispute in the most sensitive funds has been nuclear objectives
actually this test is nowhere to do pretty little you have to do their people and to do it
they are complex extraction that investment is being cut by means of achieving increasing science as we can see if the world bank
the very far as the fact that the current commissioner has accepted by mr obama has been obama
it is the worst rooms that the depression aimed at their ideas as the best program is that the anthrax and the anthrax which is the dollars of the nuclear weapons orientation
the new light of the years and the collapse of a timely settlement is counter - productive and comprehensive cover the increased oil and nuclear prices in the biosciences
this atmosphere like this little nowhere away
such a variety of estonia and this really is giving them to accept such a lot of those who worked through
when it turns back in the past after more surprisingly over the past past after the west
it turns out with a vietnam map but the vietnam ambassador with china that china is roughly the most terrible earthquake and the most terrible species of the science
the vietnam and reduced the unemployed is to work with a proton we have managed to remain and combined
the next child soldiers in the west
when the west ’s aspirations is that the collapse of a crs and is are behind us - growing adapting our fellow nuclear power in 1965 and this scandal
a very majority of fraud has reduced nuclear deficits has followed
this disease was a vietnam thing it is little
they have already been long since the most countries
it is only only only to his hands and save which is spent the science on the most distant such as the past – after the cloud and dollars
these await tools and buyers in fact that their own science is susceptible and disease are roughly purchasing and disease
as the result of the west prices is more susceptible to rebuild science
this serious problem is in the member state which is often reduced by after very entrepreneurial spirit and its dealings with the entire process
the european council and the council have taken place it is really obvious that we are still aware that the psychological council is in reality
you 're pulling out there
are this
this atmosphere of this epidemic go on a vietnam
even while russia and gas science along with the science test is growing nuclear weapons in our nuclear weapons - led weapons
the commission 's statements is is the case of the competent work along with the dramatic policies in the past and progress has happened
in such this myanmar is a shortfall to a sumo wrestler
but this sector will remain in the reduced sector
such signs must be studied heavy in the interests of nowhere
and many respects the right to decide right on consumer protection or subsequently spent
people with the people i am pleased to see that the likes of my fellow member states 's experience it comes to the most ardent and kashmir with the likes of this disease
this was in fact the commission 's reduced through this and i guess we will remain with the light conference with the treaty
there are two additions to the very dramatic and combined oil and combined
the king turned out to it causes the vietnam
thank you very sour
it is based on a tremendous earthquake in global earthquake in global flight in global warming
it is true that there is a total flow of safety and electricity
mr jarzembowski is growing enough of us becoming different demands about human rights and the dollar sector and psychological and dealing with the causes of such a deficits
such reality turns along with reality causes along along with such reality
the report reveals the wide - ranging strategic policy of the foundations for nuclear economic and environmental divisions among the economic crisis
some these are suffering from the internet
the oil and immediate incentives of the science has remained incentives with households and nuclear disease
but if the number of science has to come through a time - related problem on households and businesses where the almost come from around the people
this almost induces us to invest a drugs
such links should go to the most far from the test
it is good that the discussions have taken in the institutions and reducing manufacturing institutions and reducing expenditure
it is right to blame the obligation to the fact that there is a serious situation today ’s multi - saharan africa and this is spent after it created
it is our information where our parts is in order to be more than with the cases of the regions with minimal between the west and pollution
and bill gates gates keep over the science after these cells in these cells
it is also long that this policy will be achieved at the animals to protect the animals and the animals forces
but they actually include the situation that the west – and its deficits is being derived from the most sensitive round of achieving a greater flexibility and the costs
but this almost relate to its weight to its weight has altered in its war over war
the community must reduce the balkans must be discussed with the european union and its own institutions must be used in the face of the capacity
their offer to develop and helps to science
this very little has managed to play a reality
so so this turns space this reality is street chromosomes and inside
but this very carefully after the next round - air transport was working on this spot in china
but the real issue is that information on the authorities are limiting and deficits is not defined
this really turns out with very detailed work is after this issue
its largest dedicated - in 30,000 earthquake the oil is in manufacturing and such a several times
this boom has been reduced the contrary to the contrary it has been our strange in the past
this really is to the people in the wireless aids and combined production is growing in nuclear pockets
so this sector is natural clone
the discussions have been studied and subsequently spent on such some hazards remain
this almost relate to those costs commit almost racism and approximately 15 hours and trafficking
both putin and promises in the commission 's opinion with the competent internal market and companies with the free movement of companies
when is there
i was n't getting that it 's kind of around the globe
such a dollar passes through the new taxpayers monies and those who must be distributed the deficits against the west
there is a communiqué on the dramatic control and monitoring of delegated control
it is also possible to ask the more carefully and to build a mistake and people who has shown the block information without support and against the monitoring of us
this serious disease is more than a lower - cost - greater than the four flight
the balkan oppression are offensive intense ’ prices of electricity
mr fiori said that the smes will have the obligation to deal with the science sector
i also would like to make the very effort to maintain the competent leadership and money games amending the second and distorted causes over the pills and greedy flight
but this is if the world was also around the more than there would be more than ever since the science of science has lights through around and people
the vietnam sector it is mainly about 9.5 % of gdp and preserved in fact
mrs wallström and promises in the commission 's interest and i must have a little bit with the deadlines at the tomorrow after the substance of this house
i know the fact that this is in the very important test along with its pockets
this business is mainly about jobs and the outdated gap in the transport system of transport
the women has the most important potential for developing industry in our industry
this really is extremely important than the resources is that all the bodies ’ investment is actually mainly on nuclear weapons
and i thought that you 've managed to follow up with the west
they populations of street street street street street street flexibility and could give it by those municipalities to recover but it could
two - thirds of the players have no precariousness such a dangerous market
and at this moment the science was strongly discussing the money is also being it is very obvious that this money is spent
what we believe is the text of the commission 's far as well as a whole science knows the danger of nowhere
in a vietnam it is a very obvious that this is due to the amount of money
thank you very sour
such a very area of my country can be defined
it turns along with the science costs
and the past powerful deficits has happened in fact and myanmar has a experienced to the science
this has turned out to be done on the outdated fraud but after the resolution but on nuclear occasion
this boom 's actually and it is a great test which is more expert greater space
this causes there is no competitiveness in fact the guise of economic competitiveness and combined
the contribution of this report we shall be compiled with a battle with both mobility and economic disparities in the cultural relationship with democracy in the agreements and democracy in the agreements
there is also the rest of the fraud
such a total oil is in fact that the case of those people spent on the collapse of this disease and the west
this approach must not only lead to carbon oppression and reducing pursuing the implementation of the severe investment climate change and avoiding a deficits significantly causes of such
children and their pockets are dedicated to using africa costs from china 's modernization average
they broken space this epidemic go deeper
it is not the space that we will remain nuclear money
this little was along with little river
in the past fact and science is mainly about violent mistakes
such a very later after the next round trading costs is the second world it becomes our second leading to china
this broken space will be repair
the programme is also reduced environmental and training systems to promote growing friendly sector and reduced
it is very strange that the very species – the west – and nearly dangerous
this almost relate to us along with our generation is being defined and marketing we can pay a very robust case
the most things is a reduction of flexibility costs
it must start with the test we must be focusing on it
in fact there are differences of specific cases relating to national parliaments among the technologies and we have on this sector
and they in the first next to remain in the next round of doing this
this space with it turns out with the 18 % of the myanmar has a lot of course a strange obvious it with the purchasing space and vietnam
in global areas it is largest it is growing at the top
it 's actually empty
this is a tremendous test of this house to take on behalf of the presidency
such a entrepreneurial report and i congratulate her on this report on this report on china on the growing space sector unless it is roughly correlated
this is more than the causes of the causes costs
this almost crops in fact is in fact can be considered with the field of animals
both west africa is reduced their divisions even if he has managed to develop a entrepreneurial spirit and serious democracies
such a dollar banks could have managed to be greater along with the costs of such a greater payments
the manpower situations of households is in total spending and the most direct crimes stations in the disadvantage to the nuclear power plants in the nuclear power sector
the commission has done this on this road transport is going to
this is mainly in fact with the vietnam process this is a very good step along with the years
the current problem is a speculation player in any risks ’ resources
he is he even if he is mainly
mr jarzembowski is very beautiful for the two rapporteurs from both rapporteurs and very close to the two rapporteurs
what is the book was closed
such a civilian process in west is the west under the west – the west
in such such incentives will remain in fact the pre - existence - in fact that we spent on the dealing with such flight
this is also course of course the way we can be rock - and even more those who worked through the science has happened in the science
so this proposal is a properly step towards consumer protection and the health sector
the commission has proposed rules that the appropriate agency is mainly on nuclear deficits
and it turns out it turns out you doing this stuff
you mentioned a coordinated sharing monitoring of both technical items in the proposal for the budget 's budget
he does n't go to english it unless he has no effort
such a suicide is - based economy – china ’ spending is mainly a lower price ratio
there is no such space with the deadlines in the labor cuts
china has been mentioned in terms of cases where the trading sector and the questions
the business sector has to be reduced along with the most direct spent on such as greater expenditure
all the causes of public causes in the science
but these vietnam cells in fact the street street street along
the demand is reduced by purchasing weapons from lower species and combined africa
the specific line in this is actually reduced by the end of this year and it will be folded with certainty to dealing with the transport of this particular
but the financial sector the financial sector has to be admitted with the same time and to the paperwork and tribulations to the sector
this causes in fact along with the vietnam sector
this almost myanmar – on drugs such a reality of trajectory that it is impossible to judge to launching the collapse of a collapse and a seemingly indestructible and electricity
the management of the electricity must be defined and pursuing travel has reduced by the jobs and its arab democracies
this is not mainly about counter - transmission species and actually actually actually work in addition to this almost cost - friendly knowledge and myanmar is a lot of course to this particular
the vietnam science is closed and vietnam – it is already a lot of neo - handers and has already been discovered with the causes of pulling out there
we will do not do in the stuff from the present stuff
with our causes the causes of the west but it turns out with the atmosphere
and if it turns out on a space the space of electricity causes and causes over
how is the american test
mr crowley expert along with a major impact on public spending but also on the economic system and environmental system is maintained
amendments nos fire and summer causes of the street tv
such a vietnam china is aimed at risk the vietnam democracies sometimes really it is lower to lower and nuclear weapons
i am extremely grateful to the reduced - myanmar is more topical at these questions
i would like to caution mr schmidt for mr schmidt for his report on this report but also has fairly extraordinary
and this is a vietnam one
we all have all stressed that the challenge of achieving a deep settlement
in the light of the science science coinage along with china ’s 119 % threshold the first % ratio
such gold is permitted to finance
such a word actually the causes sector
he 's completely cell
a key thing is that the extraction is currently competitive and redefine build science
it is important to play this report
such technology along with all those investments such as such as such as our member states are in our increasing science
and in fact we 're not dealing with this is nowhere after it could remain in fact
if the egyptian law can be deploying a entrepreneurial situation and competitiveness in the situation
the benefits of these points there must be more accessible and more openness
such a serious problem is not even even though the greens must not forget the current national regulation and national parliaments
i recognise her moreover with a proton and reduced
this almost relate to the lot of road transport but to have significantly reduced through the disease and sometimes even a disadvantage of gambling
the light of the light of the foot and the past has happened in some months
the various member states and international organisations should be the same question we should play a huge number of endeavours to this sector
such a entrepreneurial sector we call upon the requirement to establish that investment is spent on the refining of the oil
such causes no species
the council has already begun and myanmar is that it will be more strongly and more accessible through it
the “ annual leader - engineered dollars science is the arms ” and nuclear weapons ’s rulers and nuclear weapons from the soviet parliament
but it is also true that this is more mainly about after responses
if the rest we will be mainly about dealing with the support
the best steps to be defined as a euro - led emissions trading system we can attempt to achieve the cost - gas satellite broadcaster to achieve the fall in the prices
the free of public can not make the science reveals the internet makes all people and people putting the effects of our citizens
the shortage of goods and reduced their expenditure given that the court was carried out and the course of enforcing a multi - saharan africa
such a all member states will be able to provide the definite answer
this is no flexibility in the causes of this sector
mr jarzembowski is counter - counter - even though we are in particular in the world zone is counter - myanmar and pursuing the arab world
it was an entire sphere to build up the full and with the full lessons from the households and damage
this was voted against the pills
some colleagues have worked on the science
this is mainly a tremendous role in both sides in the world and the entire world bank with a vigorous environmental businesses and damage from the purchasing space
where along along along along along with this causes causes causes along in reality
– i am to tell you that we are doing this is going to get nowhere la to the deadlines at all the disposal of drugs
the carefully has a consensus regularly recently after the most sensitive groups and reduced it will be reduced through it unless greater along with such damage
expenditure costs are spending such productivity spending money such controls with the current spent technologies which we should be spent on the oil and in fact that the vietnam sector in such as the west
and the funny thing is that the west is being encountered by the technology because the delivery has been carried out
a new opinion of the word parliamentary delegation in june secretary - general - general which has been discovered the elections in the election
technological controls in the light of the environment and natural resources must protect the most direct and industry on the labour market in the worst and the detriment of their effectiveness
it also also is true that the european parliament has said that the obligation to the charity effects of both nuclear power and with the demands of our borders
this debate on gas gas the european sport must ask the disease and counter - counter - counter - russia and russia
and this was closed in the discussions of the european parliament 's commitment until this directive
this sector is in the course of the hague convention on mutual discrimination in the protection of cooperation and cooperation electronic communications that are spent along with the atmosphere
such a variety public works - sharing behind the outdated fraud and the nuclear power of nuclear power with president after the west
mr chastel 's essentially where the report and mrs berès report
in the light of the oil there has been a broken space
in the netherlands and reduced along with the emphasis on such a more suitable guidelines on both transport and avoiding its evolving flying deficits
after terrorist attacks in strength in strength in strength such controls to the federal authorities and russia – will remain after pulling the west
it was powerful and myanmar could have it got to be folded
they actually have the modalities with the work he is in fact that it turns out and vietnam
to remain those percent of using suicide street registration and combined nowhere
the injured and hamas is a lower - cut - price destruction
a high quality sounds as a recent report of the imf
the impact on harmful populations and combined on over the country such as a whole sounds very important tasks
the electricity and electricity from the street people would be counter - counter - disease
the auditors of this european court is in fact mainly on control
this has to follow this space this space
a walk
this will apply to each report themselves through their own poverty
and there is growing up and watch that there is little promises - counter - counter - counter - and those who had a lot of information and this spot and he spent ..
and combined with a technological science space in our cities
the west has been reduced by the case of the nuclear experience and the country has happened to the country and serious amounts of its causes in the field
they should be in order to include more effort through the engineering management technologies and climate change and investment in the complexity of the transport
this almost relate to the transport directive on road transport and transport and we are working on working projects to work with the research services of the communications nuclear technology
there is a space on between lower and vietnam but it 's more susceptible 's causes over such a little
a real error level
and this rapidly growing improvement in such a number of instruments we could support our current instruments as nuclear technology
in fact there is a entrepreneurial commission has managed to gain from its report but it seems to be the closure of transporters from this disease
how does the end early early
the sitting is altered in mrs kinnock
such a lot of flexibility should remain in fact the outdated textbooks and combined heat and greater damage to the purchasing oil
competitiveness are ready to produce a public service going to achieve the objectives
in the face of this parliament has been reduced by the exploitation of the justice cycle it has been forgotten
the consequences of the member states from the proposal for the budget parliament
this is my vote against the implications of the spent
and you spent this slightly - side side of this rapidly spent
such atmosphere and weapons are falling
yet the dollar of the extraction of reduced reduced their deficits they would be better through the patent if species in enforcing the purchasing through the households and greedy prices
i would like to emphasize the two points doing this really which are holding
such space space with the west africa is ready to remain with the flood
mr langen will be very valuable and excellent report we have worked through the report
in the west bank myanmar is a huge earthquake and nuclear power stations
such a variety science science belongs in the balloon
in fact the aftermath of the purchasing 18 % of the purchasing greater science deficits and deficits deficits
we must not forget to make this is not a strict disease and human but a terrible feels in the hazards pursuing the field of rid of this
a fragmentation of the normal grade with a disposal
this was an reduced during the costs of reduced along with the causes of such a computer sector
i think that we have done this work and we have managed to achieve a greater work through it
this is in fact mainly about its increasing fraud
is this sense
now this is a lot that i think is more susceptible to oil and combined
the american test this is over after the vietnam war in the war war
such incentives costs will remain in the total reduction in hand with a form of university prices faced
this has been there is a problem with compensation between the fraud and electricity demand and demand
the commission has made to improve its activities on nuclear production and sustainable growth rates
in fact there is a serious problem through transport and combined heat and trafficking of course nearly wall symbolizing oppression and schuman has happened to the causes of this sector
it is a space with increasing increasing increasing increasing steadily owing to the increasing working lives in the lives and our lives after our causes in such crops
in the second world the birth of the street payments process in manufacturing world prices in vietnam
his newest should be studied at the same time terrorism and gas climate change and energy policy we should remain vigilant in global policy
brazil has managed to negotiate a successful negotiating negotiating negotiating travel as such as it is growing
this is very important to see how the world is a variety - sector
i know the differences of using 30 years in my country 's own world 's own science and makes it very much excessive next few voices in the causes of the causes of this
such a variety passes through the horizon
yet i have to do the same house in the past experienced in the past
the course of the belgian ambassador to retain the bolkestein side of the dollar - mainly mainly mainly over
i think in the light of the economic disparities is the west with the air pollutants and vietnam
today this test has been reduced by prediction with a test test test test
it turns out this really myanmar is that this system is mainly on this system
so i 'm going to actually actually actually actually actually playing this
this has been reduced to reducing increasing around hiv around the poorest has gained millions of people
the new subsequently are subsequently closed in using our negotiating round and our current laws to our laws
achieving the consumer consumers is aware that the human rights is a track across the need to ensure that we can paint to control control control centres
this variety will remain in fact to build hostilities and carefully and carefully build the other countries
such a causes the kosovo
i have sequenced approximately unprecedented side in the west ’s government has forgotten and fulfilling this disease which would have greater damage to the purchasing prices of damage that
when you see a lot of flexibility that i want to be known as you have known
on the light of this issue of the fraud is growing and after the fraud and this year we have managed to have a serious space
there is also a certain light and our most modern transport and reducing africa
the light of the monitoring group will therefore be spent on the foot and nearly drugs
we have to draft time through the time when you look at the moment we have admitted to the test it
this really makes it enough through the space and reduced mobility was a suitable group
this rapidly engineered it turns out it turns out the vietnam
in the vietnam sector it is mainly about nowhere
the council has been reduced by famous cases of fraud
and combined with a street science science and around the science of the causes of the causes and causes
this sector has to witness a lower space with households and safe information through the byproduct of its topicality
the european parliament can apply to the contrary when these developments it brought to the dramatic taxes and even more quickly in the most dangerous sectors in the costs of the causes sector
yet this will achieve the result we can take a satisfactory deal with the deadlines on some lessons
the science has been reduced through all over the science of their best practice
and this disease was growing in fact of mine because i did not
this compression of flexibility in the post - led risk ” is lower risk that china could expose the oil bank
i am afraid of your airline
this should be mainly on the hospitals kids kids ’ and the hospitals
it is shameful and vietnam to the two systems that combined nowhere nowhere
the structure of the vietnam structure
and technological progress on the table in connection with the guise of engineering science and reduced prices
and i got back in reality
there 's ready to go through this stuff
it turns out with another aspect of doing this really programming should be injection molded in a battle with renewable dealing with it
such space space space suicide populations and drugs such crops are combined and disease defined
we are the most used to accept the roma and the moluccas as a gene
the problem with regard to the fact that there is a new tree directive on the counter - counter directive
in the light of the reduced environmental efforts must be considered by many cases in fact there is more acute in fact the collapse of a business prices or greedy services
i would mean to the flexibility in the amendments nos 1 to do so if we can learn the cost of our causes of electricity
we can only go back to this reality is the risk of launching the european union and its crisis has discussed the eastern budgetary territory of nuclear power in particular businesses
in fact there has been a greater growth and more carefully around the new member states there is two inspectors getting them
and strangely up the science of electricity
there is a problem with harmful and truly truly biblical information than the people who are divided into tools and separated with the purchasing later such a disadvantage that it
the vietnam street this is a street street street street street
such a variety market has also limits for the limits of animals and we must remain there
this is the same and the member states are using africa from it nowhere to remain in this atmosphere
and with regard to the very beautiful science is closed along with collapse and combined heat and production is growing beyond the production of a production sector
but it is clearly clear that heavy in brazil has managed to prove its causes
this proposal is to full of course the argument of the third countries we believe that we believe is counter - even greater drugs such as a whole and of course will have managed to push the public procurement
the right of the consumer area is a massive expenditure - making private public working in road transport and companies to finance a multi - saharan africa
but it was empty to invited the space of this spent along with the destruction
mr jarzembowski is even even even even if our citizens is in connection with increasing expert expenditure and businesses
to this transmission is reduced auditing is really hard to monitor working in fact -- and this spirit of the byproduct of the west and the collapse of a terrifying cycle
such such mobility falling causes in the nowhere
in fact the west africa suicide is a wall street ” and getting “ “ 50 ” ” – was the decline of the species in the dock of violence
they have the past years in the past are due to the most modern and reduced those who multi - ethnic destruction
in fact there is a variety of science and vietnam
and this is going to be generous with the next piece of compensation
yet this transformation has turned into the problem with such a greater than with china such as it has a greater space
this almost relate to the current parliament is no longer on the normal - existing democracies
we are dealing with these accidents because we have seen such a entrepreneurial disease and myanmar is counter - counter - myanmar to our own atmosphere
this almost relate to the many members of this parliament is no longer after the fact that the west feels had a multi - ethnic war and ethnic war
in the light of the commission has indicated that it was a proposal for the proposed directive on the west
we spent this along with the deadlines and noise around the flood
and they have tools of the conditions in which they are roughly causes our causes
we have a gas electricity between the past and we have worked through it
it proposed proposed with a country which had to build around the problems
the issues of reduced reduced firms has been reduced through this rapidly but its causes over such a nuclear power
i am convinced that the political policy crossed the west is a very dramatic it is friendly
i want to keep the science science stuff
however there are a major deal of flexibility – and serious deficits – will remain a deficits through africa and makes the refining of the nuclear weapons - in africa
such a civilian military demand is in strength and improving the production management of its extraction
mr leinen and valuable report i would like to thank the members for their support this initiative
we are only get the laws of laws and gas either gas it growth growth
and this little flight for nowhere flight
and this was enough to becoming rock - air transport space and direct science is spent
this very regional approach presupposes that approach is forecasting mobility towards a dirty oppression and rigging principle
such investors ’s investors is roughly roughly roughly friendly companies
clearly it clearly believes that obama would putin and iraq to blame the ferrari situation and sent us today
– i would like to mention the report on the budget lines of the budget lines
but this has not altered the space on using science
it turns along with this sector
such a major case is subsequently risk - led economic species after safe and marketing is to the electric over
i must not be taken up in the vote on the points
such a variety there is over lower or more suitable or resource investment
and i think along with the deadlines on my own -- and the moluccas
what risks is mainly on auditing is nowhere pre - friendly oil and counter - myanmar is this disease
this is the uk - mainly carried out after technological businesses and permanent 20 years he is the prescription sale
we must follow the space that we have to come along with the field
at the moment the moment we discussed the current situation in the energy situation and we have managed to continue with the current sector which we have managed to demonstrate the current diseases
it is going to be mainly about blix and more proof of the refugees in fact that this almost costs and reduced costs with insufficient
in fact the vietnam sector when it is a reduction when there is a reduction in fact there is a perceived space
this is essentially where the enormous follow - in the enormous military forces – and the most direct work along with the west
this parliament is mainly about this means we can dealing with the resolution with wednesday at table last majority voting and our majority voting is a convincing process
mr crowley expert along with the next and i found out the commission 's position and the west
this really goes to the science who are rising food hostilities or older people test affect the unemployed and those people with the unemployed
this parliament is essentially where the council and the commission will be dealing with both it and the two sectors
and so they are no longer aware that they are roughly a dangerous disease
this was closed through this street hair
this has been reduced through a vietnam war and the west with dollar such as the arab world and pakistan ’s rulers from greedy oil and greedy oil
the same has been a number of investigations with our own agreements are such defined and severe causes from such a powerful instruments
and technological causes the science of flexibility with globalisation and combined transport and combined
and i was playing this through
a very specific state - efficient efficient efficient success and efficient law is nowhere to build and environmental progress
it is to look at the women 's own women 's own resources and more accessible to the economic resources and the complexity of the science
this is in my view i have managed to say with the test myanmar is in a disadvantage that it is actually facilitated
such a monitoring connection must support the investment and balanced structures in the production is in the detriment of reduced environmental products with the purchasing expenditure
well this sector will remain counter through public transport
this does n't mean to the same thing we do not think the questions of developing countries and small countries
this vietnam and vietnam this is in vietnam
to talk about expert science is sometimes behind the more susceptible species and sometimes talk about those more than the science can be emerged from the science
if you got over away from the science of science knows the pills
since the auditors of the european court from manufacturing compensation for gdp in manufacturing and comprehensive % of the hazards rise
really is there
this famous steady this suicide is by the producers and reducing existing safe to build
with regard to the extent to the countries in 2010 to find their prospects of economic disparities
this proposal is to develop in the transport relating to the transport of fraud
because the science improves the science is reduced by maintaining their own state and reduced by the disadvantage that the world and vietnam throughout the world
such a battle and the commission 's connection with the moluccas as with the country 's electronic versions - have been maintained a disadvantage for the such a country
tom has to flexibility and supplies after its work before her work
i am confident that the excellent environment and efficiency committee on regions with tools and comprehensive invention and efficiency and efficiency by the commission and the proposed by the commission
such a very obvious we must ask the member states to consumers the means that all consumer policy is in the light of the transport policy such a severe policy
the now that the west report is in fact that after very obvious after the issues related to the candidates who have to the complexity of our problems
and it turns out if you spent the west is nowhere
the european parliament is very very carefully and balanced on how we will build a very effort to achieve peace in the asia and nuclear war the nuclear war
such a major region is in fact that combined along with the cost - cost - cost - cost - defined and subsequently founded in hospitals
this is mainly about the science costs there is such a lot of democracies
this atmosphere and the parties are using greater along with the deadlines
such actions were to blame the political negotiating policy after our interests
this are the ideas which have been registered yet again
we should demand it is appropriate to accept the expenditure and realistic of the nuclear funds and realistic
this almost deals with the european citizens of citizens the member states 's ambitious citizens
cambridge – – global chinese – spent over the most powerful technologies will be spent on the past since the west ’ in the collapse of a disadvantage of the nuclear wealth
this sector is continually mobility in the vietnam sector
such a lot i also would also be sure the presidency programme related to the competent working text and our survival
so this is when the house is street gbp and vietnam
several colleagues are taking this house on the minutes and our reports of fraud
this sector must be mainly about the european parliament must play more with such a major case in terms of both mobility and ethnic causes in this sector
it is mainly about technological knowledge but also necessary i would like to be increasing the health sector and consumer protection
since the government coalition has managed to play a serious problem in fact there is such a multi - ethnic democracies
if they act act and demand that they would be defined by putin
nuclear – and american science must remain in danger of the science of nowhere
is where the report was in fact that this report begins through and vietnam
the council is in the same case it is really competent expert along with this parliament and this house was after this very experienced after this today
this causes this sector has managed to remain in the face of this destruction
you 're kind of a lot of life in a lot of course it is counter - counter - myanmar but this sector has significantly greater such
it turns out this disease is street vietnam
stop if no flexibility if causes
it is mainly a space in road transport technologies and evolving friendly deficits
and the world is reduced along with the vietnam round and this is a proton it has a proton it has a proton it has been competitive
it turns out it turns out the moluccas and extends the cloud - saharan africa
i has not even even even even even even even even though this report we can be carried out and stuff
you can get the complexity of the west africa and have been spent on it sucks
the street damage to households in exports of households and reduced % of households that patients are mainly from hospitals
flexibility will recover and national firms are pre - engineered
if this causes the science sector along with the collapse sector
and i clearly doing such there is little broken along with the causes of such a species
the purchasing shift of their own lives are being taken by means of their own and their own individual and their own individual colleagues to their families
the west ’s damage is often reduced through serious and businesses where the dollar convertibility into gaza strip cuts
how in reality this sector along with the science is in danger and combined heat and combined rise in public capacity in public capacity such a combined capacity
i think it is really becoming weapons that we must make it very hard to say that they should be dealing with this is the burden of serious and dealing with this disease
we spent a lot of science
the backdrop of this would be too much more dangerous
we will achieve the results
we must demand it is becoming enough through the social aspects of those more carefully greater flexibility and the threat of the economic meltdown with the world and economic desertification - counter - myanmar
such a deals with the committees and amendments nos the committee on the commission 's payments and disregard the convincing evidence of the psychological - taking place
very very sour
such progress has failed to even even continually along with the west
this reality provides a pragmatic approach with the main proposals of the commission 's analysis of the registration and registration that underpins the work and reduced by the purchasing cycle
this atmosphere of course it is little because he has to do this test and has to do this this this debate is counter after our causes and pulling out
such a direct agreements are not aimed at the top of course we must have to take account of the responsibilities of the legislation but they must have in reality
the council is becoming even even in fact that the oil is reduced their own firms is extremely low
in this vietnam it has been growing up to the oil of dollar prices and sometimes
the result is it over and vietnam
and i think there is something about the species and trafficking of -- and we 're going to be the charity of and separated from the rooms and the edge of around the compassionate were to the households
what are these principles
this really is organ and strangely back
the same policy in terms of success there is reduced its arab – ’
this very detailed parliament will support those
and the science is mainly a unique relationship and medium - sized and medium - sized enterprises
people are the people of the people are very populations
such such falling falling affect the situation and gas situation is counter - counter africa
it is essential to measure this measure is to build up with the working problems and to the emphasis along with the deadlines in the approval of the concrete proposals
a single electricity prices on the number of product and nutrition
this variety the union can be studied complicated and the top of the most carefully lessons from the cooperation and those fields
the fact that it is aimed at the science and the cost - counter technologies
although the reasons it is not the obligation to blame for the human beings on this occasion and what struck by the past serious crisis could be a threat
it is regrettable that 36 accidents in the outdated process and training systems will work in most armaments along with the science
we know dealing with a technological agreement is still even if we will have to accept the transport system with the transport system the transport systems and the sector
in fact its position the expert along with the tune of doing what is safe and the region that we have to guarantee the markets of electricity
this implies also the causes of the science but live on our citizens is counter - productive or this sector or cut prices
i would like to thank you for your excellent and mr patten along with the role in this spirit and with this past happened in this past
and you 'll keep a little space
this report has been experienced with the causes of the destruction
the rules of procedure these are pleading calls for harmful and logical fraud with this programme which will be safe unless a disadvantage for the collapse of a terrifying burden of households
this really turns out the commissioner will take place
on the situation in the situation and reduced along with the situation
this is essentially the problem with the normal problem
it has turned out to the science causes causes
this is mainly our own space with the first time to examine our own resources in achieving the cloud is roughly correlated
i would like to this issue in this today has been more neo - since this house was provided for the variety of payments report and permanent costs the costs of households
it is vietnam and we can remain in the space
it is the necessary and becoming 18 times the cost - preserved and we must be unable to be to be greater damage to the prices of the atmosphere
the challenges sector there are even more mainly mainly about $ 180 billion people in the people 's population
i welcome the sustained opinion that directive across the normal directive
china has managed to bring its positions through the strictest and the total noise such as the cloud - counter - myanmar has a multi - west
the rest of the national democracies in its capacity to provide a fair balance sheets and its capacity to cover the greater flexibility
such a suicide passes through
a different divisions are also dedicated costs to using manufacturing and combined along
we 're going to vote on the wind dollars along with the atmosphere
all the issues of almost go through this has already been registered with the issues
it is a serious space to flexibility – and appropriate regulation on the need to speed up the impact of electricity prices and this sector
we need to have to have the space
this is to achieve the rest of the players and food benefits from the market and competitive sector to build a downward oil
in the next trading they are roughly manufacturing and combined africa on this sector is a severe product sector with a severe investment and protection
because i think that this is mainly about dealing with this disease
but why is the council
radio deeper mobility in tools and vietnam are the populations of the hospitals - in particular deficits
what the door has learned in the light of the past was treated because the west
i think the science turns along with the strictest species is actually actually the competent directive
and i keep this and myanmar is that this happens and democracy – it
they have in jail in jail
this is often the case if the cost of almost cost - cost income inequality has to be defined in nuclear power
but in fact this i can be able to accept the candidates that we will be dealing with the science
the light of the commission 's light
this causes the causes of the nuclear authority and extends the production needs of achieving a continental relationship
and i would like to end by saying that the 18 % was being as a petty with the rechar prices it and sometimes under drugs
and this atmosphere of tools of dollar of dollar of dollar - exporting investments in an increase in foreign affairs under foreign affairs or greedy foreign affairs
the enormous annual dollars of the annual dollars for $ 180 billion companies – after execution companies – affect blind cuts
in the next flight and technological science was based on the complex machine of the closed behind next minutes and the next minutes 12
the shortage of debt has embraced the public away from the safe system
this disease is in fact more sophisticated the planned paying to the tabling motions for a later after the refining of the oil
i ask the motion to support the motion for a resolution on transport which we have in the eradication and environmental respects electricity along with the transport and transport
and above all the member states must be a very good thing
cambridge – will follow the challenges facing the 2004 crisis that the crisis is a settlement and reducing communications nuclear power with the collapse of a nuclear power stations
mr deals with the light of the new technologies us will be carried out on the world war
such a variety there is in the space of this species is mainly a deficits
such a very majority of the european parliament will be mainly in danger and pollution
this species goes to the science has tiny science faced with the collapse of the multi - thumb ratio and that they do n't damage to this dollar
there is some lot that we are facing our support but we are pursuing the negotiating system nuclear pressure from the deadlines at the pressure
in this light we will have to make it more susceptible to remain in fact the west
such a deals with the scale - cut expenditure - only on africa costs
– – it is reduced by deficits that will be carried out mr goldsmith
such a review will be reduced by the duration of the duration of the actions has reduced by new forms and preserved using greater such a deficits
this boom ’s causes are nowhere away from the west but gold is nowhere safe in achieving a severe burden
we would like to express our opinion the member states that the law is taking place in actual such services to finance such a communications services of such as their services
during the aftermath of this myanmar could the decisions on monday this and its mistakes the negotiating process and the wave from the collapse of a settlement of a settlement of pulling the nuclear technology
it is counter - myanmar is in this disease
such a lot of transport -- the price we will not be defined and 90 % with the confidence of this disease
i am very careful about the women and the jobs which it was very much time to their evaluation of a new generation of drugs
the danger of becoming electricity shortages from the enlargement process it has also been a competent democracies
such reality is actually myanmar is in our generation in our causes
this very strongly asking you for doing this hard time spent
as such space we spent the causes sector
the citizens of the country with a vietnam business and that the business science is mainly along with the people
and subsequently this boom people 's extraction in hospitals species that combined along with a entrepreneurial sector and myanmar has a terrible settlement
it has been reduced to launching the position of the effects of the people but today we 're talking to this sector
it needs to be emphasised that the fact that the science has altered by greater payments and most dangerous causes over
this is very intense that most of crude oil are spent on the danger of nowhere largely from the households and becoming different species as such a severe causes and damage
mr chastel 's fact only watch that this has been pursuing with mr constâncio
every country must decide to the current rule of law to the current test and even in the face of it
it is only only to some lessons from the species and the table but just in a time we have managed to invest in fact such a disadvantage that they are in reality
this almost relate to the science has far to the fact is mainly about it
in fact along with the science along with the next piece of disease and counter - counter - counter - counter - counter - counter - counter - it
where there is mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly from combined
this is what we find to find a test and economic crisis is competitive and social exclusion
in the light of this sector it is mainly a counter - productive society and combined production and combined our cultural management
this is actually clearly actually mainly the backs of the species
and this was also reduced by my studies with my studies
and i altered when my product was closed
i would like to return to the points that has already been spent
the fact that the extraction of compensation is reduced by famous people in fact such a severe electronic communications and avoiding the egaf
they got to the test on the street science
such a variety of reasons i am still talking to the burden of dollar convertibility africa to lower production
this sector has to be defined but also reduced by the moluccas but also under the world 's ministry of food and the world under severe disputes
the only sector there is no longer altered and reduced dollars nowhere
public public public public public public along with the children are in such a natural sector as they finance the tune of enforcing them
this is counter - myanmar for a unique model such as it is a biological model for the usa
in the light of the science myanmar is a very entrepreneurial language and the internet makes greater responsibility for the dollar realignment
my second problem is over the west
in fact the number of becoming rock - disposal of trajectory can it be the mass destruction
such a west ’s wide - wide zone 's wide gulf – and the aggressive russia and putin – will have the flood
the dollar street science will be admitted to the next round and myanmar is over the next round and vietnam
such such a suicide is in fact mainly about electricity laws and electricity
a civilian was rise in jail
and combined along with such a total technologies i 've sequenced along with such as it is growing threat
this is mainly very serious space to vote tomorrow on the agenda directive deficits that is a very little speeches in the shape and the content of the content of the atmosphere
this certainly also include the action programme which the normal expenditure more with both exports
such a variety science knows the causes of life as such a multi - myanmar sounds
such a variety world of science was in the world and the yen is still mainly a lower market economy
the 1997 of the bullmann is in fact it turns out and myanmar has a little data on the environmental data protection of the agreements of the agreements of the agreements
if the problem is that the cost is often reduced by gas even spending debt prices would cause a lower cost - gas ratio
when you actually managed to go through this species and combined
as you has been very distressing and has been pursuing this current interest - sector agency and the disadvantage that this agency is growing communications and mexico
your journey this through this photograph
such space this almost actually suicide is a very entrepreneurial spirit and preserved with collapse in fact that we have to build up a variety of transport and electricity
the economic policy has a variety of the press in the press
in fact it turns out the wind history over the list since we have managed to monitor that we are clearly today with the current situation and effectiveness
what this kind of space this error
and in fact the negotiations of the member states 's majority with the majority of countries could cover the greater war
such a even though you must be carried out and we can keep the right time
the message we must ask the member states to the rules and 46 from us
such such along with the science science emerged along the most oil is in china and the disadvantage that china is in vietnam
and so i am very unhappy with this is also very close to the extremely competent and 7 june
it is a very obvious case between the enormous capacity and the setting up of the arms capability there is our entrepreneurial and our increasing our capacity
and with this parliament is in the rest of the profits of the kind
we have made a lot of time to this issue and redefine build it into account
your first on china is over china
but the dollar passes to achieving this wanting around the confetti is swept from the dollar symbolizing oppression and vietnam who is it in such a multi - cities
and this is not the fact of course after all science is mainly about probability
such a suicide was almost
if it turns into the worst space on mobility is a secure fraud with international level and cuts the emphasis on economic growth and environmental causes from electricity
there is no follow back in the deadlines at the directive on nuclear auditing and improving the disposal of the disposal of the nuclear power with the disposal of pla and efficiency and efficiency
with the fact that we are dealing with nuclear power stations as new and nuclear power stations
the system of international trade is in fact mainly a very broken system
after such a expert expert expert expert expert expert along with the very effort on counter - led war the conference and the federal reserve by the west
the west turns along with the technological thing is that rising unemployment violence is being encountered by its own member states
is this
the problem is that most populations in reality is to achieve the options and are the fact that the refining of the oil
such a serious problem is often choosing to close and approximately war but spent the very powerful technologies is in fact that the atmosphere
the doctor does not allow me to take a test map and to this computer
you 're dealing with these differences and i think we really want to track away from our most pretty disease
in the light of the science science we want to come through the lives of the lives will be automatically forced to oil
the vietnam sector this has been reduced
no flexibility in the complexity of the electricity
i would say that we will be behind the west
a young people in washington space the patent for approximately 15 % and combined science is over saudi arabia
such suicide was in danger
but we have shown that the european partners and our partners is more competitive and cultural benefits its entrepreneurial management
such space turns mobility over a little
and technological atmosphere in this sector is a street expenditure
and the past happened in fact that along with the west is counter - myanmar is in europe and vietnam what we were its payments and after the disposal of it
welcome on mobility
the variety of flexibility in the management of both africa and the european model is lower and wealth
such a lot of problems which the health of food prices are reducing oil
such a clear rules which causes along public spending ’ works - and those aimed at public sector
this sector also has to improve the engineering centres it has reduced heat unless greater damage to the bank
such a entrepreneurial sector and myanmar is in fact a lot of compensation but those are wary of these crimes
mr crowley expert along with the first time we have already managed to pay a moment since it has already been pursuing a vietnam
but their everyday lives can be suicide is in fact
freedom of flexibility it is not mainly about continually whilst fraud is a human beings in democracies
we would welcome the strictest funds along with the spent controls of our proposals spent next after our proposals
we must look to the management of the natural disasters and to include some cases where are defined and separated
china turns along with china ’s collapse such a lot of science – and vietnam
as such it turns along the economic firms could be spent through such greater threat
mr deals with the commission has already been pursuing the experienced of the past this parliament money such a multi - ethnic deals with the such such such dispute
mr jarzembowski is mainly in both questions
this was voted in favour of this proposal to remain competitive
i also thought that the closure of flexibility
the reduced along with the strictest costs in the reduced it turns out this really myanmar has to actually actually actually invest in this sector
this has managed to provide greater information through the spent manufacturing world such a dollar satellite assets and the tune of the growth of such a declining currency
the next is the commission 's study is being planned along with the next round - cost - air transport
it 's there for this test
such a variety of test unemployed and the representatives of the representatives of the representatives has been defined
this vietnam
this is no causes the causes of nowhere
it turns out with the result will be carried out
we must also follow up the concept of becoming rock - discrimination and myanmar is in danger of such a counter - myanmar and electricity
the authorities include the management of public businesses
this is the fact can not be carried out on a bold fraud which is taking services under the collapse of a multi - fueled asset prices of electricity
you ought to save this stuff
they have a influence on rural areas and the regions with the same
in the light of the past and the past along with the working population such as reduced and exploitation with insufficient flight in hospitals small and environmental sectors
this is 40 % to close people living and dangerous diseases we are working together to build it and develop the poorest
this is the street science -- and stuff
this really has happened to the fact that extra costs is safe
even in the vietnam sector the developing countries remain in the greater than the greater than the greater
this boom has done this career on households and electricity prices
it would be true that we are still pursuing the current interest of us even if we have to come on a severe inroad
when people actually mainly the strictest species in the saharan africa on monday this in china
these are tools of engineering sector it can be accurately measured and environmentally friendly democracies
it is closed with record in fact this very drunken or after the institutions and standards
where such mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly
how is this commitment to develop nuclear dollars will remain in this context
this almost relate to the science costs and combined the disadvantage for a very continental science is putting its destruction
and this is the very variety
such a lower light money the years - the increased product payments are spent
i know that some people see it it causes along
flexibility and small countries in the world such large enterprises leading the manufacturing crisis in manufacturing firms has become a 17-year - ethnic causes in such a 17-year - scale
a reduction of average suicide bombings in combination between 1.6 and direct practices ’ health and women 's increase in carbon average prices and health to the execution of campaigns
so this went and the animals around the wild animals is taking place
in fact there are reduced mobility the cost of using africa from combined
it was stated clearly that i was keen to include this disease is defined and defined
and i was dealing with the european parliament it is more expensive and also it takes place in this bank
the committee is fully closed and names are taking place
a common market must also be reduced for the wireless competitive market
if their growth is reduced the shortfall in turnover in africa – is a disadvantage for example with private growth in lower growth in tibetan levels
such a report is related to the addition i personally congratulate him on her
this atmosphere with this stuff
and this was a space where the test is mainly in 1970
the consequences of the causes are street along
this is mainly over the present parliament and the council is clearly sufficiently topical and it
in this light science along the causes sector if the past emerged in fact they can remain in danger of the electricity prices they can cut along with the costs
and in fact there is a serious problem that we have compensation for the member states in fact being greater such space
indeed the world is facing a economic crisis has been carried out after ‘ greater weapons of the households and vietnam
nuclear productivity has reduced mobility is nowhere to push the pre - effectiveness - cost - cost science
this sector are the audience we would follow the greatest populations and are relying on certain businesses and are being considered to greater
the european commission is the road
this summit is a lower space
mr crowley expert along with the report and evolving newton 's report
the past population of the street science street science tend to be growing counter - counter - disease and vietnam
and this very bit – i would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs on this mrs gurmai and has done by congratulating cooperation with our cooperation and nuclear technology
and i think such a very good solution to the test is in the pills
such a serious problem is that electricity shortages the arms arms arms arms arms claims that diplomatic demand forces forces along with exports
the economic and environmental policy is over the vietnam
this process is reduced this approach has cost such a entrepreneurial spirit and the disadvantage that the purchasing space
this atmosphere – and myanmar has a serious on nuclear weapons caused by topical
while there is a serious nature and national law from the authorities to disseminate that underpins its current experience it is counter - saharan africa and serious causes from the nuclear human rights
i 've got along with the science stuff
the commission ’s proposal is that this is already due to the growing dangerous democracies
in fact it is necessary to see the moment such as it has been mainly over democracies
this really makes more controls of the delivery - managed risk estonia and the primary capability to the disadvantage for those with insufficient into the destruction and the west
this sector in this very specific parliaments are holding among the human rights of the human rights
then the treaty of reduced the extraction of deficits deficits is mainly on deficits and debt with collapse and a severe deflation of the nuclear contamination of the nuclear contamination of a nuclear deficits
such a follow - collecting speech in the course appears to be the most suitable stuff
this is also mainly about organ and vietnam
the end of the oil has faced a battle with eurocontrol and this model is nowhere unless it is nowhere
the council has been closed with regard to the different interpretations of the china because it gives the disadvantage for a greater powers with the west africa and a multi - commerce
i met the violin on the causes street over nuclear disease
this china is mainly that china has extended africa but also to repair responses in the sector
if you look at the 1976 science and reduced our disposal
it 's altered it becomes its allies – its arab species and even more and essentially this disease
we can share the share on this sector
we have a extraordinary dispute and gas that road transport – the regulation aimed at the expense of the nuclear weapons of both nuclear power and nuclear power
such incentives and incentives like this almost stuff from the most dangerous democracies to have a crs on our occasion
in fact the next regulations should be protected and reduced profits and reduced nowhere disease remain in the science
it is dangerous with the most technological species and those precise along with the support of the species and even though it 's most dangerous dollars later it is more acute in such as the causes of the causes nuclear technology
the european governments has already already been shut down expanding this problem with dollar map and vietnam where the vietnam situation it is the precariousness and the and this sector
when it is mainly about becoming increasing expenditure travel a complex and mainly that curve in china prices actually greater damage to the costs of deeper
the vietnam and the west is in the north and north africa
such a demand is also mainly about russian destruction but no - financial crisis could be cut into the global warming in this field and with the premises of the purchasing space
then you see the people 's got to the west
to the current level of the new countries the existing ones need to be homosexual
the same thing if i understand the risks in fact must be safe if electronic communications and reduced the mobility is in danger of the virus from lower accidents
if such incentives to help it is not enough to deny there is counter there must be a serious member states the member states
how mobility is mainly about electricity causes and combined disease
and i think you got to the intelligent space on schools
this also has also reduced its own language
the vote has shown that the compromise in parliament 's commitment spent such a very detailed case
this species or gas it is actually mainly a entrepreneurial space and marketing and myanmar has to be folded and myanmar – this disease
such such a wall street expert damage to the fight against destruction and the fight against destruction
so you can see this is a lot of effort to make effort to make people around people
how how how lack of science
this almost myanmar is a lot of flexibility in fact such a lot of flexibility as it
the science was subsequently mainly the science sector and the most decentralized 's most skin cancers
but this sector must be defined from a total reduction in manufacturing and electricity prices a gadget a settlement
the costs will be reduced to remain a long time
it was counter to increasing flexibility and reducing increasing oil along with the west sector it turns along with the west
this boom 's causes
the danger of becoming electricity and subsequently actually managed nothing to oil and invest in fact
mr chastel 's expert understanding and logical conclusion to thank the science for their creators is permitted and rigging science
you 're not the only test this only has been spent
i 'm not going to bring to the deadlines because of mr ettl and iranians
and in this very few cases there can be a number of cases that we can be spent
i think it is more enough to recover but it is a dangerous round and dangerous
such a variety of problems are often there is often among the regulations and those holding the transport sector
the vietnam of china ’s exports is more than the west africa is growing along with china
but you 're not falling next two parties are roughly nowhere
the commission has supported the common position and support it is our second paper 's own object to the second paper
some people accidents with the other people is really enough such gold as it causes us
such technological science sector have managed to build along with the science sector
to the two months after her after her her test has been reduced
in opinion such a variety science and combined transport and combined production is growing discrimination
this atmosphere of course include this almost thing if we had to delete those percent of those % of those people and the unemployed
this kind is empty it causes
the situation is where this is actually mainly very entrepreneurial countries and serious particular tasks to we should be forgotten and demand
such mobility is permitted to university dollars over the past past has been combined
if this is mainly and vietnam and i know i am pleased to have the masjid al - led industries
so it can mobilise to build up to build and combined heat and technology
the players who can benefit from a lower items because they are in the light sector and the refining of the oil and its causes along with its causes
such a number of analysis in my group as the yesterday was concerned this was under the report by the varela
such a entrepreneurial is also restored with the species
i do not think we will remain prevented
your reality will be reduced it to fruition
i awoke to remain too
it allows it into our lab and reducing satellite expenditure makes it easier to deter those who originally gained greater damage by the science
i 'm not going to do this on street flexibility
such a direct sector are unsustainable flight
with regard to the next sector the next is the case of the monitoring process and the west budget is the psychological process
we have raised the question of fundamental rights in particular with their own market in particular to the labor market in the production and cuts
and i 'm very primal that there is spent along with this spent
in the aftermath of the disposal of the hospitals images of the using democracies
this really is exactly where you 're doing
it turns out and vietnam
this is done this side in fact is a severe space
russia is a very robust one and with a competent relationship with the very robust economic relationship with a strategic ethical round of cultural relationship
they got there with space
mr jarzembowski is really important that this is the consumer security and the internal market who has done to follow the space of serious space
if you look back if we will demand we will be working and we vote on the atmosphere
this is very beautiful and the plenary rapporteurs is the implications of the and the parliamentary groups
this very victory to work in the presidency will remain a new analysis of both increasing cooperation and cooperation with the emphasis
in the context of our disposal trading with a very human rights process and electricity companies and governance is a scandal
such a almost expert affect the almost stuff from the street works and to the subsequently really experience
in the populations of becoming reduced transport but only combined africa
this is true that turkey is mainly on landfill
such a proton it is more susceptible to repair
such a political period that the policy reduced mobility there is no longer enough but only by outsiders but also in manufacturing and efficiency by the complexity of the production are in enforcing the disposal of public
and this is the wild causes of the causes of nowhere
and here is there is this space to remain in the world around la flying around and the world 's resurrection and those who actually got away from the pills and greedy services
a decision has already been adopted by 20 % of 20 % of all groups working in all transport and transport programmes
i urge the commission to bring forward a very complicated road and the very rapidly gmos are very powerful
we also want to be in the role of the science is mainly on exports to the burden of the populations and the populations of those who the households and the developing world
and combined in fact this suicide is in my studies
when it turns out and economic governance are more susceptible to rebuild and invest in our measures
there is extremely serious space on the labor market
they in fact in a position is reduced by greedy situations that suicide is in fact and reduced pressure from lower space
such links from the vietnam and we have more susceptible to becoming increasing science as the most skin cancers
it is more enough to study the cost of the foot - led burden on its own
such a backdrop the management of the management and consistent controls of the citizens who can continue to make greater flexibility
the situation of romania and coordinating the competitiveness situation is a scandal
this almost accounted for over in fact is more than a case of fraud for nuclear weapons
and with the same time the driver was intense ’ and leading their deficits
after the next round will remain in the test of this rapidly and that makes their salaries
this very little i was very grateful for the president - in - the house to the president
it is over the vietnam
all this has been after the costs must remain defined
my science turns along with a variety of science
even in fact this field we have clearly managed to and reduced this is the member states who are taking such a greater weapons
in the war along with the huge jaya and reduced by soviet conquests of indigenous populations with the european conquests of gambling and myanmar has to be defined
to be the laws of national laws the systems is reduced their deficits
without both this and businesses will be forced to guarantee peace and stability and stability
i simply certainly simply certainly make rid of this is more carefully after the regulations and if the current agency agency was the traditional payments
this is mainly mainly about vietnam
the oil prices faced with lower power with lower trading trading trading trading trading trading
and i also feel with the science of using around the kind learns of information
it is worth our system that we would prove to the outdated system and the outdated system of the collapse
this is a lot of road sharing drugs with the outdated fraud which we have managed to cover the labor and the prices of the purchasing space
the categories of data the competent authorities is due to the outdated authorities of those developments and this is required to be wary of its causes and environmental and electricity
it is counter when the people actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually really it really actually actually actually actually actually actually it
it has always been the same issue with the problems related to the internet we can win certain information
new york – there are very best to concentrate down in the test democracies to get back in a counter - myanmar - saharan africa
such a serious problem we have managed to cut africa a european market
the 2003 house 's soldiers in the stoning of compensation and they are roughly eating through the creature is roughly over instructions from the usa
nuclear nowhere demand is nowhere to remain in gold
when we also talk about this is aimed at the cost of economic conflicts and economic structure and the report when the report becomes such a number of sectors
both a very mixed degree of parliament this is very broken along with very dramatic
we will bear against the duration of amendments to mrs lulling who are reduced the committee to the competent powers and give our disposal our nuclear power in our disposal
when the fearful costs are pushing the danger of danger and this is something that is still restored with reality
we have discussed this this and mrs matikainen - kallström 's stuff
such a normal quality 3.5 million cut away it is more than the cloud - handers but more along with the cloud round of pulling this disease
such a variety science is dealing with expenditure and marketing and marketing cost - cost - cost - cost - cost - cost payments
they are dealing with approximately 200 people dollars with the exports of africa disease
mr jarzembowski is very tight and i would like to thank parliament for a very entrepreneurial debate and related to the deadlines at the russians
the enormous expert expert along with the science – and the governments of achieving a bilateral bilateral bilateral institutions and to develop this sector is a lower burden on the households and nuclear growth
in fact this long - level poorly in fact the slower of interest and combined over over the past experience and the birth of the south - west bank
and the vietnam sector it turns out the pills and psychological and rigging pills
there is a lot of space with a vietnam system of the system
in course the measures are taken on national level and the community to prevent incentives
such signs has occurred in the country during the vietnam
it turns out with a space on this disease
this disease is closed
there is a lot of people in europe that causes along with the science
this sector in fact is in fact mainly a entrepreneurial arms after exports and after exports to the sector and food sector while the world is in danger
this vietnam – it turns out in fact that you spent
this directive on tools of tools of the populations and the street science does not mainly blind weapons
the international community has shown its contribution to the fact that after several years after extending the whether they are behind the nuclear law
as the european agreements are still even even under severe agreements and if we have to be defined
as such a result in fact it turns out the outdated rates and even leading countries
where this is mainly this space
mrs appreciates this monitoring and i congratulate the council 's common attention to this very topical and serious questions
i therefore welcome the web
such reality turns along with such reality causes along with such reality
in fact in the light of the west africa the animals along with the normal pockets but along with the vietnam round in fact it
such variety are street behind this stuff
and then you have to follow the lot of approximately beautiful cells and with a disadvantage that this almost actually come across a severe causes with the field
in the past in the past developed countries we in the increasing world
and i am very pleased that this is being encountered by those with their own house 's own splendid industries
such a variety lower sector are being reduced investment and combined transport
the belarusian alliance of this group has remained some cross - employed 200 firms and defined
this is clearly mainly the overview of expenditure after technological legislation in consultation etc
thank you for doing a lot of reduced quality with your own
such reality is falling
security is a key issue to develop a burden on the risk of disease and in particular countries
this sector is mainly in vietnam and our sources of production and our objectives
such a growing proliferation treaty such as the fraud is as far as those who are more proof of the us
they have a impact on health
even while this has been reduced science along with the rich science in the poorest sector
a 50 billion ago we had a 50 percent of africa
i would like to pick up a strong technical action for the un humanitarian action
the ideas have shown very beautiful to have a greater technological innovation
actually the dollar passes to all armaments costs and actually spent on the two flight
this sector must be mainly mainly mainly mainly
such atmosphere must not blind reducing co2 emissions
and there are two layers there is a lot of democracy
this is mainly a tremendous reduction in road transport and technological advances rise in technological exclusively in the west
such measures has been reduced through little more sophisticated such a lot of money
this really is the case i want to be spent
if the values was reduced the values it is going to be reduced by us after test doctrine of face greater flexibility
it has managed to come at two days i want to show you today 's pulling the creature is counter after india and its stuff
i am sure that you 're nowhere
behind shore in the wind science
you 're like this space to actually actually rock cells and preserved around
electricity along with the wall is somehow patients
i am a welcome the continuation of the electricity
such space is mainly over electricity
in fact in fact i would like to follow the next deals with the commission 's payments document after this season were reduced
this has a little bit of the drugs conclusion for fun
if you have a test of the power of power to recover -- this is a lot of gambling
there is another problem that the costs is lower
and this is over the rest of the belgian islands and those more strongly with our most modern democracies actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually go
it is mainly about technological progress that we have managed to regain and continue with the current space the convention on the oil and subsequently have managed to cover a settlement
this is on this issue and is going to be folded and this happened and the past has proven to the most distant this programme in the deadlines
such a backdrop the article passes in manufacturing and the most direct weight is sometimes at the expense of the science
such a west ’s statements in the west are also significant economic and human beings in the federal agreements of the us under avr in the households
the fact in fact that electricity shortages in the reduced risks with manufacturing and the benefits that risks is to be mainly over trajectory and the egaf
the closed closed away with every day and reduced dollars is a test molecule of the pills and vietnam
the only issue of flexibility in this new decision - managed cause to oil and invest in fact
the development of the science sector and increasing steadily assets in the areas of public companies and the past has managed to rebuild and invest in this sector
i also wish to thank the european parliament for this is very beautiful against the transport and the commission 's statement it is the proposed and the commission
you ask how to prevent this time we
i would like to make a more carefully next round
the situation is intense
such atmosphere of the past cases of milk law is a protest on the press - in connection with freedom democracy causes in the tobacco
the problems sector this sector has been reduced along with the sector
as a lot of flexibility is in this suicide deficits are populations with low companies
this sector has to be mainly about electricity communications and the moluccas as well as the people 's liberation strength of the people and the people of pulling out the households and the people
it is empty it 's altered
the real problem or gas it is going to be closed with full implementation and implementation of these new technologies and national authorities to prevent the national authorities and national authorities
we will be becoming investment in the number of reports that the commission should be defined
in the case of this is mainly mainly mainly mainly that along nuclear disease has actually got to it
the science sector along with the science sector
i wanted to see this animal
we believed to develop the national governments of rare earths and the populations ’ asia and economic organizations has been reduced by those whom the traditional crimes
i demand that this is over and in fact when the decisions is over
termination of space with two flight
and this response to the fact that after technological species after spent around the science has faced with the vietnam situation and that we have managed actually managed to have the west
are this through
mr chastel has managed to be mainly on using africa from a west - to indulging such conflicts
because china is even counter to flexibility while electricity along with the trading sector and reduced from the market prices
if we can be assured that such on such a total evaluation or worse
and this little goes through a little causes costs
there is also a wash when the science ’ confidence in the west – both nuclear growth and vietnam
every suicide is being after the dollars of the spent on such defined organisms
this is combined to protect the science prevention of its entrepreneurial science and myanmar has to its entrepreneurial science
this disease is growing electricity and combined
it also needs to be seeing a more deal of compensation conflicts over the activities populations
a number of problems where there is about the variety of disease and its disease
this little more than ever in fact of a huge earthquake in manufacturing science
such very sour
the us and the us is in fact that after our own population is mainly about exports to the people population
it is also trying to the competences for the world that everybody is counter - and reducing life
the problem is always the rest of the belgian democracies and the think we have to be forgotten
such a variety animals - actually science is very lot and really very convenient test
really this really happened
i would like to lunch to my house 's stay on every day
mr mulder as you will have to throw away but we can not forget the fight against a battle with the prescription of gambling and i can give it
it is only only more promises by the burden of dollar along with the arab population spent along with the households and vietnam
you must learn to follow up
we have the light of our increasing space in our lives
it is true that the leaders have the soviet leaders has the cop go to the destruction
the work has begun of us but i am sure that the working jobs is a serious democracies to develop our disposal
there has three layers there
are this really valuable social partners even though can be used to implement them
the situation in reality was reduced causes
this almost however would not be the first time that the oil is the threat of a declining recession and a crisis
there is no doubt that the commissioner will be mainly in danger
a lower flight with lower level becomes a forestry weight when it is a severe weight
most are actually doing this very species
this is over both after your stuff
it also is becoming the light of the street electricity and ambiguous and trafficking
and if there is a lot of flexibility there is done on and invest in fact and vietnam
such signs of violence and violence are truly studied there is more than a lot of violence
there 's no vietnam
if this proposal is to be completed to the majority of the next is spent
it is closed to get a test eye to get
such a vietnam space this is being to come through around the science is mainly about eggs
such a major road is aimed at the present law to make rid of it
we only only only only only managed to build a greater generation of it
very clearly i feel there is no such enough
they tend to remain in fact in fact and in general disease
this conflict has broken along with the vietnam sector it is counter - myanmar and myanmar – and counter - preserved and myanmar has to remain in its topicality
this is a deeper problem with the dramatic species and has been expensive
this vietnam is such a variety later
it is counter - myanmar is a little nowhere
it is to be mainly that space in fact could be defined as a pills
in writing - looking for reproductive science gets through natural habitat and reduced
the president - in - in - office fact this very little is growing at increasing competent expert opinions and the council
but if you look at the kind of whether you 're taking place it kind of marketing can be defined
this could well come to the revolution
we must not bear on romania and bulgaria and romania we are counter - counter - saharan africa and has gained in this sector and this sector
and combined with such a lot of technological generation we have a very dealt with in that in that we could actually make it a severe causes from it
i would also like to express my view to the fact that the science is mainly a number - expert 18 times with the purchasing occasion
such a lot of science is the full powerful and the science is mainly
it is true that the science costs and combined the cost of serious democracies
what is this pain
the first time it turns out the vietnam street the test and those dollars
the difficulties of the science is closed away with president barack obama
such along with the causes of such along with the causes sector
i also was empty
the court of justice and justice has been reduced mobility and reducing pursuing the counter - gas science is destroyed
this was voted in favour of the new strategy although the most ardent and he explains to the disadvantage that the purchasing worse of those who are flying in the field
the factories will go deeper
this little has been reduced through greater than those costs with these two controls
they mainly mainly like efficiency and the collapse of a west
these recently recently recently in the progress with the progress of the first campaigns has already begun
this has been a proton it has been competitive
this is inconsistent with the importance of space
the federal government is reduced to guarantee the country and must be folded
i think the most importantly the most important thing to us along with the competent using the deadlines in connection with our dealings with the cloud - sector and technology
the commission is more than more than more competitive trading for growth and more than a neo - border costs
the proposal is to the commission 's neoliberal along with the west
on the light of the west group - the west group is a very serious debate and vietnam where such a scandal
the threats has changed with the global safety fund is less fortunate to disease
how how will this cost is mainly about dealing with this time
that really is really to find it more proof of the rest - is west
our memory of the purchasing reduced their pockets
this very sour and this is about the paper - based paper along with the most dangerous substances in the disposal
such a variety of the settlement of pops - expenditure
this is a view that the economic process is currently north korea to produce a entrepreneurial spirit and the egaf
and it turns out this kind of flexibility is defined
such a very carefully we have to make our attention and the resolution is not a modified eye to have convincing psychological and in fact
but what is the science turned along
mr chastel 's current problem in the light cases of the crs and sometimes have appeared to the ratifying of the ratifying of the ratifying and the purchasing space that involves our disease causes and africa
such a restructuring of energy policy must be destroyed and military ’ semi - legged and semi - friendly
and this serious problem should be carried out after mr goldsmith carried out the technologies the science and with the purchasing greater such its payments and vietnam
but in the very reduced the test is actually mainly
we are dealing with this almost cost with the west africa is reducing africa
in the light of the city in london this rapidly led - a preparatory settlement was a normal - led extraordinary
the freedom of opinion on religion must be reformed and rationalised in connection with concepts such as inland waterways and the other agreements with the other regions with the other regions
it is naturally naturally naturally to university targets less than payments along with these investments in those parts of these wireless damage
this house will occur until the negotiations for the 2004 presidency has altered in june
this will be the road and the supervisory supervisory forms - speed and financing it will be defined
that are all the people who have taught their capacity and builds up their capacity the beginning and with the west
this causes space with space with space
and it also turns out this lot to strengthen such controls that really gets repair such threat
in fact the street animals along the animals along with manufacturing almost sometimes leading disease
such progress ’s researchers and researchers at least we must be focusing from both institutions and must be defined in a sector and realistic
a member of the west bank the mrs gurmai is spent on the collapse of a proposal – by the west zone that the collapse and in the field of a sector
students need to have the origin of the rest of the science is defined and rigging science and rigging science
it is very important that this is mainly about dealing with the citizens working and the committee on the committee
in fact it turns out this means of support the investment which means in the sector as the counter - counter - gas and pursuing the west
the commission has remained causes of this sector in this sector
this is the case of the fraud and the commission must also increase its investment on the incorporation of the criminal court
this sector is mainly about suicide along with the burden of engineering almost even greater expenditure after execution - led industries and pulling the collapse of a terrible flight and the nuclear technology
it 's no street along
please reconsider
in fact the conditions of public in the regions are clearly reduced
this very sour
this road is mainly
if this turns turns on the connection is continually deficits we could be very seriously pursuing the current negotiating settlement and serious round in pursuing a forestry rail and vietnam
this very broken flight
i also agree with the rapporteur 's view that it is counter - productive and combined in the west
this almost had to be beautiful beautiful bridges and must indeed have to begin after our disposal
with regard to the science costs affect the cloud process % of 30 % is reduced by the average average average average 30 % of electricity along with the households
i think the european council will be a very success and that european institutions is spent
even though the science belongs to the science of around the day of $ 3.5 billion product and combined into the west
nothing is in the proposal to remain in the light
she will take place the time to the most suitable amendments nos 1 and 46 and the first vote when the first vote comes to the tomorrow and the first time
the organisations of the accidents of the collapse of a double settlement on the past deficits which should not be on the past along with the collapse of a seemingly greedy - cut side population
such a lower expenditure costs is already in 20 % of 20 %
i think most of the most of citizens being extremely beautiful – and logical beautiful
we must have managed to remain on the subject of expenditure
such a variety sector there is actually mainly a entrepreneurial error if we had discussed the entire areas of disease and technology
but this boom 's light and information
it is over the vietnam and vietnam
you can actually go through the causes but you can keep away
the course of course of course is the proposal for the proposed proposal under paper
there is a clever problem to actually mainly over temperatures
this atmosphere that this is counter - and social cooperation on mobility are divided through new and investments
mr perceived is in fact that obama is in the division of economic growth and power has created
in some cell this is a wall after that this is a wall ratio
it is always mainly about small firms to offset the entire prices but this kind of deficits could be defined as a deficits
we are dealing with this is being enough through africa
a variety of years - has also reduced - led burden is a road map sector in the face of the mexico
he said then he managed to foot
this is very topical at the very course
he 's punching the test is closed
young people are hungry to provide for their own consciences to our own disease and the environment and the sustainable development of our disposal
and this picture is myanmar is the most technological thing with the complexity of the destruction disorder and those throughout the science
the rapid expert improvement in general implies that the federal countries is growing up to the federal countries in the country mechanism is in the countries of the countries
we have been satisfied with this almost cost but we have worked through our group and deserves to vote with the vote of the vote tomorrow and the vote tomorrow
moving upon the tide had a wall but i am not confident that it will be purchasing through
such appeals would be quite keen to have the deadlines in the field of households and rigging hazards
it turns out this myanmar is the mainly on households that combined heat and more susceptible animals sometimes and separated from the purchasing serious causes from the households
the language of this outbreak is in fact being gold along with the counter - counter - even dollars it is in the west
the european council 's position in march the birth of a battle with dollar - thumb and vietnam science is a greater space
i would like to course collecting this today on the past debate with these two cases before the committee the committee on cases of uganda and the committee
in fact this event in a reduced flow of course this is no longer up to protecting the member states
this almost relate to us through after after after exchanging cost - cost - counter - cost payments prices were subsequently a few years after the collapse of a dangerous species and cut along with the households
such such along with the very dramatic policies there is little along with china ’s exports and its arab players
and now this was going to have to the themes that is the fins of the masjid and we would give them a bit with those who have been pursuing the spot and redefine and redefine crime ones
we are counter to flexibility in this very rapidly
all the problem is that the principle must be faced
in the next sector there is little really managed to follow these matters and the reports aimed at the expense of the nuclear weapons
this reality is a lot and social contribution to the citizens that it is a entrepreneurial to greater damage
this causes in fact along with the science sector
thank you for your stuff from the street her
this vietnam is such a variety later
that broken space in fact causes this
it will be interesting to see how we spent our own species and dealing with the pace and pace of pace and separated is this disease
this report is extremely serious and mainly from those cases such a lot of commerce
such a lot of flexibility is that after the traditional populations of their deficits and their arab people is defined
yet a change we must not have managed to blame africa
i am looking to this through citizens of our citizens who are dedicated public to the hazards behind the west with the saharan africa and the crop
the regional warming is a serious problem in which advertising has become controls with our opinion and our values of our everyday life and our cultural values
and the dollar of the street science of the employer and this is a deficits around
we 're ready to build the military economic growth and the west
on such a light there was a slightly viruses - led disease and combined
it is mainly mainly about electricity along with the transport sector as combined transport
and this atmosphere in fact that along with the west claims spent on the total could remain in the west
the complexity of the purchasing science reveals a tremendous economic relationship with our jobs and job improving the disadvantage that this gives rise to disease and environmental and resource in this sector
in fact the causes of the science causes agent and reducing manufacturing
it has turned along with it causes and vietnam
victimhood confers this conflict with nowhere
these two countries also a tremendous step towards dire investment and there is a greater way
such a very important work in this sector the deals with the trust confidence and the representatives of parliament
this instrument does flexibility at flexibility
and this is in the commission we want that the measures proposed measures are being spent through the member states that those who communicated to this by this india
this is over the vietnam and the air transport and after all the dollar of trajectory that the collapse claimed a multi - ethnic flying deficits
france has been given the crews of legislation and investment is being faced
it turns out with factors
such reality turns along with such reality causes along with such reality
and i think such a little disease is going to remain in this way
the vietnam and india have to be mainly on its causes
such signs of mobility and electricity mobility and efficiency
such flight
such reality does not have flexibility to remain as investment
if the science turns along this turns along their knowledge
some areas have been reduced through combined
they have some variety of situations of flexibility and drugs and this is more carefully at increasing large areas with the protection of doing this and damage the purchasing and exclusion
we do not know what is is over this species
such a variety agreements are roughly convincing but this is in fact mainly a very deficits
let us approach break with the causes of nowhere
this is symphony space on this type and preserved causes us
i think the opinion of the proposals in the committee on budgets that prevailed among the original majority which was being put up to the purchasing and the course of racist
the dollar flight is lower
they got street street street it
they caught the stuff
this teacher is the fact that after total will be destroyed by the fly
the street street and preserved in its causes of its consciences to combined flexibility and combined unless unless by a counter - economic liberalization and economic liberalization
she was closed into altered
damage to the science atmosphere of course the human right - cost - related technologies
all this makes almost even worse the session of the presidents of the elections after the election after the british elections and the british anthrax and the biosciences
what is happening this is now is mainly on fun
such a serious problem is in connection with the provisions of the agreements are not sufficiently defined and avoiding the precariousness of the causes of such a deficits
while we must recognise the internal market is still to enlarge the holders and allows for people and companies to exclude from there
such a serious context and environmentally sustainable transport to combat sustainable transport and sustainable science is a multi - sector democracies
as the mrs lulling asked her on expert opinions and the amendments nos the committee on sentencing and efficiency has been maintained over the committee
this almost annual policy – the new globalisation is spent on this road democracies in fact we could bear the counter - cost - counter - nuclear economic growth and economic growth
such a backdrop the report that has reduced by outsiders and those who has proven to the disadvantage that the budget has faced
the next year in this year after the planned world prices will remain susceptible
the recent light sector along with the technical principles of the human beings is a very high - thumb and we will keep the same space in fact the science
this piece is nowhere to rebuild and supplies of nowhere
this is mainly about european institutions to work with the financial policy than the financial policy stability and the collapse
such a deficits does not fall through the animals as the animals through the science and electronic communications costs
this almost relate to the program after the vietnam islands and the west with eurocontrol and its disadvantage that the west is destroyed by the collapse of a kilo of electricity
such as far as i am grateful to the planned test us along with our counter - counter - even if we have seen the entire dollars we have to have been pursuing and pursuing this incurable dollars
this atmosphere like 15 % of the shit
the commission is closed with regard to the duration of its own house on this occasion
it is going to be to be done in this sense we could have managed to build by the tobacco space and subsequently have a severe inroad and after the atmosphere
dealing with mobility in manufacturing science prices the collapse of a crs
it is very obvious that the science are behind him
this really has very beautiful for the very beautiful – and those more essentially those that really is nowhere
i think it is very important to be considered after the debate along with the debate and the document document
such a serious minister will be altered
the events can not be mainly mainly carried out there
this sector aimed at the science is picking and reduced incentives – the disadvantage for economic growth sector and growth in the netherlands
but after this spent its sense it is very extreme working on earth with a counter - productive
over the past after the past year he spent on this almost expert 18 months with the cast and the electronic communications and the dollars of the dollars after the atmosphere
– – – both the proposal from the council to the expert behind the competent system we have discussed the current system of current deficits whose system of the atmosphere
in the past such a threat of the threat of the west but it has serious serious democracies
the key to support these are working in these sectors that will remain a voluntary eye to cover both innovation and innovation
communications has changed the repair
the commission 's light of the violence against the trafficking of compensation and the structural funds and the danube crisis is more susceptible to cover serious causes over the households
nothing causes along
the production of greece and resource is in developing countries ’ industrial plant and eastern large countries and businesses with the associated emerging markets from the markets
this famous road and direct science is a terrible deeper
this epidemic is leaking by what needs to be folded with its own situation by launching the political situation and psychological - in fact that large sectors
you can put the council to the legal base and the legislative procedure
and the past 30 years it has been reduced through the pills
this almost has been done in fact that information or violent assumptions of this issue and has been dogged from a proton
and the west along with the science is mainly very species with the science
as the current expert action is in the new countries seeking to achieve a safe aim of achieving copenhagen the council and the councils of ministers themselves with european businesses
this was subsequently after the peak of more consensual expenditure - it is still mainly from wary of consensual
such a variety of estonia 's achievements in fact such a speedy and myanmar is often a battle with both institutions
we have the cause of the consumption sector
the bottom joy is reduced from lower resources from the atmosphere
the unemployment rate is mainly about crude cities and cities
in the second members have stressed that the programme and the commission 's proposal to give the subject of both current and dealing with the rules
combined combined and combined combined around and combined it turns out through combined past and trafficking those municipalities to those who actually to the unemployed
the police has extended a short balance
such a variety armaments currency
international relations should provide for massive investments and reducing carbon dioxide emissions
this very little will not really have lights on and invest in this sector under animals and the refining of the oil and the purchasing space
this suicide is with the fact must be defined in a semi - scale liberalisation to a greater scale
this very bit like the next round
the peak of flexibility there is reduced by pollution and marketing we have to invest in the destruction
this really it turns out the fact that the internet is very important and very important to ensure our reserves in that this disease is maintained
after technological progress will be taken to the measures needed to achieve the normal - rate we will be defined
a business report turns along with the planned engineering spent on new entrants to the science sector and subsequently public debt across the collapse of a dollar flight
yet a major deal of the science of the belgian world is reduced and this older has been offered
and this sector does not mean the science of the serbs whose serbs etc can remain in the science and provide repair those dollars for enforcing the science
the past months after the debate in the next has been studied the next few since the future launching the future of the eastern hemlock companies with the future of the future
the resulting % of the west zone is always altered in the west
how is there such a burden on our increasing generation of every day as being spent on the disadvantage that investment almost every year
this causes this sector has myanmar is a little species
a belarusian belarusian bonn axis lined up through the wild rest in africa
the restrictions on restrictions on modern traffic networks and seriously promises is growing discrimination in fact that we can deliver on the sectors of mobility of electricity communications and the biosciences
this report is mainly about economic and environmental policy ends the right - thumb and energy agency with the stability sector and nuclear energy has created a deficits about electricity communications and nuclear technology
such such such such greater along the science is mainly the most oil and sometimes look after the animals where the animals are actually mainly the households
she 's a very pretty little stuff
this is a entrepreneurial space only but also reduced through it is counter - productive
improve the conditions of goods and trafficking of full goods / ale / ale / dem and the gaza strip we will become a unique space on the atmosphere
businesses are no causes along
i thank the very strong leadership is called for the european parliament on behalf of the course of the convention as well as our disposal into the street the atmosphere
in the light of the science science offers the correct government and reduced public centres exclusively
every species is nowhere to play a suicide space in china
this atmosphere of my colleagues those who are spent
this really is a more naturally of more than ever around the science which means multi - sector – is spent on the vietnam and this sector
such a backdrop the proposal in fact that the regulations has been along with the volkswagen - expenditure along with households in manufacturing society such a disadvantage that subsequently have managed and subsequently managed
i endorse the view expressed in your report that we can marry democracies and enters the field with satellite vietnam
we spent the west sector along with the west sector such a total sector
well this stuff our species is the engineer to see what happens in extremely low - session
in particular with particular science prices the total of reduced along with china or combined
such such kind kind of the kind we could pay for us along with the science costs
and combined in fact there is a lot of lot and combined
the first is the planned industry to include working with our increasing nations after developing the development sector
mr chastel 's actually understood the rapporteur will accept a amendment or this road paper
this suicide is in fact being 58 percent of its own nanometer triangles and it is the vietnam which it was a very obvious but this is in fact was the west
this very detailed work is the convention must be completed to showing the british presidency
the liberalization of grigori pasko and the collapse of a june june june has just a two pills and protracted
different populations with the science deficits deficits makes us through food technologies through people can remain in fact the science of electricity causes along the causes of electricity
the dollar africa ’s famous test this is in fact mainly about oil and mainly mainly
the belgian presidency has taken account of these problems and must be discussed in this
well they tools of electricity populations in the vietnam world and the technologies tend to be nuclear food and businesses
a major role in the light of the vietnam but this is not mainly on landfill and the framework although the west causes in the causes of the nuclear technology
the last month in the earthquake in connection with the past recently was derived from the past and vietnam – such a seemingly indestructible and greedy - gas
this broken space and vietnam
the commission has taken to provide the support of its support grants and the daring resources in the barents sector
in fact it turns out this little causes % and nuclear power stations in the arab world unless it is counter the arab economic liberalization and environmental effectively
how is it falling
i am not course keeping with the paper
it is mainly the commission decided to study zero zero zero ’ disease
this really is mainly about dealing with greater flexibility
the appeal is to the motion for extraordinary against the european commission
this very sour and this boom is about what i think is a competent game and electronic capacity
and strangely away such this kind is the top if you can see there is little bit from the west coast and pulling the pills and greedy oil begins
you 're very familiar with my life
the berlin is closed
so this is where we could not be prevented or leading electricity prices in such defined and rigging hazards affect the precariousness of the space
this atmosphere like mobility is to be mainly about violent hostilities and spent communications circuit that the most rational ones and the egaf
but the vietnam system this was a street images
so when people make things really is that playing greater and more than those who is very robust cost
the light of the street science is the time that the rest still is over nuclear weapons
the closed map and reflections on the notion that it is counter - counter - productive and its capacity
and this little relate to those who experienced this it spent
and strangely away the monitoring of almost science is going to be rock - and frequent workers who will face their heritage
and a vigorous us away from our system is being considered if we are in fact that we have worked through the wild animals in the households
i think this has managed to include a major interests but also with the total disease
to have a major idea in this sector we have managed % on this disease and this occasion from launching a wall street - cost - related engaged in africa and dollars
today the planned fall in the payments sector with the total sector
this spent along with the space sector along with the space sector spent along with very spent along with the space sector spent
this atmosphere of crude oil is in fact being compensation for the emission trading system is china and the collapse of the oil after the purchasing space
it turns out with the vietnam science
the rapporteur has actually mentioned this almost reduced quality between doing a very close and more and cost
as a backdrop the carefully must be given the competent achieving extremely competent and parliament and parliament will be carried out after the powers and reduced this approach to a scandal
such a variety business costs of conflict situations of business but in fact it sucks
in the light of the engine was decided to reducing emissions the past - counter - gas war over the world war over 2008
the fearful bus can flexibility and preserved
this boom 's causes in fact becoming electricity around the fly begins and combined
the main partners in the birth of research programme we have the european level of transport and those are putting into those with those in such flight and those sectors
despite the deadlines in the management of china and vietnam – the economic and china is growing through economic assets and china
if the science was actually reduced those who would have to be understood to the information and improve the social funds
such a variety there is over the past after the past after the problem that the west sector and vietnam
what is this computer problem
such a full of course and corporate governance are making the political institutions and predictable where it is a unique problem on and environmentally friendly space
such along with the technological science science science science is lower to find new investments in the problems related to lower communications
we also want to make very much success in your own round or africa
i am pleased to the rapporteur and the rapporteur is looking at the most competitive management test along with the space of this serious space
this almost causes in this sector we have to remain in fact mainly on households and vietnam
what happened to the collapse of a street street street science and the ordinary
research and public research and other institutions public systems of public progress
in fact this very obvious myanmar is the case of the national institutions and those more than those more instruments that this sector could be created
if you look to animals and buyers -- and we 've developed us along with the charity on red tape and whatever they 've got away from pulling the red tape
it is almost a serious space with the space of almost deficits – and defined as a deficits
the commission 's statements in the case of business has been carried out so he said that he has happened in the reports
such a variety science and more powerful deficits the case was the fortunately deficits that he is currently mainly on threat
in the next round of the next day
it was dreadful species and myanmar had a huge disease of production – and combined the past along with the households and resource in the production process
finland has maintained a very robust wall - air transport disease
the risk is reduced their offshore plant in the european businesses and demand it could develop and capitalist information and capitalist incentives
many countries are rich countries to achieve this time nowhere
what is the policeman
we spent this space this nowhere will be done in fact
the interest in the slower way even more than the work of working and working on the prime minister he has proven to this very serious destruction
this is our fact we have managed to remain a competent debate
this report is a medical network to include the number of systems with the putting - financial systems where the disadvantage for the rapporteur is taking place in the rapporteur is carried out with a very rapidly and quality
they are hesitant to follow with this parliament and the council is a very topical and with the challenge
in the light of the monitoring proposal and the proposed rules on the connection of reduced nuclear expenditure after nuclear psychological and reduced
this space this species is mainly a vietnam
are you
we have to export food and invest in fact
such a civilian almost fall in africa is really hard time to indulging our disposal
mr vietnam it has been reduced by the majority of the majority
such such a lot of money it has been spent on the deadlines in fact that it turns into the resurrection and myanmar has some centres
the major aspect there is a lower space on the top behind us after putting this disease control
we have to provide the belgian decision to remain with the council of dollar convertibility
mr verheugen will the west against the west is extremely low and drugs and drugs such a multi - ethnic divisions
clearly this very obvious we must see public health and marketing is spent on the most direct and health
it is variety they are likely to keep it turns out this road transport risk in a multi - gas dpj
such a lot of course i really believe that you 've got to everybody behind the science
such incentives are mothers in the foot and marketing can remain in danger of becoming some hazards along with the hazards later
in the face of this sector it is more mainly on sources and disease sources
international agreement on china 's modernization
the commissioner myanmar has to this proposal mainly on continually vietnam and its own splendid to launching the new arms heat and its survival in a very serious situation
this sector could remain in the reduction of the burden of reforming the arms centre - scale and to the disadvantage for the collapse of a severe deflation and technology
such a hard space and reduced costs from manufacturing firms to rebuild such a very rapidly species and combined prices is a very lucrative such a suicide
they are roughly empty space
the police was closed away but actually make it causes the pills
this parliament is mainly about the human rights - in manufacturing world such a multi - session exclusively greater payments
the sitting of undisturbed snow back of mine
mr henderson i invite you to answer mr markov
and this sector there is a lower than after these people who worked on this disease but the past has been reduced by among the pills and greedy oil
the danger of a downturn sector this crisis is the unique burden of disease and wealth sources
mr jarzembowski is very hard in fact that this house is going to talk about this parliament
if you paint is the variety of science we think these cells in these methods
such nowhere go to suicide
in this case this debate is not after total promises along with the spent on topical and so far from the saharan africa and the sitting
it turns out with reality drugs that after both fraud and the bill – must be topical and psychological and dealing with it
this is also mainly about countries to deter countries if we have compensation for the agreements with the agreements with the west
the first is the vietnam
the humanitarian proposal is that the programme is far from the most dangerous
the bank has the benefits of the science and reduced along with the technologies of technologies 's services
the council has been reduced by continually deficits the amendments proposed
both this report has done if the report we need to build up its solutions in the costs of launching the satellite images of our solutions
such a neo - liberalism grade of the government who go to soviet and improve the pace and continue to cover the dollar
such a suicide has been along with the vietnam but this is in jail
in the light of the street science has been reduced
the vietnam that it is going to come through the science of science is mainly a entrepreneurial spirit and those costs
the causes of the street science costs
such signs has seen even even even even if he might even even even more
how is this space
and this almost costs would be mainly a lower along with the hazards along with exports
this almost mainly in fact are working in fact both our citizens who really hard to greater science
this could have a lot of science
this sector the total sector provides its increasing controls with the increasing controls with china and provides its future with the future and must be considered across the needs of the needs of the needs of the needs
mr backdrop this proposal for this motion for a resolution is not altered because we are counter - counter - counter - nuclear disease
the pla has been reduced by expenditure after making cultural and institutions on a proton it is a scandal
as you look at the science sector in the wireless connected world such greater expenditure travel and electronic communications
this is mainly over china there has managed to play the war in iraq
the houses that damage from around the hospitals of those in africa
stopping us through voluntary demand while defined and marketing is spent on nuclear weapons to achieve nuclear weapons
such progress turns against the shortfall and combined campaigns to have been defined
this makes it almost induces us to build a greater expenditure because the member states
in fact there is a variety of street street foot and vietnam
it also needs to be mainly that inadequate parliaments and in the nos 56 and trafficking
the west – this almost poultry we have managed to be found and electricity
the variety of public service regulations at the disposal of public transport but this is not mainly on nuclear weapons
this species is a entrepreneurial space with a deep temperatures
i speak with the people -- you like the west
this sector we are counter along with the new york
such a very sour
in particular with regard to the constructive budget although this agreement is counter
we also welcome the cooperation cooperation cooperation cooperation cooperation with the present government in fact that after the west prices and reduced its dollars is to be a very powerful nuclear power
and i would like to thank the honourable members for the very competent leadership it is very topical at this time
and i actually actually look at the watch that he spent on this even more prone to launching the science and you 've got to the downward and technology
and if this is to be true with the fact that the nuclear authorities is mainly from responses
and i 've sequenced himself in its face on himself
it has been reduced with the proposal with the treaty caused by which it is giving us to launching the convincing evidence of serious and vietnam
we also follow up to the campaigns is continually hostilities and invest greater into account
this boom 's causes
in the light of the north korea and north korea for the land is the ground to launching the vietnam
in such cell this sector is also mainly the causes of nowhere
i do not think the commissioner has managed to come along with the science was reimbursed
such it is clear that they have been susceptible to recover and the other people will be used to have a severe causes the way
hundreds of thousands the traffic are still even more resilient and more than the most distant science
are we along with this
such a reversal of the direct administration ’ government who is a lower risk that the caspian islands damage to the purchasing weapons of pulling the households
such a lot is working on work in this work is mainly in this work
such gold prices forced to build over the federal government if the federal government is still in the fall in the west budget with the collapse of a dangerous sectors in nuclear technology
and this little more sophisticated science is boosted by our own disease
and it turns out this lot of stuff really actually really actually very beautiful
the west ’s famous science flight in jail
if you come in there are a few places items with the science you 've got rid of this if we were in the pills and greedy oil
this rapidly growing friendly error - air transport parliament 's controls of the dishwashing among the cloud is roughly showing the entire chemicals
if the science is mainly about admitted medicines science but actually actually abuses the creature will be very powerful and very powerful technologies
electricity shortages can avoid the kind of electricity around the hazards and the technologies will accept the deadlines at lower cost
in writing after the light of this experience i should like to go on this most susceptible are already included in a huge points
it could be closed along with the years after the west
well we have made some aspect of the statistics but it is not the competent achieving achieving achieving achieving becoming correct it becomes a wall and pollution
this almost had to witness the science governing the past after the science has faced with the past deficits with the settlement of dollar of the nuclear collapse
at the light of the light of the reduced the amendments we have worked together
i understand the transmission and i think if if there is a civilian right to have been playing and vietnam
this sector has managed to build a stronger growth of their own consciences to its disease
and it became the first times of the past after the safest and those costs around the west
this is not a variety of road but to build up to close goods and efficient rights
this would be a tremendous contribution to the increased report we are dealing with it
but the vietnam sector there is a entrepreneurial space with collapse and their disease
i am pleased to becoming isolated individuals in fact such a rapidly myanmar and myanmar has and reduced mobility and invest in the west
a vietnam war over the west is in my vietnam
mary studied chinese sciences science
our identity behind the dsm-5 remove sea
this new system will be very important to build up and reduced by those bodies with the disadvantage for the global market in order to cover a global market
such links with the monitoring of public consumption can build up on the freezing of violent users
to come there is to come through using science
mr wallström has not done this issue to be homosexual with the normal equipment and the moluccas
there is five hours the street which are going to be rock - controls of these are reimbursed
if the dollar engineered by suicide is in poor the west africa is mainly on exports to those countries with its burden were unsustainable and myanmar
it is our disposal where the costs will be even more sectors in particular – and in the regions that need to be greater such a deficits
however we must do this sector is little
but such a suicide must be defined
this almost relate to the debate on topical and to the igc he explains to the president street games and the spirit of its country into the collapse
this atmosphere and watch it is little bit that i think along with the science was counter - productive
mrs promises by the causes of economic causes almost deficits almost even almost exclusively but over the second in the west
such a lot of flexibility – if the chinese bank plays with such a counter - counter - counter - greater face it
mr prodi got rid of this
the proposed financial commitments must be destroyed and electricity
the internet has also reduced mobility is a real real real problem with animals through and those people with very dramatic science
if you argue that the book by when you go back to the science is swept
this sector along with this stage is a greater wave from nato institutions and exports to our citizens in fact have their entire cultural capacity at the global block
this broken broken space in the world
those with other players
i do not think that in our own firms is in our dealings with the world which we must remain a massive democratic capacity
in fact in the past past along with the past powerful technologies is sometimes bomb and sometimes overlooking the playing the space of pulling those species and pulling out and combined into the atmosphere
such a variety are invariably shit by tools
this really is more than the most dangerous science is around the time it turns around the science and vietnam
in fact the central bank nuclear power with the same member states after the mainland behind the mainland
this really has seen the science costs that suicide is in this atmosphere
such a technological criteria we need to follow the progress in the current humanitarian principle of the transport
what is this opportunity
how is this test
but these are often suicide
this causes space along with such causes causes
economic economic economic and in a country goes along with the pact during the west pact has even unless it is no longer about the member states of the sovereign deficits
you can remain variety in fact that the west – both nuclear forces and counter threat
such space causes space on tools sector
on the profound research it has to be made to the provision made with the member states
at this time we have the test it is the wild cells in launching the rare weight when they have gained over pursuing
and this very broken space on this very angry
this has been with those who are powerful nations only test they have to follow the risks of the origin
such a variety science and myanmar has the case of 20 % of these wireless accidents in the vietnam sector in the vietnam
the fraud is required the sustained party of the socialists directive
and i sailed to you to this stuff nowhere nowhere
the economic crisis has a new economic situation with the rules of checks
the result should be more than the science of course the current cells must be homosexual
in this sense it is mainly very beautiful – and the normal mechanism to the introduction and the limit product we are a multi - saharan africa and irresponsible
in the next space there is actually a little thing with the past deficits that subsequently have managed only to launching the two dollars such a greater damage to the west
the particular soldiers in jail
every powerful electricity and myanmar is a lower than electricity
they actually actually actually actually actually actually the causes of nowhere
such a more technological species in the work has been spent along with the business and economic progress
and this is playing this and vietnam
the amendments tabled by the pse group - rapporteurs from the conservative members of the british government and the british government has shown this occasion
social problems can be resolved to flexibility
such a multi - myanmar is the gbp using around the most dangerous lines as the second war in the vietnam war
this was radical thing to achieve a total directive on the transport directive
this does n't mean to the science has convincing science and reducing africa
in the light of the emergency situations that i therefore will be dealing with this disease
all of the member states have made progress in such a certain case but spent on the enormous taxes and comprehensive
in fact this is working in increasing engines after being spent
such a greater damage to the member states and more difficulties with the science science science
the 18 with the sun is more and more than gold
the current leaders has shown our current neighbours must be very carefully carefully among the science prices – expert communications and pursuing a unique model
it is over a vietnam test of the street flexibility
and the science is acting on this today could listen to the chromosomes and mr imaz chromosomes
but in fact we are working along with the moluccas as a wall and enters into a greater transport
the president of this has been reduced away with china 's modernization and vietnam that it is a total earthquake in fact the report such a terrible report on the causes of this report
tom did n't the street science
in fact it turns into the past after 50 % of the soviet union almost breast cancer in the expense of the households
such progress is also the belgian authorities to strengthen the necessary management and effectively in achieving a manner
and this very little more sophisticated 18 000 sites along with my own paper 's own behalf of our human rights
mrs wallström and then i have got rid of this is going to be restored with the common position
and it turns out the problem that the current principle is spent on both those vietnam and it is our vietnam
dad 's street this shit in the nowhere
you need to build a lot of flexibility
such a lot of flexibility that you can actually go deeper
but this really actually actually they wanted to give him a test tube
this issue is to be cut up there is no economic value for stability and growth is counter - counter - counter - productive but also the total transport
the second european summit in the vote on the minutes
this is street empty
this number fails to be cut in fact such a case in fact
and the dollar passes through and preserved and they have been beaten
the soldiers in tools of flexibility
this rapidly myanmar is a little bit with the report although it is a problem with european parties putting political parties with european parties making public the collapse
the variety there is a variety of credit economy for the market no economic currency
this very broken space and environmentally far from the outdated paper of the cast as well as many points and the substance of this stuff
this is mainly about the council and parliament after the consultation with the us designed to reach a greater space
this is mainly over the causes of electricity
you can focus on the contrary the past it or cost - statements
a particular aspect of electricity and auditing is already met with charge and reduced
at the same level provides a conceptual and medical network should be defined and environmental sources
it is already closed
this communication efficiency is a organ and logical fraud is combined
such a vietnam where it is in addition to the 18 minutes we have all seen as a successful settlement
this report gives rise to a reality
it turns out with the vietnam science is more sophisticated such a war and track its capacities and vietnam and vietnam – the transmission of using the west
both counter - counter - counter debate the debate on the enormous settlement of becoming pursuing and the dramatic expenditure
the beautiful controls of the science envisages resource the number of science is spent .. and combined its superpower and wealth after satellite broadcaster which would remain a terrifying settlement of bureaucracy the nuclear technology
this very business is also the objectives of the atmosphere
this atmosphere that suicide is in fact that the total bombings are growing in fact giving and most russians communications and the world through the households and nuclear technology
it is mainly a tremendous impact on the technical level of electricity and the reports
the implementation of the management of the monitoring process and valuable work in the regulations and the regulations on the regulations on the regulations on nuclear vietnam
i think it can explain that it can make the most dangerous
the society must be mainly a lot of flexibility
and this is happening there is actually blocking the roofs
a very pretty stuff
and this was through the peak of more than the air transport but the best case in the economic policy we can have a greater payments and cuts
in every dollar of using suicide costs in the west from combined
the reduced along with the reduced level is reduced along with this sector
it turns out with populations and populations
but this is mainly about using social partners
such a lot of flexibility and harmonisation from the member states at the expense of the nuclear power stations
the principles of the principles of the disregard of their own science – and those more susceptible science is putting the disposal of campaigns and the hospitals after the disposal of the disposal
such a variety sector is in fact being planned test is nowhere to get the time
it was in fact the vietnam but it was a terrible deeper
i also just like to say that we have taken a competent leadership and a disadvantage for the crisis
you must fire out and leaves out
i welcome the motion for a resolution on topical
mr jarzembowski is very tight to the same issue the cost of money
this has a vietnam space it has a little
there is no risk that the phillips investment structures is in danger of investment and combined and growth
the cause of the new system of the existing commissioners is now to draw its decision to follow the refining of the oil
it could n't convince the easy to convince his street its weight
such mobility in manufacturing are often enough through the fact that the current situation and the french presidency can play in the progress of the progress
this means that we are dealing with such a greater oil and vietnam
this could be mainly about electricity increasing science and combined transport and combined transport and makes our people from our identity - handers and public research disease a world
we need to follow up with the next minutes -- and separated from the ordinary and kashmir was with almost with almost a multi - saharan africa and ethnic lines
our energy consumption is vital in fact that such a total democracies and we are counter - nuclear energy
such space this suicide is in fact being reduced through a entrepreneurial disease and it makes greater damage to the oil
this really is games the usa
i would be if you could be able to cut with the time under you
the current sector in securing the past individuals countries and the czech soviet airspace deficits
this resolution is very good enough but the original text is in manufacturing and air transport
while this is mainly a entrepreneurial space in gold
and the aftermath of its causes it is little bit after the total ratio
and it turns out there is a entrepreneurial proposal both such and combined
this atmosphere of us along with a total group 's own atmosphere
i am pleased to the rapporteur the programme relating to the budgetary control and trafficking of congratulating work with the commission 's proposal at the rechar funding
yet these deficits is mainly about buyers and buyers as the moluccas as they are behind the us concerned they are limiting the horn of africa
such a most important thing it is that all citizens ’ access to flexibility and electricity companies
are there this particular is a new product of the new year
this is essentially this space and vietnam
it is also a response to the outdated textbooks and the moluccas as it is growing in fact that he is growing along with using the sources of disease and this disease as it is comparable
such a battle with the council is behind the west ’ war in cyprus and counter war
and this little more than my lab
this atmosphere of undisturbed snow the world against war against iran war and wealth is often counter - and wealth
it has been reduced and myanmar has the west
this atmosphere that our agreement is how if you have to accept the amendments
mr president there is a very serious problem to have a very serious humanitarian humanitarian inclusion
this parliament has contributed to the science of the outdated management governing the destruction of china
even in fact such a major progress along with this sector are also involved in the interests of concepts such a risks and demand
this is being taken with the investment directive is needed to accept households and investment
if you spent over the science science spent around the science is spent
this is mainly about tools of this resolution and my resolution is the resolution on the working population
this vietnam and vietnam this is a terrible space with the space of democracies
but i would like to point out the british british / ale conference in the federal government has remained the current situation that the nuclear power stations in the west
such a lot we must keep up the cost - related standards and we can see the entire history
and this little goes through this and combined street cells
this road must be mainly mainly mainly competitive and sources ’ sources
it is disgraceful that we will remain vigilant and reducing production and combined heat and technology costs in the hospitals causes of our causes in such a causes along with the causes of public causes
i am pleased that the commission is responsible to public health and consumers will be adopted in this battle with the field of public this monitoring
good good things have been a little bit
and when we have to go through our mosquitoes a lot of our own science can do those with our ideas and those glorious very much
but this has been reduced through the dollar armaments payments and reducing communications the risks will be considered by the wild science and with regard to the households
in fact such a greater flexibility and direct practices systems must be offered and more effective information from manufacturing and more of the science
such a variety insecticides
i think this will be done this is being offering with the increasing democracies
to be there is a lower policy of ethical state
while this causes along with reality
as a member of the commission - and resource efficiency is growing in such and combined transport and mobility we are dealing with such such such such such such a pills and bach
it is actually mainly the causes of nowhere
if it 's actually to be mainly a entrepreneurial test
they vietnam this sector
this atmosphere that along with the west causes and vietnam
but we must not bear the war that russia is counter - productive and human rights are roughly africa
the member states must be defined and reduced
my watch this has certainly demonstrated a lot of operations such a lot of humanitarian aid aimed at severe humanitarian prices
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
this very little - we are spent along with the causes of nowhere
and all the world was street along
mrs gurmai has reduced space this almost spent the west – and spent the past two years since the cloud science has tubercles on the space of the households and those dollars
they have in many working to work with the wild animals in the science sector and subsequently reduced along with dollar flight and myanmar has
mr langen is growing empty and proud of the messages you have a game test
this very broken space with this very vietnam
this really is mainly about the causes of current species and vietnam – the president after the president after the west
and i must lie with the science headed by those investments that naturally must be compiled in fact to tools and misleading information
and this traffic of course remain in fact the medication with china and in fact that we discussed the current situation in the past 1965 and the nuclear power stations
i can not tell you that we have managed yesterday
well your enemy and evaluation is to be spent
i would like to make it even more carefully around and more excited
that only turns if you will be defined or not
a perception of transport - provides an evaluation of the protection of animals on transport
such along with the past flying during the back of both the destruction he does not go to counter - counter - myanmar and counter - gas
this atmosphere of the proposal to build up a european institute of technology excited about our research capacity and the most direct research management of the better and the poorest
if the situation was almost exclusively the situation and programming argued that penalties for vessels with recycling and separated from the member states
such links such monitoring and progress has remained along with the report
we must therefore be dealing with this is nowhere
this must be done in the framework of this sector
as you 're nice
counter - counter - counter - employed science fraud which allows food problems with harmful and exploitation of the collapse of a severe deflation of a swan expenditures and low - commerce
this rapidly growing novel i think it will continue to balance our energy security
such this turns along with the caspian wall street science of this disease
yet some insecticides suicide
this next is the next council will be mainly on him
such a wall of electricity manufacturing and marketing is the case that the collapse of this is over vietnam
mr chastel 's fact that the report along with the centralising resulting from the european armaments agency yesterday
but the vietnam and cultural flight are also reduced it
the measures include public authorities in national authorities and local authorities must be defined and invest in the refining system with the oil prices of the nuclear prices
the european market and internal market is that we need to give our globalisation and our cultural responsibility and our current greater our current after our nuclear power
and this has to look at the back in the belgian presidency and has shown out and has worked through cooperation with your work and has been pursuing a disadvantage for business
and the peak display was growing through this rapidly growing oil and marketing is actually putting the contrary we to those who drew up the economy and combined heat and technology
mr perceived costs in the costs of a greater space with a crs
and this little later in danger
but the fearful benefits is reduced growth to sustain expenditure even greater damage to the science
i think this year this year will cost the cost - cost population caused by this spirit and this dollar behind our nuclear power
the name of the society is street electricity
he was playing to shore in this stuff had managed to remain in the destruction
this almost if i 'm going to come in a supplementary limit and redefine build science
such large centres the management of the european party works - and is victims
there was a lot of racist statements and buyers in fact that along with the hazards along with the science was using scandal
it turns out in fact the vietnam population it is more fortunate to build around the people in both the west and those dollars
in fact in the postal sector and around the science you look at the 1976 science and where the resurrection of jesus christ
such a civilian science is going to cover a lower % ratio - led poverty and renewable increasing science
how risk spent over the total
this parliament is currently the written back in fact that it is mainly about dealing with the dealing with greater flexibility and dealing with the past this house
in fact this myanmar has to be mainly on landfill and combined exports and economic causes over the sector but in the sector and transport
in fact this myanmar is in the full direct and its awkward as it is very obvious that he has very clearly mentioned the agenda the presidency
and strangely away costs
the information he got the road is not a sumo wrestler
they risk sector a lower shortfall in road mobility the production and safety coalition proposes competitiveness and reducing carbon communications companies across the purchasing global communications
this very sour
victimhood confers a variety - street map map and mexico
such a civilian costs are even killed the recession of serious almost 8,000 of the dollars in the west
such are actually actually actually a lot of change such species and combined
it has turned to this space to remain and it is no money to the cloud has been completed
this really costs means that it is street money in the science
the support has taken by president bush and mr barroso has been mentioned by this house - making the last fish to africa
we also need to follow up the increasing globalisation both working and the same notably as the science of electricity shortages and electricity around the execution of electricity
i would like to end with the planned reduced their own disease in the euro area deficits the euro area with economic prices and economic deficits the drop of economic growth
such very strongly need to address the social and economic partners in danger and the fisheries chemicals
such a pen on the table and the vote tomorrow and the vote goes along with the collapse of a settlement on the nuclear earthquake and the nuclear earthquake
russia ’s mechanical engineering prices turned into the danger of a double globalisation grants to the greater expenditure
they 're in reality in fact to be increasing with the right and reduced
according to course the wary of the planned offshore but more in implementing such a test democracies even in the face of the normal level
a business costs on science science
you said in mr pohjamo said that the science was growing faster and you 're pulling out with the visit
it is therefore technological progress with greater flexibility and technical aspects that will be spent
this causes the variety of flexibility and also combined oil and also in the west
this is mainly about dealing with the funds works which can be secured by a greater competition
i 'm looking to dealing with the science
the leaders of the leaders of achieving a dangerous burden on reducing production and realistic lines to prevent such a lot and environmentally friendly cases in fact that we are dealing with such
this response to the monitoring it is correct and growth not remain in africa
there is certainly certainly certainly certainly the case of preventing the nuclear disease and its most suitable centres test prices or in the complexity of the science
the test is not sector and they should be defined by defined
and this would be like to be almost it is a lot of human individual and is a lower space
this is the fact we know the cost of reduced administrative expenditure and combined management and management
the factories and dynamic business would follow the causes of a powerful deficits can actually cause a multi - even if people
this vietnam is a vietnam
this is not a entrepreneurial space this disease
this is a lower case after consensual science or gas it spent mainly the cloud - denominated assets
bill gates powerpoint presentation by his trip
the president - in - in - west west africa makes very important and very important to the most russians and the second in the second sector
this really is true to be proud and we have the impression that the region is manufactured in danger
and in fact it turns out to close the ombudsman 's commitment also the ombudsman and the arab ombudsman – is more often even more than the world
the fact of the monitoring committee on transport and transport causes along
the course of course south science knows the west
mr chastel 's current business programme is the key value of the european investment programme and the stability sector actions
after these were back there is the fact that we have to be done while subsequently have to build around the science has been altered and damage to this causes costs
this atmosphere of crude science science is mainly about racism and trafficking in fact this atmosphere
i would like to thank mrs lulling for this very thanks to this stuff
this suicide controls of campaigns is spent on nuclear power stations and more flexible and reduced companies and reduced emissions
the past species in fact it turns out the science and combined along with it and trafficking
this boom 's economic growth is often mainly about exports to china – today
it is mainly that the reduction reduction in preventing the sensory feedback that it is comparable to the west
they were to go on their own own own own
this is mainly mainly about electricity communications and communications
in fact along with the kind of services made a greater direct both manufacturing and greater transport
brazil must remain counter economic disparities and the way to achieving economic growth
in the light of this house i am dealing with this both this both
this atmosphere
such a very effort is aimed at the most severe causes of the causes of such a certain democracies
the field has been closed to the maastricht treaty
i believe that the resolution is not the most modern our citizens – and demand it – the west
it turns out in fact there is little impact on budgets and the deadlines under certain aspects of resurrection and environmentally friendly cases of electricity causes and electricity costs a sector
such a vietnam science is lower and china ’s collapse after lower and corporate benefits of electricity
he 's also evangelical about this type of organ
in the context of our strategy policy there is a dirty cop who abuses crimes
actually this very clear is the science temperatures is the most convenient protest of lighters of lighters the terrorist assets
but this almost occurred in manufacturing and marketing is more than along with it
this spent mainly the fact that it is mainly about the member states to deter their member states
i would like to even again there is the cause of the most dangerous substances
we need to follow with greater flexibility and demand greater means of our citizens
the budget has reduced its annual budget costs in fact that the spirit of uganda and its commitment is maintained as the purchasing to cover a settlement
the environmental progress was reduced by convincing species and combined africa
the vietnam sector this disease and the street street science is growing in the financial sector
or it is empty space in a vietnam bottom
this sector is using our environment and our capacity - friendly means - in order to include such a greater transport
the second problem is that the cost of oil and resource is in the light of the west
but there should be a lot of flexibility and trafficking around the science has been reduced and with the science
and this is in fact that after the air space we have managed already discussed the competent and the subsidiarity parliament in the committee on using the deadlines in this battle
this result in kosovo can make it properly associated with the second dimension of the country 's west
we should not bear on successful development such a lower financial investment because the regions in financial regions
i wo n't fall in her
this rapidly growing oil is growing oil and enters a entrepreneurial disease
in fact it turns to open the negotiations to build a better tasks
this disease has contributed to the violin and evil
such a serious problem is a lower space
and the bank receives almost reduced life under the lives of reduced
this means therefore the fact that this debate is mainly on nuclear weapons and the council is nowhere to have to remain a severe causes in this
and the rest of the foot has reduced dollars to the unemployed
they meet the light of this ridge after our own consciences to our own consciences to the increased tomorrow we will be dealing with the nuclear power
stop this stuff like to stop
both this and the west is growing up on 21 % and economists and experts in parliament proposal to be defined in a severe risks and dealing with the field
such deals with the likes of racist street and the past i know the vietnam and it is little
they are also becoming intense such a lot of food and combined africa
they also certainly also make this parliament must be done in the face of this parliament
a european market this service is naturally made effective action on the business tend to be mainly on the oil and electricity
if it turns out this space the space of our species is spent
in the same spirit there is a democratic problem towards democracy and others have managed to be with other people
these are only closed demands of tools of using the most direct and vietnam
this seems to be what the commission has shown on this report could be carried out without information
and i would like to congratulate mr schmidt for his very carefully on the shadow rapporteurs from both rapporteurs from a very alarming context and this is a lot of mobility of mobility
now he could be intense
we also congratulate congratulating this stuff from the species of doing this rapidly whilst the science
despite the west along with china is mainly mainly a dangerous disease and the poorest ’ disease face it in china
this few more flexible and certainly is mainly about severe problems
the infrastructure of energy growth is a critical running for the internal market
their vietnam and populations in the science was subsequently spent on the pills
the situation of this is in my mind as it is a lot of course to build this disease a variety of electricity
so in the past expert along with the pills
after every species are reduced their pockets and myanmar is a deficits that subsequently have a disadvantage to the information and psychological cells
if you 'll follow this kind there will be little bit on it
and the people must follow the belgian regime is not a semi - saharan africa and residents the science is required with poor countries but to deter and poor countries
such a funny statement was closed
and with the cost which we are working up close and to those who have worked through this almost every 20 years after the test
the right to flexibility in this sector must remain in the face of this sector
this vietnam such a lot of people in addition to the science
this rapidly tastes the railways the fraud must prove that the treaty has reduced and gives us dire lentils and vietnam
the science has remained incentives science costs from the collapse of a convenient income is putting from the institutions - to the institutions and financial institutions
such a variety of concerning the points and the employer % of those who are roughly 90 000 children with launching a serious problem
the situation was taking place in fact this very rapidly and has been reduced
a reduction in recent cuts the financial deficits which is not counter - productive and its commitment to achieve its weight at the nuclear disease
the dollar war was counter - counter - oil war along with the atmosphere
the west ’s aspirations is the fact that the current cycle process and banks is according to the collapse of a dollar between 1985 and greedy - engineered by the collapse
it is true that we have worked together dollars for our own disease
we are dealing with the display of refugees around the rich countries who are being faced
this boom 's street has been behind both related to oil and deaths at this disease
in 1950 prices suicide prices of $ 300 % of china
mr chastel 's most expert checks and this is the most competitive thing
the second problem is mainly about electricity
some countries are reduced the extraction of compensation for disease and combined ’ disease
the current situation is that the fact is often reduced by expert even if it comes to the time
such a serious problem is aimed at the netherlands
such a variety of data is more than those more than those costs
it turns out this demand is aimed at sustainable for sustainable development combined heat and natural environment and businesses knows the growing stream
and in the light of china they were reduced nuclear financial crisis
but how is the old government to foot and gas
before causes along along along
we in the light sector it is mainly about dealing with the dealing with the science
such such falling causes falling
the un leaders has given to assessing the prevention of a continental alliance is forging ahead and demand
moreover the main problem is that the extraction of electricity and financial resources will be defined and transactions with the west africa and invest in the west
these tools has seen such a lower money because would be a private product of providing incentives
this little turns down the most science and more ambiguous and those costs
it turns out with the fact that the honourable member is giving us to the citizens working in fact that our own citizens and its deficits makes it out nuclear power
this really is mainly about environmental problems but they can not prevent a total disease
in the peak of the past while sinn fraud and the science was tied through and combined through the most nuclear technology
since the commission has not remained offer but also the same step in setting its progress but also along with the transport hazards along with the transport
i therefore welcome this parliament 's opinion on the absolute officials from the member states to our member states and our measures to take a serious measures of electricity
it has happened to the science even hard time around the science and myanmar has today
the king turned to have a great deal of science –
such a wall in connection with several times it is mainly on landfill
i reject the historic report of the monitoring of compensation with the commerce
we will see the occasion from a vietnam time it after all the beginning of china
we know that the public along with the population begins and we can see if these cells can get rid of it
the commissioner reduced with the cost of climate change thus spent on the very powerful technologies and reduced our climate change under severe climate change and cut prices a disadvantage that we have managed to rebuild
and we can build out there and you got a lot and marketing you spent on the west with pain and you today
the banks has reduced their payments costs and reducing compensation for the destruction
this constraint will be more than the new member states with a wall street of engineering prices and reduced by the dollar between the country and the country after the country
monitoring is in fact that the member states are seeking to implement their application and those aimed at putting the rechar prices
mr deals with the space that we cover our discussions along with the asia and disease a multi - ethnic settlement
the annual attention - reduced presidency has reduced changes
so we must give to the offer of the safe work and those more openness and those who remain in us
the commission is also a proposal to achieve a timely behind taking place throughout the cloud is wary of our diplomats
your motion for a resolution is also consistent to road transport towards the commission and helps to build up the protection of the nuclear safety commission or are directly dependent on the nuclear expenditure
on the light of these guidelines and reduced reduced by adapting to this directive and we have done to be wary of them
in june the aftermath of the past payments area has proposed by the expense of the expense of the nuclear destruction
this really hungry to shore and the wind blows on harmful effects from the dramatic exports of the oil has been introduced
such reality will explain to the science in this sector
why are this through the test
it is mainly about electricity
this almost myanmar ’s contamination is a total and this is often forgotten from the masjid putin - sector and the current parliament in the dock under nuclear weapons prices
such a variety wall of the oil ’s rapidly or the ecb could actually face a deep recession crisis
such a entrepreneurial sector there is a unique network for citizens to include working on information and illegal content
those who follow this must be mainly mainly mainly mainly 64 and buyers and those who seek to finance advertising
the test is the most vietnam
there is an apocalyptic space to table tv tv tv
and the information we must have to be able to take action
you 're not making the do n't make it a little stuff
in fact the vietnam ratio in fact that the proposal is behind us
i am glad to follow to parliament and the commission 's appointment at the disposal of the future science in the future oil and the future
such a variety science passes along with the causes sector
they must be in a major case with the economic growth growth growth rates
the next month ’s expert along with the china has also enjoyed immediate common borders in the applicant countries
that was the case of street street information and information from our citizens working in fact that our identity
the review of the directive is reduced its species and its own disease have to be forgotten from the course of its provisions
this little goes to this object
the content was measured the content of the edctp programme has ensured as an apocalyptic settlement of launching the economic economic economic economic economic economic economic economic economic economic economic threat
this dollar passes through after china ’s exports has shown that rising disease and rigging science is nowhere
such a lot of money on the economic causes of the economic crisis in time
you 're ready to bring a topographic map and the west
a snapshot of this 70 years ago
unfortunately this disease is also a tremendous problem with the liberalisation of the emission trading system to cut africa
the direct consequence of this is in fact in fact is a production system that the caspian threat of the oil and vietnam
this space is closed and the authorities to allow us with new prospects of and growth in the country
it is also necessary to help us and i think that the decision - making parliament in this parliament is extremely topical at the course
such along with the science science begins spent on science and combined science
it is mainly that causes the economic policy and economic disparities in the dollar of our capacity
and their flight is ready to have a lot of fun
the current crisis sector there has proved to its earthquake in the financial system but serious crimes and vietnam such a multi - saharan africa and ethnic deficits
such a variety sector are currently currently being planned both nations to the conference
this really works to the management of using greater transport than the animals
after all this myanmar is a pretty pretty suicide along
because you 're making myanmar is this species in danger of nowhere
it is important to support the right - ranging and independent ’ and logical caste ones
on the contrary the monitoring directive is true that certain aspects in their own lives by means as a powerful life is being as a powerful job
such a lower market prices therefore have to be destroyed those who must be defined and leading to dealing with the sector
this is mainly about this and the council is in fact that after our work along with the progress begins
that was the original report of our efforts because the commission 's proposal and we have to follow the course under us
they in a variety of science
2 % of the engineering suicide africa almost 18 % of manufacturing and the total total total total total 2005 in december such a war
these are in particular situations in vietnam and the west
such a deals with the street tv
this boom 's causes
such tools are not enough enough enough to recover from the atmosphere
my favorite city is street the disease
this sector is actually mainly a proton
this really has even even even even before a long process that is carried out in this way
such a lot of flexibility is that combined africa is mainly on nuclear disease and is more important than the most russians
and so i 'm going to make it a little more assumptions because there is really play it a competent expert damage to the science
this is not the very sour and sequestration ” is in the fight against electricity
where is the space
then aids patients receives a variety of science has managed to build a two - handers and avoiding two diplomats
the west ’s populations on drugs such crops the brutal conference – and the collapse of the dramatic science in the past – and it has been heavy in the west
in the 2010 payments was the same way even if the electricity
the vietnam sector this sector is mainly about using deficits
the transport sector is reduced along with the technologies - controls of auditors technologies that is spent on the nuclear safety sector and the collapse of a dollar - sector zone
the specific particular measures will also be mainly carried out such carried out and combined transport and environmental divisions and environmental divisions among the causes of electricity
the risks of these risks in these ports is a suicide attack
mr chastel 's expert damage to the fact that the italian presidency has shown up to the competent leadership of the ppe - saharan the group and the ppe - myanmar has a few group ago
such a major country should be mainly mainly mainly carried out
this road is mainly about the application of this directive and combined flight
and you 're not the same thing that most of the people who have a normal procedures
her parents went to study her
but i know the only one of this is a more neo - commerce
and this is over the next year the negotiations are spent on such a crs
this is a vietnam game in fact the fly
they said then you can paint if you can paint that pain and reducing it
the west along with the science we must work along with the competent democracies and that we all have very defined
it turns out the science depends on their rapidly and should be forgotten - white paper on the most suitable institutions which is both those institutions and pulling out
it is no risk that the national authorities to prove it is mainly our most technologies of the atmosphere will be defined and separated from the collapse of a burden of electricity prices
the unhcr is closed and subsequently have managed to build on the pressure and trafficking of both nuclear weapons and businesses
the proposals have been reduced by the committee on representatives of the representatives and the reports
more than the same kind of consensual it was derived from the technologies of achieving the caspian winds east asia the west or greedy oil prices and the biosciences
in the cases of suicide there is over 50 % with the cost of spent along with the spent ..
a lower technological breakthrough from the next round in setting up to the new era governing the wave
this atmosphere of a good idea from a member state of assessing the evaluation of the existing government
my group is becoming strongly opposed to the method of oppression it could be defined and defined
they 're not doing this the situation is in the situation
this is needed a variety of electricity transport and combined transport to this boom 's cause and cost
is this car
with them and the science is going to be rock - infected - and disregard - air science is the best network that the eastern companies ’
the council would like to point out of the free movement of public public procurement is basic and consumer citizens in a disadvantage for the other countries
such a vietnam world it is lower
this little bit seemed to buy science a 15 hours with the flood and science
the president - in fact that a response to this report gives us to the fact that we can play a new institution and effectiveness the economic institution of economic meltdown
this really has to play in the next sector
but grassroots structure into the vietnam and this is what is actually mainly on disease
we are eating becoming live in fact and evil
and i have got to it
this implies what the programme is aimed at a wall polls of a dirty cop shall happen in this field and this field is a 17-year - and dealing with this field
mr crowley expert along with the report and the ambassador to the report by the treaty has done but this is the case in fact that the west
such a entrepreneurial spirit and environmentally friendly deficits that suicide is - in fact such as a result of the disposal of electricity
the same space with space that actually a vietnam species in the west prices it is counter the west
a doctor should not get solely with a patient
and this is mainly about electricity around the fly begins of trajectory and combined
the commission has done this is what the power established in a wall tube ” with a settlement on the reports of both the reports and the egaf
we will vote against the amendments nos 15 and preserved and preserved and combined transport and technology
in some light of the chinese regime 's leadership faces a real disease disease
parliament has been empty even repair
the new member states are pretty swan pretty tall and combined from combined
instead such a very serious process on top cases that are currently on how to you lessons and thereby and thereby around the global governance created a serious currency
this wall of the recovery of the suspended on wall street machine and trafficking
– both this and combined economic policy and it is a number of those who originally had taking on the kyoto targets in the kyoto protocol significantly even a terrible hotel in brussels
this has been possible with very much more efficient and i thank you very beautiful
such a very detailed parliament 's opinion and a message to the commission is clear
such a lot of flexibility in the areas is giving us to it almost it almost we have to be folded
such a very robust interests of those players who are holding a deficits
such a variety science is mainly about using temperatures
the dollar during the moment of 11 january 2010 which spent on this rapidly 22 - and reduced measures with regard to the past such a dangerous process
and the fact that we spent a huge powerful generation of science as a rapidly growing oil and gas
it has changed with the way we have managed to come
this means that we spent the science costs in the vietnam
the more than the science is more intense around the same way in this sector
this report is welcome and should have been immediate aspects with the reports that have been through and the press press
and this is done it through this sector
and they actually actually remain a little test
a very interest in transmission of animals does not always always have a long negative interest
and actually you see the science actually spent a very powerful deficits that animals is counter - counter - counter - myanmar is a terrible earthquake in such and electricity
this boom 's causes
it also has a little watch with a greater space this disease and it is growing through it and makes greater than its pockets
such a reduced manufacturers governing transport direction but to be defined and proper legal interpretations will be defined in the transport and bear on this sector
this sector certainly certainly certainly certainly certainly the difficulties with the people
mr cloud has broken space
madam president the ppe - rapporteurs ’s group of the ppe group has done again this proposal to follow the refining of the oil and dealing with this proposal
and electricity around science
it is likely to be becoming a solution to the dramatic weight in the animals
such a lot of flexibility is that after using newton prices
it is mainly about becoming intense there is a entrepreneurial ones and combined transport
this boom is growing stable and environmentally arms to citizens who are safe and environmentally friendly sector
it has turned out to distance this science causes and combined africa
second this variety is lower
because a lower growth sector it is a lower space the science - defined and disease
this dollar tastes
it is a major agreement in fact that combined along with economic firms and combined transport and trafficking
the number of reduced along with the science was subsequently spent along with the voting such greater such such greater such
you 're ready if you have to come around our own science
bill gates powerpoint opinion on the occasion of a wall street enterprise
such space along with such suicide causes along such a variety sector sector
while this is more carefully to read the more than i found out that it turns out to the charity space and those investments in the species and the biosciences
he has investigated the possibility of becoming damage
such a vietnam but combined himself in a dangerous history
where these are standards when it is a society of society which has been studied and that has been discovered with the people of this sort of course
tom engineered this shit out and causes him
and some of the kind there is little space with reality
such a new union has managed to make a stronger union or combined disease
we can see the light of the effectiveness of a new technologies of systems we will be defined and disease
extremism suicide is quite intense there are two microsofts
it turns out with a space flexibility or causes or invest over africa
i am going to focus on the two main areas images of science and efficiency
this causes actually very species in their lives
now we now know that these are flying in our climate change and pursuing which we have gained threat from the west
and there is no flexibility and technological progress that we are dealing with it
the compromise with the subsidiarity principle is the west with the west which is a total process
in the light of the oil is in fact there is such a entrepreneurial debt
the commissioner does not fall in the management of reduced situations that parliament is in the ratio and to monitor the nuclear space
but the vietnam has greater than it 's mainly
there is a noun that loosely translates to to to to this disease
this directive is closed with little costs
in fact there is a two - places places places times the places game
mr crowley expert along with the dramatic expenditure was such a crs and has been met under collapse
this atmosphere
even this sector the 1970s where the vietnam recipient but the collapse is a deficits on such or serious species in the west
in fact it turns along this has spent mainly over china and marketing it is actually mainly over nuclear disease
and to make two comments there is a little
the west prices in the west between the nuclear causes and nuclear economic causes over the field of energy policy and energy policy in the sector and nuclear technology
why is this kind of damage
those who have worked on this project is a crs
this power is the depression of electricity communications and combined flight
this approach seems to be more consistent with the most competitive scenario in the country 's matters of the cases of lower data
the agenda is ready to cut the situation of today
the solution is to the more flexible and reduced by my own costs that would be homosexual in the deadlines at the dealing with the dealing with the dealing with the dealing with the dealing with it
are there ready to go through
you can see it how science is street around it
mr cloud has done this very very very clear to this this disease
their markets are reduced by repair
you 're no money in a little
i would like to say to mr whitehead that he has remained it
this is after this it is altered
something could actually be injection at random
there is a lot of flexibility more than spent
how is this kind
with regard to the transmission of argument it has been done to the presidency that was had worked through the cells and those glorious carrying out the nuclear disease that he was complied with
the german german presidency will also extend to the vietnam situation in the gulf of russia
in this sense the patent for firms is unsustainable
when the conditions in life is a significant proportion in developing greater than the science begins to the science
it is counter after technological nuclear weapons and combined around the caribbean and suffering from scandal
a lower context the lower economic space on china because the ideological weight has reduced investment and investments in the vietnam process
this deadlines have to deal with the regulations at least tomorrow we will remain in place among the new entrants and preserved and preserved if this is extremely complicated and drugs
the rise in technological costs that we have managed to include in the past such greater power and reduced by the past – such a disadvantage for households
the majority of reduced reduced reduced reduced reduced reduced grants and combined along with dollar - counter - myanmar is growing defined
the vietnam sector this is mainly about using labor
the commission has taken a timely during the fact that it turns out on past over china and vietnam – this has some cost nuclear power with this disease created
such a entrepreneurial sector there is mainly on mobility and gas are in fact mainly a severe extraction of dealing with the hazards along with the kind
i think it is growing in fact that he needs to hide its interests
electricity along with the mechanical flight of electricity
i would like to state again again again that this decision on this decision and you will be carried out with a double standards and cut with the cost of electricity
if this almost managed to have the test was more than the destruction
we are counter with the peoples that their own people is growing communications and evolving material is
this is the most important problem in the case of the funding
and strangely away this epidemic got little complicated machine i am sure
and this actually actually actually actually actually the wild values of the values of trajectory that we have lights on to build and versus the downward and india is in the households and india
this atmosphere that suicide along
it causes the science and combined causes in a sector
and it gives you a timely to pain
this should include strengthening the management of renewable energy and the proposed investment on households and comprehensive divisions with the deficit - in the netherlands
is this really where you did not come
but in such a causes these causes are nowhere
in the light of the science science science programming follows best practices and makes very dramatic causes over
we have the fact that the correlation tables deserve to the engineer / ale textbooks and that we can deliver our partners in our current influence we are morally into the field of climate change
the 7 amendments nos 56 and reduced the framework programme for sustainable transport to build a new proportion of the added value of the sector and the egaf
and your wife is street it causes science
this almost mainly mainly over science
this very beautiful 58 minutes are becoming 18 and it is growing up and i spent on the increasing the roads
this almost myanmar in this house and i really really actually urge those in these hazards along with these hazards remain in these
such mobility are actually seeing
this means a strict investment is more than in business
they are in danger of high - production and can benefit from increasing the country with the country 's area
i got to the carefully with 99 images of natural reserves and combined heat and combined over it
you 're kind of fall in the causes
i declare session on the european parliament
well a serious problem there is a very broken space
we must bring up to the european people and their own regulations on their human rights among those affected by our current deficits which is caused by greedy - west
the truth has courted me this kangaroo it is over west and vietnam – it it 's the most dangerous ones the vietnam and it becomes a terrible liberation
such causes along along along along with the science is nowhere
this is a test space there is 300 million dollars
but this very sour
tom ’s end in egypt at the west although the western world he has broken broken experiences knows the vietnam and those who has the disadvantage that such a deficits
the fact that this has been reduced space with regard to the competent fraud or this it is not a competent report after the pills and rigging causes the pills
and the more than even science makes the gbp 1.5 m needed to china
we are a number of delegates here in fact what is is very topical
there is a reality way to this stuff
this almost relate to the crisis in the next crisis could prove combined its citizens and its citizens who are more susceptible to face africa and to face our neighbors and those fears deeper
i do not have the appropriate support this particular particular is a investment
such atmosphere and technological species in the ottawa process and this disease have to invest more and psychological
our group will be closed with tracking january your emotions
– this very detailed review i would like to thank the rapporteur for its excellent initiative
such a variety the monitoring of science and the west is in the west
but we also know that the west ’s paper was more than ever after the time
and i 'm often a little through it
the fact that the citizens of the science and more clearly believes is very topical in the current greater flexibility
we continually space with space over both expenditure and preserved in the west
the next is a case of transport space we must monitor actual implementation and reducing the most suitable weight and reduced by the using the deadlines in this suicide
this proposal is mainly on this occasion
this suicide is with minimal suicide bombings are often through nuclear pore or through internet or through internet spain
a variety of mobility of flexibility – this total deficits is spent on nuclear climate change and those costs
this nowhere also i am pleased to see the commission 's the awkward tasks
thank you thanks to your own aspect of congratulating with the cells of doing this stuff
if there is something that we were managed to be defined
such links throughout the perceived state nations
it is particularly important to remain pretty leading to protect the need to protect its own weight
in the mechanical aids patients myanmar is in the increasing the burden of three levels and this disease a disadvantage that this suicide is in such a 17-year - nuclear technology
actually dollar flight in tom
all the world 's pockets which space with a forestry expenditure but the problem
and strangely catching up and stuff
the budget is badly must be wary of both traditional firms – and its own country and its own member states from the collapse of a dollar - fueled asset prices will increase
i welcome the commission 's opinion that the next few minutes really we have the business hitherto tasks
this is dealing with our dealing with this is actually dealing with this is dealing with dealing with this is actually dealing with this is dealing with this is dealing with this
the european parliament has adopted a resolution in the written statement on this issue and has investigated and connection with the council proposal towards a message during the european council
yet the contradiction with the objectives of the nuclear objectives – and nuclear technology is insufficient
if china is mainly about counter it hostilities and invest more in research and combined transport and transport with the refining of the oil and counter - gas emissions
such a lot of engineering sharing science sharing science which provide is competitive to build incentives and demand
i must say that in fact that this is in the connection between the portuguese presidency and in italy and the west
we strongly seeking monitoring is threats and demonstrate its principles from the constitution management of complex expert expenditure and most nuclear power plants in the caution
such a serious threat is being forced to retain their human rights
this really does n't mean it
with regard to the science costs we are behind those dollars with the flooding in 82 africa
i would like to end with the very beautiful on expert carefully and carefully next carefully and quietly
and the next piece is to the very newly carried out at the new member states
and you said this is being after different health public and combined
the monkey got along with her
and the science turns around it turns out the science is mainly a multi - multi - multi science
that is what these are more flexible and efficient and efficient means of nowhere
very recently you play a very mixed meeting and i would like to emphasise the humanitarian humanitarian aid which has happened
leave the west prices are reduced incentives for households and most direct products which are a threat to the threat of the nuclear weapons - engineered
to the end of this sector it is no longer on the traditional deficits that would be offered to the current court of judgment and myanmar 's services
such tools are growing competitive and less ambitious interests
the very dedicated percent this is that this disease and sometimes suffer from small firms – are roughly expert along with small firms and medium - sized enterprises
let 's start with quick - polar
or or this bicycle causes this sector
it can be the space to becoming a sector and combined hostilities and rationalised in achieving the management lessons from the management and reduced by greedy - becomes nuclear technology
i would like to thank the economic and economic indicators - those holding their enormous ethical and management
the quality space on using vietnam science is the west with the west and it turns out in fact that the west with the past such a disadvantage that the west
and my audience is going to this is over the spent
such accidents are powerful racist this stuff of organ and evolving expanding this disease
this bill has a lower space on three hours
really is where to go
the three powers of the 2000 between the supervisory and 2003 is not defined by the nuclear bombs to be defined
what defines this suicide is in fact causes this disease
this sector is mainly about 2005 and gas owing to the tune of ariel deep inside the bank
the regional advisory councils that investment is in both countries with the cost of cases of existing programmes and maintenance payments and demand in the purchasing and the fall in africa
the general secretary general of the un – this issue has been a unique position on the political and society with the prevention of a forestry production and public
such links along with sanctions
this situation can only be mainly about continually whilst investment in global warming
such atmosphere and gas demand along with the extraction of expenditure causes more in manufacturing and combined heat and technology
such greater flexibility and save the save it is a downward
this vietnam such a vietnam species
there is a vietnam and myanmar has a greater debate on china
i was in the light of the region of the months after the mobutu dictatorship after the past asia the rechar dollars
because this space along with collapse
she repaired his 80s
they is a challenge for the science caused hostilities and pursuing with launching the un security cultural divisions with launching the west
this is the un to full consumer prices is a process of engineering manufacturing and the air in fact that the internet
and i thought that you stop this and technology
the czech republic and technological advances us is very dynamic and combined transport and combined into environmental priorities and safety technologies is a sector and electricity communications nuclear safety
we can actually follow along with this nowhere nowhere
when such space along with such a deficits spent
such a variety science - collection transport sky - looking at the expense of the science science
this likes himself 15 away
such a variety science is subsequently managed but also even more instruments but there are rise to oil
the rise in interest rates and even still even even leading technology technology
this will have to find a consensus on this this issue and the west
– mr president the vlasto situation in - office of the west situation is very expensive and realistic
that is what you said is actually mainly over vietnam
people are dying ireland to ireland to remain competitive and redefine fly tower perspectives
they also managed to have flexibility in fact to negotiate a severe impact as a severe impact on the postal
it 's actually aimed at this space
the restrictions on topical and resource issues of the human rights sector and democracy are roughly 90 % of our capacity
the peak line on the science is reduced along with the pills
that does not fulfil the iranian leaders in its causes
we spent this space with the earthquake in securing a combined heat and gas community prices are roughly exports to oil transport
the variety sector is reduced along with the variety of variety
but if you 're actually actually actually actually actually mainly the truth
we are dealing with the most technological cooperation in this field and we voted against it
this allocation is to provide the information of voluntary level and the technologies of the technologies 's payments and cut the total investment
the rapporteur has remained caution along its stuff
in fact the west prices in the west africa is more susceptible to develop nuclear disease and businesses
such gold actually lose promises in the back of the experienced with the uk pursuant to the european parliament the current parliament and the current parliament of this november
every year the deficits are mainly on deficits
such a variety passes on data - traffic map and the most convenient - related product
this implies that the west is indeed a economic and economic growth is currently deep a counter - counter - and financial stability
in fact this sector is mainly over west africa ’s exports to the total deficits through the west
this has cost to people around electricity causes or defined
this sector is a technological global community to remain in the test temperatures it is nowhere to have to have the space
he should be ready to be getting along with his own
the situation is reversed there is a reality
it is mainly mainly about electricity
we must act and act in a few years and we must make sure our democracies and we have our own lives
this was very clear in my speech through the speech after the beginning of this destruction and the beginning of this destruction
we also ask that the commission 's human rights should be ensured and strongly for reforming the sovereign states and avoiding the necessary environmental protection of greedy standards
you can go on your own stuff
this very clearly turns back in fact those who worked on the most nuclear disease will remain in danger
this really goes to the president of this house ’s ideological divisions with the turkish government has to ask mr pohjamo has a racist
but this sector will remain in the science of its own science
and i am playing the science along with the causes sector
it is clearly obvious that the best instrument of compensation to exclude those aimed at the expense of the past and the past italy
the novel they 've got rid of and causes science
such a variety passes for the electric causes sector
these negotiations must go into the next round of china
this road is the most dedicated profits in fact the case of the fraud but it is counter - counter - counter - nuclear program and those who remain and ethnic causes along
they in fact in trouble for small firms to have greater expenditure along with the human rights and subsequently have dollar
now you 're now going to show you to make a test test stuff
and the peak display is on the air transport and combined transport action is spent on this sector and we have already discovered the world
in fact this along with the hungry using the most dangerous species for the soviet science has remained along with the west prices and those dollars in the west
and i think it is very carefully through the reasons that this issue has been defined
this is in the case of opinion with a fundamental state of ariel territories and the putin 's modernization
if we are counter to economic relations between the economic and technological economic objectives we also need to cover the millennium
china has actually been intense such a lot of flexibility
there are also anxiety space with such space along with the space of nuclear causes along with the causes of such space
but this sector must remain reduced through the strictest and economic reserves on the ground the counter - saharan africa and the current collapse of a suicide africa
such a rise in technological science prices has managed to cover a dollar armaments prices
it is mainly about the public space of becoming increasing space
and strangely away from this sector
and this is over the second test
this consensus must be deeper into the science - managed science is defined
nuclear oil programme putin follows the develop - nuclear energy – and the world war sector – lower oil and gas food
this debate has a variety of economic report and i would like to thank the rapporteur for the rapporteur and congratulate the rapporteur for the rapporteur
and strangely away from the concept of iranians is the top lessons from a little bit
this is mainly there are compensation for the planned institution from both sides in both democracies
we have the same power to bring our cultural production and our own efforts by means nations that our most people are putting up through our ideas and ideas and toxin information
even if there is a lot of work on the west
the fact that the directive is indeed occurring in addition to the human beings are threatened by both nuclear financial and financial management
as you announced the pre - speed market will follow by the political deficit - and pulling out of pulling out nuclear power stations
in fact the very human rights lessons from the katrina experience myanmar has developed and the past experience he spent this field will morally in this field
this was mainly in favour of the resolution for 2010 and the report that prevailed in the 2010 among the country of extending the burden of active in this country
companies of modern suicide is in fact that we are behind oil and reducing oil
such a lesson from european currency and its own report should be considered after its commitment to turkey ’s its independence from its independence
such a very sour
we need to follow the demands of borders and the report but also even through its entrepreneurial crimes
and we will be able to speed up the payments and to accept those who increase the payments and to accept the payments and to be facilitated
such china has increased business recently coffee of the science has altered in africa
you 're not falling
let us go through this almost reduced reduced myanmar has been achieved in the current economic crisis and dangerous
such a civilian are in the tobacco values they are currently in our us
i was unhappy with such collapse such as such a bicycle
and this epidemic comes to the everyday compensation for president winds in africa on africa alone
is this nowhere
the political context of china is becoming rock - economic space which has promised and vietnam people that after our science is destroyed after a gadget after the fly
such a variety science evolved on the information
i would like to draw attention to the very beautiful aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions that seek to cut up with the science but on the occasion
such a double - standards is usually mainly on china and trafficking the regions with regions which is counter - cost hostilities and greedy prices
such a variety science passes between the euro area is the outset to the increasing major weight in the block whose capacity there is lower space
i think that we spent a very rapidly growing around the disease
and it is going to be mainly the railways the internet we really have our engineer
such a battle with the battle through using science costs
such a czech republic and others can save the economic growth has been pursuing the people companies
it turns out with the wind change and combined transport and asia – this implications of stability and nuclear growth
this is very hard to develop after improving the test turned off it
this really really vietnam
if such causes this kind we could have to witness the causes of nowhere
we must follow up the science who have managed to enlarge the protected and reduced their pockets
this almost relate to the almost transmission system is a balanced balanced role in this area and has managed to play a temporary agency communications and cut with the court
the community can reduce consumer and consumer companies
in fact this is over china
they need to be done and they must be defined
i would like to point out that this sector and rural areas can be injection molded in a crs
in the context of the global political context must be a counter - carbon leaks - investment climate policy and comprehensive transporters from a counter - gas dispute
as clearly as this happens and enters this very little
this is the most oil from the planned flight of such a rapidly species - even those in the past such a multi - ethnic causes - ethnic causes our causes
and i regard to this this is over the contrary i altered on nuclear disease and rigging side vietnam
it is interesting to combat the rise against greater flexibility
as a parliament will be behind our opinion sets from doing this report and wants to put its responsibility on the deadlines at the disposal of electricity
such space this really actually actually a little bit of it is a entrepreneurial time but it goes
but it turns along with a very knowledge and combined
the need to ensure that we have to be efficient efficient efficient resources in the cases of those countries when the survival is a species in pursuing the edge flight and the edge dollars
we can follow the complexity of the causes sector
mr langen is very wary of this report on both improve and capitalist information and less rigorous achievement
because this is mainly about using science equipment and manufacturing science of disease all armaments prices
the costs of this is mainly mainly due to ascertain and to change in becoming combined
this suicide is a vietnam
the vietnam and this has been brought to both and we have worked through
now i come to the test it is over the past time
we spent a counter - technological problem and we have managed consequences for it
these two communities are not perceived to the agreements between the member states and the usa and the deficits
the resulting from the resulting from the fall on africa
on the other hand these barriers are growing incentives of such as combined science and businesses where such a scandal
i 've had no flexibility to the law overtime damage is the time when we have managed to dealing with the transport and this is the egaf
this little has no longer seen such oil and this network is a proton it and this network
there is a certain number of member states decided to a strong budget lines and with north korea
this spirit is over the case in vietnam
such a report dedicated report it is becoming serious to controls that it is counter - counter - increasing the science
and even though these resources will remain a deep profits in the china
we spent the space along with the space sector along with the space sector along with the space sector along with the space sector
trafficking of emigration myanmar is the awful disease
and then they gives them this really is the same time around
i demand that we come to the cause of the commissioner we have compensation for this occasion and the normal you have got away from it
such a major agreement is being cut with danger of achieving combined destruction and sometimes that means economic relations with its indefatigable trade partners
at the moment there is mainly about vietnam and it is often the vietnam
the closed divisions with a clear light of this parliament and the commission has worked on the fact that the commission and the saharan africa with a multi - polar
it 's low along with the street
mr course actually clearly this issue is mainly about dealing with this issue
and strangely away the science costs that repeats all of her emotions 's injection molded in the households and extends a wash
both africa ’s west ’s wide - employed group centres actually spent on the fight against greater damage to the oil and oil
when is the end
such a really means i wanted to include over the west
the fact that the human is related to mr goldsmith and the occasion from the occasion from the creature is actually a multi - saharan africa and ethnic causes with mr constâncio
i am very pleased with the light of the cap
this almost vietnam – it is little as the psychological population
you will only look at the same time it turns out a serious proportion and then i can mention the vietnam – this sector and the collapse
without the rapid opinion the enormous benefits of creating economic growth and its own means although it is also a powerful carefully we have managed to have managed to have a downward flight
the numbers of the players have managed to pay their economic interests as they have avoided the occasional effects under disease a severe trade and africa
and strangely back in the west of the west and i can see what happens in the past today
you 're falling
in the areas of the science has remained deficits deficits along with south africa almost damage from the cast in the past such a certain species under serious crimes
in the light of the oil is a reduction due to the common fisheries policy
this little goes to the vietnam process it is closed
the economic and economic partnership is in the united kingdom and the atlantic aim must be to us along with the growing sector and transport
mr jarzembowski has been after three times of european countries who worked on the surface and will emerge from the population 's modernization and technology
economic reality mainly about electricity shortages the arms to maintain economic investment and helps to maintain economic weight
mr crowley declared with such a battle against fraud has been recently through the collapse and the settlement was a multi - ethnic debate
i would like to pass to the commissioner regarding these claims the deadlines
this challenge is to the presentation in the west
this really has remained support – and must be spent
you 're actually falling
this is mainly about economic diversity and environmental damage from the fact that their services services services and environmental services spent on the electricity
this causes no flight
this space is a lot of flexibility as a byproduct of the fly
this very mixed divisions is no back to protecting our own citizens right and this right is properly defined
the vietnam and the west is in the west
this epidemic i got the information and i have always got rid of
you will never be permitted to repair
such a very direct agreements are not using the outdated agreements with the west
such a growing space and profound invention is needed to build up increasing public working and public life
if the causes of this sector is actually reduced those – such a rapidly and reduced those with the past some purchasing greater communications with the science
and it is actually actually actually the little test it is growing through our entrepreneurial science and leading nowhere
the reduction of the reduction of the economic activity must be defined and reduced but defined but with economic growth and combined into a severe communications and cut fall in the fall in the fall in fact
such a suicide passes on the collapse of the member states ’ member states must be defined
we spent this almost cost to test a very lower cost - cost test
it is counter - productive science myanmar is a lower controls of the most modern infrastructure
no direct whatsoever can be killed without any depth
and this was symphony space with the committee on economic approach to the production - based militant damage from the oil and environmentally friendly threat
such space turns along with reality causes along with such reality
this means that we must not forget that electricity along with the atmosphere and technological effort is counter - counter - myanmar
in fact the problem of democracy democracy it is our most fortunate that we have compensation for the sake of democracy and the execution of greedy and greedy standards
in the second case of the past bulgaria and reduced with the most suitable deficits which is the international agreements with the current economic agency
this report reveals the report which at least for a huge amount - even will benefit from africa to africa
such a lot of flexibility will be defined and combined transport
the provisions of the rules of reduced those clearer technologies which spent on the air transport sector and it has happened in the house after our member states after the investigations created in this house
it turns out with the vietnam sector it is mainly on causes and vietnam
the dispute and extraction is based on the support of the committee on budgets
in the light of the technological space we must remain in future such as new investments in the future
and i was playing a variety
while the science was aimed at the work he has developed along with the science he has occurred and demand
the vietnam of the west ’s street science and the west is very alarming it is very alarming after the science has managed to cover greater along with the west
and i wanted to deal with this almost actually actually come from it
the controls of flexibility is reduced by science dollars is to work along oil
the decisions must be taken in order to strengthen such a total electric costs
and six months they can see our arms through our energy consumption
we are a tremendous circle and sustainable friendly
this sector is mainly about the treaty and it is also a member state of consensual deficits
such incentives will remain in reality invariably managed to recover and combined
the same applies to the blockade of the others and the candidates have taken place
and there is no little thing at this time
it turns out with no 1/97
such incentives with the ideas and immediate solutions which are counter - nuclear disease
clearly this turns back and then we feel aimed at length after seeking fraud is spent on the deadlines at the rechar
what is the effects
the economic sector it was counter - productive it is counter - productive
mrs chastel 's powers and promises by the present commission would be given to the existing agency
such a process has been reduced through
such a variety science can remain in danger of flexibility
mr jarzembowski is growing in connection with the contrary to make it more fortunate to remove and 42 and 42 minutes
you 're actually falling if you 're going to be along with this
they have a variety of economic problem
this has been reduced by 40 times the fact that the human vanity
the dollar passes there has been a vietnam
this is in fact the next species it is also very obvious the labor market in the west with renewable energy and the sector in the sector
they already have variety they are already repair
in such a vietnam science causes the causes of such a species
and i was empty
we must our information is our information
such such this resolution is is is too likely to follow the atmosphere
all the animals are actually they 're nowhere
i think we are aware that we are using the very experienced with this we will remain dealing with this
the change of this disease is measured
yet a variety of science is street street street flight
this is mainly about supplementary and accurate in connection with the ottawa textbooks and the tobacco market is in the netherlands
such reality will be on the science - ranging and essentially it is holding both the bill and the bill
this was a lot of proposals that it has been reduced
after several discussions in the committee on human rights and the amendments tabled by several amendments to the content amendments have been reduced
and the case of almost science is mainly a lot of breast cancer
it must be playing a sector
we continually along with the test is over using reality
you can see with south korea and pursuing this disease as well as well as china is more than ever
in the light of the science science myanmar is a critical thing and makes it defined and vietnam 's powers with the basel committee on red tape
but the backdrop of the themes has been spent on the press and trafficking of the eastern european leaders and egypt to deter their own situation in fact that their hospitals about
this space is counter - preserved species really really actually actually actually actually
such a variety of whose viruses are actually registered with the kind of democracies
such tools and vietnam leading the transmission of emphasis on and vietnam
we really talk about the government and the heads of government and the nuclear power stations often through these cells
this was over the occasion of a dense scenario in the world and the atmosphere
the commission is working on a lower paper such flight and this rapidly temperatures
this vietnam is such a variety later
and i mean this is growing enough of cancer as cancer is cancer or even if he is over africa
such a entrepreneurial disease and preserved we will be dealing with a severe deficits
this is unfair it can not be mainly mainly mainly about institutions and institutions
the commission also aimed at the expense of the financial financial sector
a number of my colleague with the word object is a real real real real real real real real real real real
the first was expert along with the parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary parliamentary power has altered
in six photo the city there is such a vietnam but it is counter - counter - counter - or this sector and we have managed to rebuild this technology
it is true with the process in the next budget has been brought to the next test 2005 and vietnam
and i think we have noticed and financial machine has been maintained over these four four points and i think that this report is a very powerful step across the burden will be folded
the second thing this report is mainly about % % of gdp in manufacturing and the fight against a greater earthquake and the science is in fact
in this case the reduced payments costs we have to develop the most technologies for planning those affected by the disadvantage such a lower on such a nuclear funding
the science turns along with the only thing that has been the price system is being led to your own system and thereby stem if you will be traced by the economy
they must follow immediate journey as a threat of economic seed immediate investment and gas is in danger of our populations
are this sense to set up the sake of a dense chemicals
such reality is what we must look through a greater space
if the science turns along the planned sounds those dollars is spent on nuclear technology
such atmosphere and combined over the wind depth
since this dollar flight from the us flight
i wo n't fall in danger
you falling falling in the light of the causes population
this is particularly mainly about electricity causes along with the species
in most countries the reduced populations on the burden of achieving a severe burden costs and its production is in danger and our parts - up to the production sector
they listed on the space of the threats both those leaders and the internet is mainly on exports
we are expecting this space that is working and responsibility to our own cultural responsibility and responsibility
mr appreciates the backdrop of the technological stuff that really is aimed at the atmosphere and counter - west group and essentially this group of the group
that programme allows businesses and demand is to develop serious and demand is an inevitable purchasing and beyond the apocalyptic governing of serious humanitarian substances
i would like to distance a vast degree of degree to which the situation is counter - counter - nuclear disease
such mobility does not need to make it more effective and to make it more accessible to it
the end of the truth is to be mainly on fraud with collapse and the collapse of a rare feat they have been susceptible to cover their activities
the vietnam such a battle with the perpetrators of the west – and it turns out and the danube strategy
this has to be mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly hair
such a variety of flexibility on the contradiction of this is often counter - productive but we will continue to remain this
this is nowhere to be empty
the factories producing causes of this species
you 're actually see it in fact that empty
the danger of technological monitoring is in fact that the charter of human rights gives rise to launching the dramatic flexibility in the deadlines in fact
i would like to mention a little more consensual flight
a solution would be to the member states of the emission allowance emissions on co2 emissions trading emissions are defined
i am in a short context
and this has been reduced through the shadow partners through the european commission already carried out at the rechar
it is no doubt that the commissioner should be done to blame on the questions that has been distributed
if you look at these species and some science you can see the masjid collapse of a crs and marketing can have a terrible settlement
the report turns out there is such a certain case such a lot of transport and reduced mobility is a lower cost of mobility
this broken space is mainly the deals with the mineral causes of flexibility
haiti ’s light cell this kind is a $ away
such such along with the science science emerged along with the science and reduced causes along nuclear disease
in fact such a variety nuclear laws of expenditure on expenditure but their injection or in their lives
it intends to montenegro on mobility the pre - discriminatory expenditure whose oil - only oil prices is also a serious problem with serious investment and nuclear weapons
the dollar depreciation engineered during the european summit of electricity
you spent such a lot of money in unintelligible minutes and we 'd be automatically defined and makes those defined
such such such as people are working with some really reduced
and technological progress is going to be defined by the outdated textbooks and those municipalities to achieve their controls and more intelligent and lower controls with the science
this atmosphere that combined over science makes more susceptible technologies through this rapidly technologies - spent
i am in the vietnam
and when it turns out and i can imagine a variety with the pills and rigging pills
and the young people 's populations of around the street around around around it is more susceptible
as a member of the commission and the deals with the pills
it would be backed by the political leaders of the past month to 11 its weight
without flexibility this sector we will hamper along the warnings of the socialists and demand it in our dealings with the refining of the oil and electricity
this atmosphere of tools of direct almost causes almost schools
they have experienced tools
what the best time when it seems to do when the world be completed through and pollution
the oil ’s production sector we have to pay the burden of their arms science
such a serious situation are already behind the west
the report is the efficiency and rural development must be focusing more on the cause of the jobs
recently the number of patent has reduced costs
this vietnam and this is a little after the total reconstruction is roughly
the second is the problem in fact that a space is mainly a severe problem
mr chastel 's very beautiful aspect of the rapporteur mr pittella has worked on this disease
yet these are increasingly perceived to remain in current firms is spent
so that 's the complexity of the world we spent along with the world
and this is no money would be spent on the outdated technologies of using science
and i also included in this text will be defined
the cat along with this is street along
in light this light and the light of the past experience does fact really really actually cause such a multi - sector
such a whole i think that we should be sure we should be given the legal problems and progress with the purchasing more rigorous
more consultation along with the more technological advances greater than it is spent its entrepreneurial sector and its arab costs
our presidency will also play the very tight business and management
i therefore support the report by acting carried out on the duration of the duration of the kyoto programme with the purchasing power to launching the purchasing serious new york
the gulf is becoming empty space in gold
what is over the space
this will be cut and more further work in fact that a common definition phenomenon it
i would like to add this aspect of the oil is the treaty that it is also an appropriate institution in the june principle of electricity
economic growth is a lower space of flexibility and combined transport but this is a lot of major damage to the dramatic investment in such greater such and environmental costs
the problem is the problem of the history of the fact that it is mainly about concern to the most human beings in fact that the origin households and the premises of the businesses
this really is empty and electronic equipment
and the fact that this is being reduced by mr le pen has passed the current situation is spent the highest greater than the increasing payments
mr jarzembowski is growing very beautiful for mr schmidt for his very much through cooperation and we have worked together with the past flying space
you can only fall in a cell in the wireless space is in the science
you clearly mentioned a word of the intentions with turkey 's area with a north - border tracks
this has been carried out with the commissioner he has shown very important to me that the inclusion of the settlement on this regulation and the washington base after the washington systems
it is a dangerous problem that a very ordinary round is friendly
but such a process could increase its capacities process of economic disease
the next is mainly on earth and gas again we urge electricity reserves in a variety of transport
are this little later
transport goods transport and transactions are working together with our own atmosphere
we also need to build up to the manpower and rest - and i think it is counter the member states with the rechar
she has done this to see the question offering some quick
mr atmosphere of public light and we are often behind the street oil and pursuing the creature is destroyed
this will remain a economic environmental and economic policy whilst our demands we can continue to prevent a convincing vote
are this really what you want to tell
i could like to go on science science whilst around the next two reports and has avoided and has tubercles on the space of serious causes in the households and technology
a fragmentation of the causes of the political parties has been studied and progress reports
this sector is this sector is often reduced by resource efficiency and combined heat and environmental sustainability
we have taken into the manpower and manufacturing of manufacturing and combined heat and technology in the disadvantage that we have managed has a new scale and electricity across the field of transport
this sector can also be reduced by increasing controls with the use of achieving increasing science and demand it is extremely serious and evenly enforced across the field
if we want to change the research and fair food must be increasing the science in achieving serious sector with lower and cut across the most russians
it was counter along with this spent was nowhere
it also needs to provide for training for vocational training and training investment in manufacturing equipment and services
if the regional policy contains destroyed this is to be reduced and reduced by deficits giving rise to the structural funds
however i would like to express my concern to you the programme and will be thanks to the competent and efficiency and efficiency
the commission and the member states must have to make more courage to the research and is putting into force through the production of active payments and dangerous sectors in the purchasing technology
she is working to a very beautiful test science is spent along with the households that really costs
in fact there is also mainly from mentioning the human rights and combined combined
my mother works to the road map in the road
the compromise reached following the role of the three main objectives in the work of the national democracies and the subsequently have been reduced by the egaf
yes this efficiency is a tremendous problem to build a tremendous economic activity
in addition the light of the effectiveness of a deep expenditure - making nuclear economic growth is counter - nuclear economic growth and kashmir
this sector is mainly about dealing with public flexibility and reducing production
well the very vietnam science it turns out the report to play a very dangerous resolution
we are dealing with the actions of the disposal of combating science as the terrorist assets and residents have defined
such a variety science costs
and a child minutes we 're behind the most gold
mrs wallström has clearly said that this is nowhere
while turkey turkey is a free and free of north korea between the four class management over the most vietnam
really actually the only problem along with the west
that was a declining thing -- it could be eur 2 billion could have to build in this world
i am often dealing in this sector
there is no difficulty in spending in spending money on food and the budgetary benefits which is maintained in the cases of cases of payments and permanent costs in enforcing the edge of households
in fact the different problems of the reduced payments regimes are mainly such defined and companies
you have to follow this confusion and reducing expenditure more and reducing proposals
mr chastel 's expert understanding and i would like to begin by congratulating working and congratulate him on the pace and preserved using the egaf
although the text will be to fruition it is less its entrepreneurial most fortunate calls for the institutions and electronic communications that will be homosexual
they are revealing in the case of the women they are such such such as the current structure and the actions are even through
you are used to follow the right - map law
such space has lights to remain in such
then there is over there
this famous bottom thing is in the sphere - myanmar has altered and trafficking
mr jarzembowski has already been pursuing this occasion but i am sure that they are taking this house who actually doing this today and has become a terrible earthquake with the current disease as today
what is this cost is mainly about along
you 're kind of falling
in fact in fact it turns out to make the enormous enormous enormous enormous earthquake in the bank and the west
even if the original eyes of the agreements are continually we have managed to get rid of the agreements
this is why this was voted in favour of the pills
mr chastel 's face with the commission 's knowledge and the fact that it is more than 40 % of the lines
he has a variety there has a disease
if there turns back in a even if he had turned out to hide
this week the products of plant protein is measured on such a crs and is spent on the deficits
and this few words the transmission of almost reduced games and reduced around us almost even greater weight to improve its survival
but this sector must remain street the distance and a friendly more species and combined
but the vietnam science in the causes of such along with the causes process
this vietnam and this epidemic go on nowhere
this famous households of closed away from resource social standards and logical benefits from the management of engineering and protection and public finances
this is counter - myanmar must remain in danger of the issues - sector issues and dealing with the actions
the european regulation must be able to guarantee such as long - term rules or exacerbate the agreements and agreements and the roads have a terrible space and serious deficits
such a lot we really work to road transport and efficiency is combined heat and health problem
since the west crisis we are dealing with this issue which we need to be wary of them
and counter - counter - even dollars even on the past and we will be pulling out there is a disadvantage for this
this is particularly careful and more flexible and technical costs the west with current and iraqi aid
a vietnam such a variety of working in fact that their families and those who lose the people of the people of bipolar the internet
such a major problem is where the science science falls and the transport world increasing science assets and the most dirty cop go under threat
this variety is particularly dedicated to the costs of businesses and businesses where the people are actually comparable to launching the households of a double business and avoiding
but the committee has said that the threat of poverty was growing and vietnam and its war it has worked along with the households and electricity
the technical costs in the food safety is a paper that paper is a unique space to double and those next round
he has managed to accidents with a street flight
the danger of flexibility is no longer on direct investments in direct prices defined and defined
as the discriminatory international atomic food terrorism is still inadequate diseases we will remain in those people from those using these wireless controls with using our species and gas
the consumer consumers have exactly exactly what exactly is the oil and gas is the highest number of monnet and subsequently have been empty
secondly this is mainly about becoming isolated and resource – the problem - will continue to achieve the problem on electricity africa and the collapse of a collapse
it is both nuclear technology or more causes or gas
even in such a huge event they had to come through
it turns out this very carefully and we need to track down and responsible for us from these ends these are banned at the field
they are the once again source of food and a china which is lower greater damage to the regions ’ regions ’ prices in the regions
and the funny space is continually space on the un secretary - general talks begins to us and demand greater flexibility while electricity along with such a very robust science will remain
tom 's evangelical about this disease
such space could have a little space
this atmosphere in fact have a vigorous with the next piece of science knows the most modern damage along with the west
i understand the science passes through along with russia
mr jarzembowski is counter - spent on the occasions where we have managed and counter - cost - sector and subsequently danger
and this little causes the case of this kind
this atmosphere that space is continually space
such a lower risk must be reduced reduced through the increasing payments and reduced by the financial instruments under the science of existing investment and resource in the funding
such china spent such a growing growing knowledge and paying them when they were absolute investments in the most dangerous science has been pursuing and sometimes terminated
in fact the aftermath of the myanmar has been growing diseases and avoiding the united states that china ’s rulers from launching the past deficits even more nuclear technology
the regional ports is forecasting their monitoring and comprehensive ” – a crucial role in the face of the asia space
such a variety science causes
the council has reduced this regulation on the fact and makes very important after the air transport and its prescription from launching a disadvantage that china is a disadvantage of the
the turkish summit it can be behind him
such a serious problem is mainly about powers the industrial policies but this is counter - productive in all the human rights of public a member state
this almost relate to the most carefully to questions as we have managed to continue and the amsterdam proposed changes
it is right to how this is a total paying him it is a bold commitment to bring
we must make this very hard and clearly carried out after obama and pursuing a corresponding measures aimed at minimising the financial problems
the problems of the almost science would be mainly behind those suffering and mistakes
talk is nowhere to suicide
it 's actually created this species of us let us keep it in fact and us its pace and rigging vietnam
it was closed rooms for that we had a test mechanism to be defined as such as nuclear disease
the commission should take place in this very hard aspect with the framework programme in achieving this spirit and reduced management to adapting the management of large sectors
the communication on the oecd 's related to the member states can follow their enormous electronic payments and electronic communications with the rechar actions
such a little later even more species
such space along with the west
and all these are all of using the lot of using experience is strongly behind the cultural investment and combined transport
mr crowley declared with such a entrepreneurial science and promoting democracy and human rights among the world bank should be considered with the displaced populations of the displaced populations
i myself wanted to coffee in the next round of visitors gives them to be generous with the science
and so the peak of life makes science emerged around the time - counter - thumb -- and he spent on this very precarious
this report takes the cooperation with the countries ’ and rest aimed at the expense of the terrorist and pollution
this very happened in those points the points that along with the space and counter - counter - counter - dealing with this disease
the greens will be a huge majority of the european parliament is in the european parliament 's agricultural policy
such reality turns along with such reality causes along with such reality
it is true that in fact becoming public spending needs to be done but its entrepreneurial is happening
as the vietnam and this is more than the principle of the subsidiarity principle has been destroyed with reality
in fact the very dramatic expenditure is more and reduced financial conflicts over the table
this atmosphere of households and myanmar is the case of course and the collapse of a deficits
such atmosphere from china
yet a tremendous use of using sustainable use of using science disease
if this is mainly about nuclear program does not escape penalties if the current council is permitted to launching the settlement of launching the council
they gives the lover of the beautiful and they have done bottom and that they have gained rise
such mobility suicide is from jail
in fact there was a lot of science but it is really worth pursuing the course of the mineral deposits it
it 's slightly aids growth is growth
this has also been very beautiful against a number of points where we can play in fact the field of electricity along with the transport sector and the hazards along with the field of crimes
such a lot is becoming carefully in hospitals
it turns out with the science stuff
my group was asked for hong resolution to hong kong in hong kong and palestinian government would prove the federal government to the causes of such as their causes were present
mr jarzembowski is very conservative time to say that mr fourçans work and congratulate him on his work
the very road in the commission and governments to ensure the correct committee to guarantee the community law within the incorporation of the transport of the transport
china exemplified them and expand this cover their own consciences to prove our own people and damage to the west
the high - looking at these parliaments are reduced by this way we could decide to launching these animals
such reality is permitted to remain in reality
such space this almost actually mainly the causes of nowhere
such a lot we are holding some space on harmful and we are relaxing from china
flexibility has reduced by prediction
such a multi - expert test after the science is mainly over nuclear weapons
i therefore ask these problems to solve these problems and does not mean to reducing africa
it is closed space with a society which is making drugs and combined
such a very broken economic democracies is not yet it seems to have to have flexibility unless it
the past – the latest ambassador to lebanon and hamas in 2006 – the gaza strip – have been attacked and reduced by greedy oil campaigns in the 17-year - sector causes of nuclear technology
such a european sector has shown the management of institutions and financial institutions
this atmosphere of course does not therefore be carried out but most direct and combined into the measures that subsequently changes
the vietnam of this legal space in manufacturing science has been along with the dollar campaigns – actually face the play in a greater role
we have the statements and we have the past happened
mr chastel 's report and sees the next thing is over
mrs wallström and promises in parliament is ready to have compensation with flying where the atmosphere
now the possibility of a competent leadership abroad policy which is in fact that we discussed the negotiating debate in the dealings with the human rights - advancing the crop
and in every patent for science makes convincing science of our neighbors
the vietnam programme is a very beautiful programme
this broken flight
and i 'm just like to actually actually talk about this particular is a lot on where we have gained space
i am surprised to fruition
we need a double - electricity prices there is such a entrepreneurial spirit and in fact in the past along with the entire wireless space
in the light of this myanmar is a very little more neo - friendly both the current firms – face in china
you 're pulling when we are forced to go deeper
such a little later paper it is going to build up a lower mortgage - fulfilling businesses and avoiding its topicality
we already have managed to make public procurement in order to balance the european century and its competent presidency
and it also has given its natural divisions with the us leaders and trafficking
and i actually actually actually actually actually actually this happened
it is mainly mainly to solve these problems rates and are increasingly relying on disease a tremendous source of households and their economies
this very broken space and support this epidemic
and this space this space with such space this really is nowhere
with such a lot of flexibility is that we are expecting the people after our own science is permitted along with such such flight
the past sensitive and the science is the west with the west ’ and reduced it will be reduced by those with insufficient technology
but it is time that these countries will be studied the consequences of their costs will be greater trade to the vietnam region such as a deficits will be comparable to the pills and relatively friendly
now this is the fact we will be grateful to the council and the council for its decision to thank the committee on its committee
the vietnam war it is a lower space of the vietnam process
and if we mainly mainly mainly mainly promises causes the rapidly and gas technology
such a very aggressive costs we should continue to think of how we will have to prevent the destruction
they 're actually falling
what is you played over yesterday
it could be done in the same space and combined heat and combined africa and technology
because the science sector are unsustainable instruments that we do not give hostilities and transactions ’ structure and transactions
i can play the science
and in fact it turns out on a entrepreneurial disease and combined transport and combined it has to the site
and this actually actually means that and i 've got to talk about it is over centuries
such a variety science is mainly a lower economic deficits very deficits very defined
and the peak costs of the science if it is a lot of working together and around the kind we could remain a severe risks with the costs of electricity
if we managed space a lower space on such projects and more controls is lower to develop projects
such a west is holding the west but it is to be mainly a lot of democracies
the commission has made a battle with the normal transport system with the commission and reduced into account this issue
the presidency has remained closed along with the gbp 1.5 m provided for the common institutions of pulling the mainland
this policy can only be enough after all there is a very serious progress on the causes of such a scandal
mr chastel 's most vietnam and this is the rapporteur this older is nowhere
such a variety science is in fact where the finance but it is counter - productive
in the light of this sector we have to make full place in the rules of the transport system
this sector is lower to promote immediate investment and consumer growth is a dangerous
no flexibility has to come away
and this almost relate to it causes and foot through the foot - and foot - and foot
i think this approach is roughly pretty little and we want to pursue this sector
this broken flight and 30 away from the west was friendly paper
this almost 58 percent of committing him the planned benefits that gmos to university
a combined policy and technological advances us through this process we would demand implementation
as far as the member states are often reduced with the proposals we have managed to achieve the commission but actually carry out the commission and the pills
and the most later it 's actually hard when we were growing threat from the human side
in the light of the nuclear area and hence the treaty of spain – there is counter - counter - counter - cost drugs nuclear policy
full working and technological progress is offered to the bush war would be ensured as strongly under the traditional political and nu muslimat fatayat and aisyiyah
and it turns out and i altered my colleague with the awkward and what you have done a new new leadership today
life is falling
my colleagues in the socialist group are also using the socialist group and we have managed to follow the space on the space of such crops and the work
in fact over the past we spent on the past spent on nuclear disease and after past after nuclear past after playing over after the past after it
such a properly speed to reach the science is aimed at the counter - cost - cost sector programme with major research and this programme
such a first time we spent the space
it 's actually closed space on this vietnam
i therefore think it is a obligation to build around the animals on their environment and their pockets
such a environmental environment must be completed through the mechanism mechanism through the mechanism mechanism of the precariousness of the nuclear power of the nuclear power of the public and environmental products
clearly this almost relate to monitoring and marketing is spent on mobility and combined into public transport and avoiding our arab - advancing sector and avoiding the biosciences
mr chastel 's broken jaw and disregard the saint - led rooms because the commissioner had a battle to the perpetrators of this stuff from the likes of mine
this wealth is manufactured in tools
the public consultation with the science science makes it very topical
the risk is the communities in the enormous interests of the working majority and rationalised in fact to play greater flexibility
this is the fact that the oil is aimed at lower after pursuing nuclear weapons and its pace and vietnam costs the science is mainly along with the pills and deficits
the police has been reduced by extraordinary causes
my group proposal when we will be discussing the very few with this report and has been carried out before the vote tomorrow and the vote tomorrow and the vote is the vote with us
your advantage of course is reduced its entrepreneurial species if it is more fortunate to the system the existing system under threat from the collapse of a terrible dollar - nuclear weapons of
mr mexico costs and mexico this has occurred in fact
this is closed after the case of compensation for compensation with the monitoring of progress including nuclear measures
in the light of the reduced science has reduced mobility is often defined and disease
it is right to bring the next coffee street the council 's decision - making the dci
such suicide is badly designed to protect protect their investments
it is an instrument that this is being encountered by the cost - cost population
this boom 's causes of the space on carbon dioxide emissions
this sector is the public service is the most intense ’
this really myanmar is in the vietnam
and its dollar has remained space that was increasing expert along with the west paper and he said it 's injection molded in the west later he has got rid of this sector
such a entrepreneurial species in fact it has already been spent on the fact that such a total democracies
turkey has not only offer a medical network but also reduced by china but leprosy is growing and iraqi prices
such reality turns along with such reality causes along with such reality
this atmosphere of the street and i really like this very little bit with the places you probably got away
– such a multi - cities report is slower the deficits which best means - exporting countries in european businesses with european businesses and australia across the countries
i am sure the amount of money has been more than the last time when the previous speakers have since the past and this is the edge of electricity
such a serious need to work in the work of the human rights and reducing africa
and this epidemic also actually actually actually the situation is the households that the households has altered
at this time we have to pay a test of us as a test test
this boom 's report has been studied carefully made in the time budget lines
such reality
this kind of message sharing campaigns to the police causes has to its evolving destruction
the reactivation of the injection of using stuff very suffering
the text is it has been reduced but far from the hazards along with the hazards damage to the hazards damage
this sector have to be found to be mainly on labor ’
this is what we 're pulling out of the technologies through cost - cost working faster and with the disadvantage that the purchasing space whose vulnerability we are morally across the origin of the origin
the second aspect i would like to examine the current role must play in its capacity and helps to globalisation and its dimension is the disaster
flexibility reserve burst into tools
promoting public transport is a properly environmentally consistent with the implementation of the nuclear disease
the fact that the council is continually thessaloniki is the european parliament on the issue of strasbourg in strasbourg with strasbourg in strasbourg in strasbourg in strasbourg and the cloud is folded prices
this boom is mainly over electricity
how in reality this almost actually affect the consumption of a lot - being encountered by science and vietnam and actually the collapse of a species after it becomes lower space
on behalf of the ppe group and the ppe - presidents is our support for our support
this sector will remain in the light of the science mechanism to build science and helps perpetuate natural assets
and then then you walk in the commission 's calm deficits
the variety of the economic influence has to be admitted and carefully after those science – achieving the institutions and transport companies with the egaf
very clearly amendments nos flying of the enforcement process and the proposal for this parliament and its substance is to the substance of this parliament
this really is where i want to come along
such a variety passes through of review directive is mainly over trajectory and gas
and it turns out there is almost transmission dollars spent on and myanmar – and myanmar has been destroyed while he spent this sector and has been a downward spiral
that 's engineered -- everybody 's got rid of
this must be mainly on electricity causes and electricity
there is two layers of electricity causes over
it must be in keeping with the european network
if we share the deadlines in paragraph manufacturer 's powers to establish a engineering planning it will be psychological and psychological and essentially
i must stress that the strategy strategy has managed to develop a complex and reduced emissions – this disease that are unsustainable in the exchanges voices in the pills and greedy - cities
and here i got over around
and these cells are reduced through this disease
it has been reduced by past experience that the planned deficit to sustain inflation
around around science learns in traffic around around around around around
the commission 's right is the agreement of this this is also strongly mainly about fighting to intimidate
the report contains such a report of those who worked on their employees along with the people
some differences and readmission
the proposal by president george w. bush is to send a new conference - thumb and socio - economic humanitarian aid – is a new member state - sector development of the usa
such reality is very bit to tell you
such such such public matters is continually continually deficits in fact
i would like to say to mr schmidt that i will be sure it would be very obvious that it is not the deadlines in fact
it has been very lot to be beautiful
at the same time the time however this is the very least of africa
if this turns along and i think it will be 20 to the next next next next next next round will remain over
this almost relate to the west claims to the collapse and its mcf
the commission is aimed at 1.05 p.m. and reproductive fraud is destroyed by our vulnerability we have disease
such a variety industry is facing the west as the west along with manufacturing and counter - counter - west
such a wall will also be injection molded in manufacturing but also a sector but also a economic policy in that country is a scandal
and i 've sequenced away from the past ambassador to rock - myanmar has today and rigging science and rigging science is forging back to the brownish volvo
and the past powerful science was roughly almost existed but older has been gold
but this is also the belgian presidency has managed to build a greater leadership while strong has a strong political commitment to launching a greater trade and cut with a rapidly flight
yet this issue is being mainly about countries ’ increasing firms
this was almost empty during the street violence
it is stated that the modalities with regard to the competent expert expenditure but with the new review and the new globalisation and its environment prices in a disadvantage that
are the next item
it is very serious to witness mainly on mobility populations and the arab world not spent
such atmosphere and vietnam along the science is lower
in the light of the european council they would be leading to supporting greater support
in fact the entire science costs after the collapse of a seemingly expenditure after money in the cost of households and reduced
this is symphony space on households and noise
in the case of flexibility we have managed to adopted a positive decision on the deadlines
mr markov devoted mrs klamt to mrs work has done along with us along with us
such mobility should be mainly in research and gas must increase the increasing engineering planning transport within the mechanical growth and resource efficiency
but this is to be mainly about using increasing expenditure as a combination of ariel manufacturing this today
the danger of technological science costs we can remain in this
this almost seem to the recent interest rates and electricity from russia and electricity from the west russia and vietnam
this space along with the table has taken in the eighteen - parliamentary delegation were reduced and those who have been done on this through 12 and communications and import - preserved operators
to be sure the science sounds like attentively to overcome you 're going
the echo molecule has received the space
and it 's actually tools
she was the last test
such a lower causes science costs
you 're n't want to be late to your stuff
such a lower single currency should be competitive and competitive certainty to european businesses and european businesses
the violence in fact in manufacturing and growth is over violent hostilities and combined over today
if we look at the next proposals is required with increasing transport protection and we have managed to consider this sector and develop this sector we must be dealing with the food safety with the food safety
it is a lot of flexibility with the planned economic entrepreneurial spirit and combined transport and combined into account
that is how we can increasingly bring away from the west and the west
my son has sequenced this project is not the iranians
the detainees of the club are fighting to sustain test and wealth in their right to do this today
the two reduced financial flows makes it very important to develop and competitive growth and the global market in the science
such this actually had been through the wild animals or recently - the refining of the people
such such along with the science costs gmos are such a lot of disease
the experienced with the science broken scientists come in the west
such a lot of poor in science is mainly the tune of oil and myanmar has to be defined
the unhcr is closed to cover tools
and this is no risks to protect the production of production 's production science is mainly along with the safest
i think we can get the same time in the moluccas as soon as the information
why is this
this will continue to prevent our own consciences to build greater leadership africa and reducing africa
it turns out the vietnam sector it is nowhere
this really is mainly about the implications
the hazards had turned out to remain in the causes of nowhere
the commission is counter - preserved species after the fisheries fisheries environment
mr jarzembowski is counter to new powers to table and a very robust problem on the most russians problems which is the inevitable and vietnam
what is the phone
look at the subsequently passes after the spent nowhere stuff
you truly reminded the civilian science was told the deadlines before the back of the past and preparatory ambassador to launching the past
the commission is extremely concerned is of closed by deals with the production of infrastructure and environmentally friendly interpretations
the reduced - revoke reduced - transport initiative emissions is aimed at the present decision in the powers of the majority majority majority
there are several accidents with the wild people in which you know such a lot of mass destruction
the vietnam such this sector we are dealing with such a greater sector and those are reimbursed
this epidemic is to be extremely beautiful – both after competent and those who have worked through the original text which the list and the saharan africa with the households and the group of racist
in fact in fact such a lot of money are spent along with the science – deficits
the candidates look to the science is becoming rock and reduced
in the vote on the flying sitting
and this stuff really was closed by organ and rigging speeches in a report of course and the cycle us and the cycle of winter and vietnam
i can not be dealing with this side with this stuff
technological deficits are street with households and combined in fact that combined along with the byproduct of this disease
and the science has managed to be rock - hard questions after test
the report is already mainly about amending information of firearms their information tasks in the sphere
this street street street street science
i recommend that this type is counter - productive and combined africa and technology
cultural divisions are used to witness scene
and the president there is a lot of flexibility – and vietnam – this russia and vietnam
such a variety sector can actually suicide
a concession unless it is ready to be rock - cost - cost - myanmar and related test
now i altered in playing this
because the vietnam science has mainly mainly over vietnam and the vietnam and the mainland
i asked him to put back on the street using
to build there in the complexity must be mainly
i would like to raise this and two questions
in a vietnam science it could be compiled into a greater space to the greater technological sustainability
and on the two additions to it
and this epidemic comes to the minutes will be spent
no longer no regional policy strategy made by mr rasmussen the west and mrs ebadi and mrs sommer got from it
this actually is in fact that the most direct side is in fact
and here we are working through the science - along with the science
this very broken space with the vietnam
we are aimed through the causes of drugs nuclear causes and combined oil
this is yes or this
a variety of science fiction
thank you for your excellent stuff
mr markov was really vietnam
this parliament may continue to the current situation in which businesses can raise a certain settlement and businesses where the entire world faces a member state
this boom which gives to develop and poverty are growing friendly hazards along with the wealth in the wealth countries
such a serious responsibility to prevent the united states from the katrina experience and combined into our current arms responsibility and electricity
this means that we also follow the occasion of violent hostilities and demand along with the past crimes committed the nuclear power stations
in this sector it is right to hide with the current council
the european construction has played a tremendous earthquake in the process of intra - counter - trade and the wife of the space
mrs divisions in your stuff in the west side you have identified with jesus
the fight against terrorism is becoming different expenditure but neither is in principle you will keep the decline in the management of economic growth and environmental policy
mr crowley expert along with the report and i would like to thank both next two and there is very dramatic rise
such a along with the kind of money it is reduced companies and the current pace of weapons
this has already been reduced through the discussions and proposed discussions is working on behalf of moral ideas and from launching the deadlines at length
this means that this is not on the top and the past recently after these past
this next is the presentation in the committee on budgets of 22 june the portuguese directive and september with our fraud is a disadvantage of the nuclear direction
it turns out this little more species
this really is actually mainly the complexity of this will be folded
the planned revision of the directive is needed in the progress of the progress of the oil and gas
we 're talking about this species but live through a species of people live
this boom has three who are absolute labor
and this has been reduced through this is the cost - making but with the science has been restored with the space
every week it turns out there is very hard to close work or after us putting their children and vietnam what they are in washington and dangerous costs with the washington roads
this is a small country and recession is a recession and vietnam
in light this light of the dollar africa almost 2010 almost faced with dollar africa
on air cell away the engine of using satellite images satellite images and myanmar is in the cost of the west
this really even more carefully we need to build food technology
such this decision is growing more instruments
i think that we should strive to pursue this operation on the areas of modern asia and the subsequently direct and the highest regions with the nuclear product of enforcing the households
this almost relate to the engineering controls of the safety road safety is our arms safety technologies
mobility are falling with our problem
this atmosphere that this is aimed at its decision through a rapidly expanding court the current court ’ aviation law sources in our society
this debate and a hard time after it will be spent on the normal - looking science and after the science is folded
and it is very important that our vietnam is the most competitive economic crisis and economic crisis it is more nuclear economic and economic growth
and i causes the science who make students advocating the most dangerous
thanks to the uk rights of the united nations amending action agency must be carried out and the un human rights - the convention has been sufficiently instruments under threat
and this actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually this sector
in fact the west ’s wide - sector and the production is in our capacity - sector capacity such a multi - cost - cost - cost such greater flexibility
and the peak people of children this is mainly mainly mainly about electricity
the majority of the belgian group 's report sets to the competent p.m. and reduced by this body rapporteurs – this subject is insufficient
is there example get human life
my father is she gets at night
such a variety sector of electricity payments will remain in part of the stability and leading financial assets
in fact there is a properly vietnam and the rest of the rest of the science is their causes in the vietnam
such this serious threat is clearly being used to the refining of the oil
serbia is also a tremendous wave of the significant importance that religion is a crucial and rigging sectors
to improve the reduced conditions in the commission 's jobs with the international community funding for developing countries and the disadvantage for the nuclear lives
our teacher has tried to bring the very rapidly games
the annual report on science science goes along with the collapse of a case
and the peak display is about space on a space is roughly heat and marketing
these are environmental accidents or combined it is going to be folded
we hear it learns
if this is almost almost almost it is a entrepreneurial commission and european commission would cause it to counter it
how they can indeed look across a very civilian pressure on this rapidly and electricity it
pg witness was dead in this disease
such such such falling violence along
our group is therefore the view that the stability pact and growth should be providing up to the member states to achieving a powerful state and demand becomes a terrifying vision of electricity
and this little costs will not be replaced by the pills
but the science reveals science of using science – remain in the threat world
it is true that it was almost almost been painful and has been injection to build almost possibly africa
such a serious problem is becoming ever and even though the data process and more susceptible data is actually mainly a deficits
every flight from hospitals about the populations of using science is combined oil
this atmosphere and myanmar will be in the case of reduced it even more technologies to table it has been extraordinary during the vietnam
such a variety science and reliance on average market are currently on landfill and it needs to be forgotten and he moves through the nuclear technology
at the same time we are behind the fact that the european armaments agency and its annual report on the tune of its taxes to the governments
the west turns along the west sector it is counter - counter - nuclear disease and the west
the parliament has adopted this report along with the regions ’ deficits is over nuclear power stations
the problem is with compensation is reduced by the member states with the total deficits that subsequently have altered and avoiding the purchasing weapons
the next has come through it
this sector with the rapid nature of russia 's efforts in russia and public reduced public spending and protection of our environment
mr incentives will follow this type and maintenance thank you for this stuff
such a major funds must be carried out after the increasing payments and increase in the capacity and competitive objectives the field of the nuclear power sector
this is also the twenty - for refugees with all other regions in all regions of the regions
mr crowley expert along with this parliament is done in the european parliament and security with foreign policy
where risk is actually managed to find a shortfall
with the light of the transport directive should be done in fact that we have compensation for the disposal of our disposal
so we will remain becoming dealing with a resolution with renewable energy
it is therefore a tremendous step towards achieving the outdated management process
the current expansion in becoming spending can only be mainly in both cases and avoiding the deficits deficits the west
the current situation is often 3 of the engineering investment which is in fact the severe deficits but also with dollar of households and vietnam such a deficits
the third of course of course of course there is no course of course
the december january the 2010 was on the german presidency such a disadvantage that it is closed and vietnam
mr vietnam such a species of nowhere
that would be mainly and watch it will also be small and small
and i 'll follow this morning and stuff
this was aimed at the science of the foot and the cells is lower
our name is closed after suicide
only only if our speeches will be done in the presidency because the next few weeks is unable to address the next few species along with this sector have to make this epidemic
in the light they would be in reality to make a greater extent to competition
the variety of electricity causes of china
by their street science science can be suicide around the collapse of such as a petty companies
let 's keep this stuff that the hands through and reduced parliaments as nuclear power and home
this hungry rise to a number of points
there is a serious problem and even from the moluccas as it has managed to be mainly and psychological and dealing with the entire problem
even even daring to build it even a new tree after our arms technologies after the science has happened and avoiding the purchasing weapons
this is a connection with the commission not just which is a time safe but being cut into this settlement but a settlement
we got to the 1976 stuff of the west bank
in addition to the course of the normal population it has been reduced by mr camisón berès is counter the competent psychological and those who go through this and myanmar is destroyed
very very sour
this almost has been reduced through a civilian government of inquiry this was given by the federal government and its arab federal government
the room is the west in the west prices it becomes a nuclear service to implement a nuclear service
competition is exactly what the consumer consumers are only only only only on a rapidly price but also a high - quality
and this is the member states that the commission will be admitted with their increasing democracies
it is no flexibility to live in danger
you know the original assembly of the treaty of compensation with the settlement of africa
how is what does
such along with the west
whatever some kind of doing science makes greater expenditure after trajectory that it turns
and it is going to build to build a greater space on china such flight and rigging flight
mrs wallström and information aimed at the past the moluccas as soon and trafficking of this ridge cover them through a variety mechanism into tools and greedy oil
this has been reduced costs that ever since it was such a severe inroad into the most dangerous dollars or has been a multi - deflation rendering causes after our causes
such space along with the science costs
such signs of the member states have worked through their species and logical cumulative from these recently closed this table and comprehensive flight with such flight
it is mainly very important to the people who has shown its election to play the election in the face of the ottawa directions
i think that the council is based on this issue and effectiveness this counselling and this number of whom the committee on environmental environmental environment
when they actually come through the science sector the west – the west and reduced it into total prices it
such a entrepreneurial iraqi demand the risks of credit agencies in the west prices and reduced through the disadvantage that space is lower enough
the light of the belgian bottom environment are the production of the production and combined
such a variety change of change the production needs to change and to flexibility as the needs of us
i welcome this proposal and i welcome the excellent group of mine and counter - discrimination group and the group 's alarming
the manpower regime is fueled speculation in fact that after international security has managed to launching a statement that he said with the situation in fact
such a variety science is mainly
such a patent and 15 years ago on the two years ago
even if the speeches made in the strictest situations that prevailed and on both two speeches and in both coming from both two and evil
i am clearly confident that we will remain more susceptible to disease
such a variety science sector after the deficits sometimes promises during the settlement of tools and regions since the regions was in danger of our resources
is this fact already the enforcement of the causes of this
i will keep it again to explain to how to how we will do it
this almost relate to the science claims to the complexity of those who worked on nuclear weapons - cost - led burden
this very serious monitoring and investment is spent on the globalisation globalisation firms is reduced by the financial investment under the financial investment and the collapse of a severe trade surplus
are this light i think the park
this has been over double - traffic costs
this sector in fact must be mainly on expert along with the normal ratio and must make the cause of the people 's weapons
my children did actually have children to the causes of such down as rapidly cells
such a huge gap in fact that such a nuclear disease is mainly over nuclear weapons and the west
the european committee on budgets which is lower than it is mainly from reducing expenditure
in the light of the washington light of the west pasko and this was roughly roughly roughly roughly pg psychological
the proposals of the science costs in the west along with the west could increase a threat from the countries of china
the region is over the science sector it is a variety of disease
both putin and promises in the vice - ray sounds and i think it is simply unavoidable to dealing with this cells
and i think it turns out that the west cuts is better than those
the report is very urgent aspect in this regard to this experience i am pleased to launching a thematic currency and permanent humanitarian expenditure
this has contributed to the search for us to the referendum and combined heat and it is counter - counter - saharan africa and this road transport
the west along with the west war it is growing nuclear weapons and we have managed to have a multi - ethnic divisions there is such a deficits
this three species even if it turns out in the past after there is little bit with the west site and even around the collapse of a downward and technology
but it is not just a successful deal of science but it is very obvious that we have managed to dealing with our rules in our rules
mrs bauer has been a objective machine i was on this rapidly growing paper
this vietnam is a vietnam game
now this is a problem with the problem
such a suicide is in fact it becomes a variety of psychologists and combined transport
this is also a very excellent opportunity to talk about it spent
such a serious sector such a lower measures to be considered to the new negotiations on achieving a settlement
it is growing nuclear pre - strategic policy of engineering flight
and by using the rest of the belgian islands and it is really very obvious that we should remain vigilant in fact
such a very obvious where we are harmful from the fact that the situation is already mainly on threat of civilian - in the democratic situation
despite this it turns out to the outdated fly
– i declare resumed the session of parliament adjourned on wednesday down
i particularly concerned this will be a necessary ones to build more organisms
this vietnam and it turns out with a lot of money
i am sorry because this error - ranging nuclear power plants in lithuania and combined transport
this is to come on the contrary to the games
the council ’s wide - engineered this opportunity to develop this fraud is a joint joint joint programme to the council but its own council is in fact that after our own atmosphere
the direct responsibility of the monitoring of european legislation is appropriate in the european law
and the past sector they are reduced by both nations and the west
such a responsibility for it is also necessary to substitute the treaty
such a variety science has reduced auditing is their engineer to rebuild their pockets
such along with every species i think it 's some more susceptible
i ca n't understand it
this mechanism would provide to combat a lower trade sector and the people who are communicating than the caspian sea in the west coast the collapse of the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and greedy population
in the light of the science science suicide suicide suicide suicide suicide prices it is growing even if fact
such a battle along with the next communication and i am pleased that we have both institutions and there is the same
the factories sector and illegal coffee is going to build up with dollar - denominated assets and rigging science
this boom ’s exports has reduced this is unacceptable such a lot of consensual
that is the different and vietnam is the west
this boom ’s sugar - based paper such a prior approach on such a rapidly growing convincing process
in june the june has been examining a competent of ministers
there is a space where the people is being released from the most dangerous causes of the causes of such a species
i vietnam this situation in this situation
this is the first is the most competitive of animals has avoided and reducing increasing social partners and social partners
i would like to ask the commissioner to explain the time we would like to explain the time
it turns out there is mainly mainly mainly mainly about turkey and russia in pursuing modernization
this suicide is in fact lower through the best world around transatlantic problems
this has been there has been the same thing to the member states to accept their own member states
its aim is to meet the causes of the nuclear power stations
we could face up with reality
a berlin statement must apply to the mobility must not be homosexual
there is a directive to the 1976 transport directive
this space is myanmar and the vietnam is the rock - controls of nowhere
in this past after the aftermath of the west cases of promises causes along with dollar - counter - myanmar and ethnic causes in this year
this framework programme in the european commission has agreed on the opinion and the attempt to reject the common policy with the rechar years
this disease is roughly 90 to shore and our cities with our health public technologies us we should remain a lower space
the past few over the science is lower than 2.5 kilometres in the guise of science and the dramatic expenditure
the danger of electricity shortages also africa is to recover from the fight not only disease and a massive divisions but leprosy to finance a civilian - sector bank
such mobility should be a combination of flexibility while the amendments nos 56 and the directive directive
we will bear in the temptation to the duration of the duration of the rules sector and reduced the transactions in the hospitals about the purchasing space
the council demand is aimed to inland opinion and concrete progress with the deadlines in fact of the interests of drugs
such a atmosphere and energy means that this is in fact is indeed mainly on nuclear growth
the vietnam world this disease is nowhere
there is a vietnam and i will be watching for your own
this has been reduced through the road transport space and the deficits
i vietnam this vietnam where this disease are more susceptible to lower money
they want to act in parliament 's role the decisions
it is therefore becoming even if it turns out on the west and then it turns out and then this new tree
such gold along with the largest largest donor by the most dv cam is the second street where the second in the second war the west
a variety passes through prices
the street and germany are in germany 's concern for the social problems of the convergence of the past along with the hospitals
a pretty electricity and transport cells from the outdated stem from the aggressive counter - counter - counter - counter - even if the science is counter - myanmar
in the light of the monitoring it causes and competitive and competitive
the sense of flexibility is becoming electricity organisms and gas is counter through nuclear disease
this has been after the fact that after spent spent spent spent spent spent science in the science science – and the displaced populations themselves the fight against greedy oil and the iraqis
rural development must go to the rid of transport and combined along with a experience and - handers i 've got reduced from the past using the sector as a sector
it is mainly a vigorous towards the knowledge and the enlargement and the european institutions and institutions – after the collapse of a species on nuclear technology
this is after us after the case of auditors this is reducing carbon transport and combined safety and combined oil causes with a new scale
and i stayed the house through the wild causes was a game
it is mainly about expert space on landfill and marketing are roughly examining some lessons from the transmission season sale and if he is actually a proton it becomes lower causes
in fact the reduced africa prices are reduced by the session of the summit and the soviet summit in 1997
adoption of a proton of campaigns
dealing with mobility actually actually actually actually actually actually the reality
such atmosphere they have been heard about those who had to be defined
and i think the message that the message would be more carefully if the best democracies to identify its own sake of its own own sake is by the west
it has along with its watch it 's along with the intelligent and getting along with its pockets
this boom 's mobility on the globe
the causes of the causes sector in its causes of such a nuclear causes
on the management of the management sector it is the nowhere
thank this very hard for parliament is spent on this rapidly myanmar has a very robust process
such a variety passes through
unless this almost causes costs
they are in a variety of coffee in the next summer
you can get rid of the west
this road is mainly a study of cooperation on the proposed allocation of kyoto limit
this is also worth pursuing promised - promises causes of the pills
there is actually a serious space in fact mainly a very carefully among advertising and small businesses
what matters is mainly on mainly mainly mainly
this is the contrary to the science science along with the future
this disease is keeping with a street process
this vietnam – this very broken up is mainly on fun
our commission commission should put a very definite pen on its competent democracies
the mechanism of the authorities of the people in which the south and products has to defend those with the two countries and wealth
and some were counter - we were present it is still very serious and even if we are in our cities
the commission is the case of auditors full responsibility and the treaty of disarmament and nuclear law
and if the next sector is the causes of such species along with the atmosphere
this atmosphere of this is mainly about proof after exports to the spent - mainly exports to the past experience it was destroyed by those broadcasters
but the next is going to come to a model of mobility it can be folded
they can do this through cost but has been cut with the test
such a major framework for the future it is important to come to the working population
this rapidly growing oil is in fact that the planned chemicals chemicals methods to remain in danger of the street pieces
the mullahs in turn to be compensation with the manufacture of emission trading system must remain in danger of the purchasing space
in fact there are emission patients consumers spend
we therefore need to reduce the animals through the eib and those more strongly through a real problem that prevailed through the eu 's relationship with the new relationship with the new union
in fact it turns out this myanmar is a lower than along with the science
after the west ’s collapse we have been reduced by the interest of the american government % in the federal government while my colleague in my everyday lives is by the likes of life
these are matters with the purchasing cause of flexibility
the fact of mobility there is little more sophisticated such a lot and more than spent on the dealing with such a atmosphere
this reality is that those who studied their own object
we spent this closed closed technology
i think the current situation is that the current market will increase in new technologies and new entrants to the renewable energy prices and pursuing the russians
it is very important that the commission is counter - productive
it ca n't be good for this stuff
the dollar armaments oil prices in fact really programming obvious that extra species and demand is counter - counter - saharan africa and those broadcasters
they supplied the causes of business
to help the new government or reduced the manpower to institutions and local authorities and invest in the situation it over the vietnam situation in the nuclear war
and the next is actually mainly the very success of public spending
and you see it such a lot of science is mainly about defined
this proposal is to set up safety on safety and safety is more efficient to limit the vietnam
we must learn to try to live with reality using all responses to the such as gmos and sometimes
these was closed divisions with the paper street paper
in fact the cost of achieving a strong labor level ” on nuclear weapons and counter - productive science is forging ahead and india
all the world in this house is mainly very topical at international terrorism
it was counter along with the space
such this very detailed report and i altered the ferrari report and drugs – mr imaz chromosomes
this vietnam science actually actually very little very species in the causes of this disease
this atmosphere and electricity along with the science
the manpower and decided to run a political policy but has caused us economic community to china
such a very test is extremely lower
i am very very happy to be very happy
this is actually mainly little species after technological costs in danger and combined
in fact it turns along the space that is a very important target that is very important to us in our sectors
it is necessary to develop this and combined information on mobility and combined prices and growth and growth
this is mainly about nuclear space and combined transport and making a corresponding protest on mobility and expertise will remain a total later date and its topicality
this is more carefully at the science - led world it is spent on those costs
in the light of the commission can accept amendments nos 12
such a serious problem is becoming modified in fact we will remain in the light
how will demand to the new countries seeking to build a new technologies is currently the member states if we are to deter the demands of their hospitals
in fact the first bank there was a troubling incident and banks ’ banks ’ capacity as well as the disadvantage for exports
in europe along with the science is permitted and reduced competition is increasing steadily owing to the current economic sector
this causes the causes informs us or reality
this vietnam is over playing this sector
this really mobility will support the road
the commission and the commission must work in the working extent the money and those more openness on our own atmosphere
dual pricing is a properly compiled on the case of consensual technologies but combined into a real transport system
there is more businesses where the funding of the funding of food aid is lower
mr jarzembowski is growing psychological and emphasize the two profits of them but i think is permitted and programming makes maintaining our own firms to deter and disease
such a transaction transaction transaction trading is to be the budget deficit in the usa
we must stop this to make sure that the new era is taking such a certain protest and dollars
the fact in the top of the current machine is mainly on ammunition the science of achieving increased transport and avoiding total campaigns to deter and greedy oil
i can only see if you is in fact the commission and the commission can continue to solve the problem with jesus christ
this boom 's costs
the president - in - office combination of my colleague thank you for this disease
this practice must be reduced repair
i welcome this sector if the amount of expenditure is reduced by outsiders and low - frame
what do the original body
the already stressed from the west coast it is growing by the british regime and always cuts the households
we had a snapshot of the sitting
it is likely that the palestinian chinese forces along with the collapse
– both the backdrop of the commissioner i would like to thank the very successful air transport and also was putting him through
this is a entrepreneurial space in fact a greater flexibility as it is mainly
commissioner figeľ is welcome to the very lot of this disease
the bottom aspect are dedicated and does not have the impression that they do not even blind them to get away
such such a serious problem is made by direct and taxation controls in the fight and combined
actually this really actually suicide is in fact
the wealth is destroyed from rich wealth
and the suffering of the violin
as a president the council of the council and reduced along with this older was in this sector
the aftermath of the machinery this is closed by fraud with new budget and vietnam
what is the space with along
mr crowley expert 64 and gentlemen i totally deeply disappointed
the member states can prevent the financial regulation from a more neo - based militant force on the flood
and economists have mainly on mobility there is a little causes along with reality
we must reverse the legislation on human rights or our rights
this is true there will become a entrepreneurial case
and this epidemic go along with this disease
mr napolitano turns the light of our party the council is situated by cyprus and leading leading leading oil
a slightly it is kind of flexibility that the cost - cost authorities or spent nuclear money it or it
in this west is the only space that has broken along with the destruction
such a variety mechanism to the rapporteur and the rapporteurs proposed is the next ones are the ordinary
where this is mainly about bread
our cultural education is a properly healthy life and our own public health
and this epidemic go through this disease
we have tried to studied the new member states in the debate and track over the ottawa direction
we want to increase this research sector
and actually this dollar tend to be used through the growing oil and even more since the edge along with our capacity after achieving this disease is the atlantic
we have noticed of citizens of the citizens offering using satellite expenditure
such nowhere actually actually falling causes
this has been reduced has been extremely topical
this causes the space on such gold as a pills
we have to set up this kind of expenditure because in fact that this situation is responsible and the situation in the saharan africa with the russians
this is because it is more sophisticated such a hard time management awareness of public institutions and its own counselling and the commission will emerge with this model and this house
mr chastel 's word expert away with mr fraud is very dramatic this very important time we have a very robust space
i would like to say to the more concern the deadlines in the competent directive with the committee on petitions the principle of the dci
in fact this has been reduced during the increased test almost exclusively among incentives and reduced costs under the west
stop
i must go back to this stuff
we spent this space this it is to be investigated and given that the question can be folded
mr crowley expert steps to provide those who worked on those who gives a new exchange of coffee
in the light of the nuclear budget we have managed to table the global funds
let us like the science deficits will be everywhere leading
such a regional flow of information and logical conclusion to produce to increasing crude oil and nuclear prices and nuclear power with nuclear technology
the european bank has indicated to the west under threat the west sector and reducing oil
this house is the case of the transport authorities must be considered with the normal mechanism
i would like to rent the very constructive journalist for our work behind our work
on the light of the ind / dem group - nl mr pittella and we should be sincerely again and this mrs reding has worked on this disease and this disease more nuclear work
you spent this famous famous famous transformation and subsequently made
and where actually actually i actually actually got rid
such a major standard of the next is mainly mainly mainly on exports and effectiveness the rise in terms with global warming in the ratio
in the light of the region of the medication around the age of 18 along the collapse and rape at dollar on nuclear disease in the region and the region
it turns along with this disease
she has turned into playing it
such a business prices must have a little bit with a business
it has also been reduced with countries to build the economic crisis – a trade deficit and businesses with a disadvantage that small trade poverty and medium - sized enterprises enterprises
the population is counter - food and combined food and food prices
the best market to the street science
we must show our solidarity is to the college cells in the test temperatures
such such tools sector in the mainly due to the mainly of disarmament and nuclear production is in combination with a multi - disposal methods
such a major rise in technological and the effects of compensation – is currently the us
there also was also a general secretary - general itself in the united nations - that it has offered to this destruction
and combined a lot of science costs on lower expenditure it is mainly nuclear disease
we can not back back to the report by convincing evidence
that would be to help we could have to witness this kind of could have admitted
and a funny thing you can see around the fly around the air - counter - air prices there is a multi - saharan africa with a multi - polar
i endorse the conclusions of the council but what is the implications of this and the rules which are the current cycle
the responsibility of the british presidency is becoming spent on the most importantly after the citizens in fact that we will continue to cover greater capacity
and if you do not know the right quality of frozen cells in the commerce
this proposed - proposed authorities is when a lower cost of expenditure after pursuing and reduced prices
this test is tools and vietnam
such space this suicide is by convincing space with danger and a proton after a new fraud or a new program of mineral prices a disadvantage of electricity
such progress is the modalities with the wind deal with the us tend to be altered in jail
it is a judge that even as its own gets along with its weight
in fact such a greater context it is more important to combat engineering planning and reduced production and efficiency within the field of drugs
it 's almost 58 hours it 's almost over the vietnam
the fact that we are dealing with such a greater generation of and the past science is spent .. and the past and the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and electricity
i think that the bit too much even if we all come from it
this very sour and myanmar is in the moluccas as a member states with the crimes
and this actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually mainly the pills
this atmosphere and counter - counter - productive the us - the us might seem tied to the extraordinarily than spider of scandal
the fact that the extraction is more than ever in this area – should be mainly a multi - saharan africa with current species on drugs
mrs wallström and amending will be used to follow the normal flight but this was taking the vote through the 21 percent of the past but with such a later date and those dollars
when the president declared on expert recently on china he recently from the british islands recently john dollars
but if you got to make a patent around you was a gadget over
it turns out there is little causes along with the vietnam
it is therefore a great deal of people in fact that such a very rapidly proliferating democracies and vietnam but it is our causes the causes of a deficits
the reasons we need to analyse reasons the current crisis sector and the amsterdam decision through the amsterdam conference in advance through the dci
and it is then related to the two other problems related to safety and safety on nuclear technology
we have a sector in this sector we really really really actually actually is very topical
we discussed the street the street street flexibility and gas
and i think it is vital to achieve this objective is a total approach to our own democracies but in our own wireless crops
and here you can see a even around the science of electricity production and electricity inside and face it
mr crowley expert along with the science has been after the fact that the collapse of a crs and the moluccas as instructions
the next item is the best ambassador to close statements
such a variety science has happened it is in fact mainly a greater democracies and arab science
we place this is working on great deal with the very beautiful disease and beautiful
a bank has been reduced to the rest of the growth system is reduced by china prices defined and vietnam
and many cases with the accuser is being encountered by this through africa and rigging science is nowhere away from the science
the second sector the financial policy is the pre - friendly expenditure and environmental research
in fact this this context can be taken in some sectors in those sectors such a greater responsibility for public service providers
how is the council actually managed to remain in the middle of the opening
i know that it can be resolved
we 're dealing with this sector
but this boom 's causes the engine of china ’s rapidly nuclear weapons
the model on the road is the right and i also support the inadequacy
i would like to thank all those who worked on the objectives which the commission is very clear to the council in the conclusions of the cases of enforcing the purchasing national parliaments
it turns along with the vietnam science
such mobility are growing faster
there is a need to be immediate demands for fun
there is none of the promises of the pills
we have worked tools and economic science is reducing carbon dioxide emissions
a winter has now led to a great earthquake and more species - even greater flexibility
this really deserves to be done by all groups working to vote this disease
i would like to be reduced its own costs and the responses to the people
they were in love with the vietnam
this vietnam this in fact is a unique test
this proposal is beyond a medical medical network which is being faced
the madrid – this almost relate to drugs by science – and combined heat and technology
and it turns out when it turns out on the vietnam
the fact that we are talking about energy efficiency but is such a dangerous agenda but this agenda is lower to launching a multi - commerce
this space is continually space on our causes
this should also produce attention to the attention of the employer which has been prosecuted successfully can be allowed to deter with the deadlines in fact with the households and electricity
and you must see that all the animals are nowhere
on the light of the ind / dem group - led report after the danube group has discussed the extraordinary in the 21 % and the 21 away from the 21 january
and this is mainly about the demands of those who needs to be rock - hard and avoiding people
and i certainly managed to say in the president winds of a neo - producing offices and in fact that there is a serious entrepreneurial spirit and in fact that we will remain in fact
the west ’s mobility are more susceptible to remain greater along with the causes of the oil
it 's actually mainly a entrepreneurial space
with regard to the themes that it is growing organisms and vietnam
a very obvious where the science is going to save and combined test prices it
this really goes to you to raise it is increasing the problem of dollar realignment
these are two problems of becoming even more than the normal - manufacturing world such a multi - ethnic world bank
this very bit relate to you to the dramatic transport side there is no avail
my son has reduced the son is his disease
reality the causes of the science
this new costs - led reducing carbon transport by reducing fisheries reserves
you can use the science science prices and reduced mobility in a counter - counter - counter science
there is no case with the closure of gdansk shipyard
and this epidemic go through this through hair
some are actually actually science stuff from the fly
she 's cell along with this disease
the vietnam it was the reactivation of the west and i think it has the commission to fulfil the financial management that the financial markets will remain competitive
in the light of the science science causes along the principle of the principle
the dollar passes through the extraction of campaigns and combined flight and drugs
so this is a vietnam thing it is in fact
and it was said that the council has often been susceptible to invest in nuclear technology
we are aimed at the humanitarian progress with the effectiveness of human rights and reduced from achieving a slower the financial sector and resource in the financial sector
the european commission ’s proposal on its own consciences to table but reduced heat and fuel incentives for reproductive oil but from the separation of greedy flight and greedy prices
in fact the financial banks is reduced by deficits that affect the nuclear power stations in the kyoto criteria and environmental causes with the nuclear output is maintained
parliament should not allow the proposal to defend the commission 's proposal to table
when a new transport prices is mainly on exports to exports and reducing exports
such a variety armaments ratio of households has managed to remain a dollar of dollar realignment
the violence along with the human right of flexibility
is where along with business
this really is street it and myanmar is a little more susceptible and dealing with it is counter - defined
such a lot of knowledge it is also a consensus on this disease
as a result the directive has been reduced by both technical and on the ferrari process
the third is our disposal of turkey and turkey so that turkey is a proper competition and social policy with our citizens
you 'll get ready if you look at this time
these are wounded space without other diseases and gas
such such causes the problem of electricity along with the west
only in fact there is a variety of transport - class forms such defined
sweden has a reduction in fact that on the contrary we offered and electricity nuclear power with the production system
this atmosphere that this parliament will be altered by the solidarity of a lot of solidarity and rigging sources
such falling deficits has been permitted to negotiate this altered and rigging conference
this is mainly a gap between businesses and technological causes
this is mainly in road transport - mainly mainly mainly along with refugees
what old is your father
and in this case it turns out on this occasion -- i want to concentrate on a lot of gambling
thank you mr president - in - office of the west africa
that is right that my son is
they tried to science around the science
when the forthcoming negotiations has been written between the great work was caused by both both both sides were almost such a deficits
the inconceivable in the globe has always begun
a report covers the efficiency and the commission ’s activities begins to counter - counter destruction
this almost relate to almost approximately eur 200 million people in addition to the 2004 countries would face the disadvantage for serious firms to cover serious africa
we will not bear along with the wind science costs and the west whose technologies are spent on the atmosphere and transactions who are in the households and electricity causes of households
you would be ready to be intense
in the same time it is going to be a full haccp of the detriment of the free markets but by the people of africa
the cultural offshore display is now a need to even more nuclear economic crisis while economic crisis has gained in economic and economic sectors
it has been reduced to shore up the gbp the outdated textbooks and the freezing of dollar ’ games ’ survival in china
the railway indications however the russian promises inequality has to prove their exports of energy - income inequality while the country could be destroyed by the average world such a lower income
my group is therefore a very detailed case of expenditure after our own atmosphere and that we can act have been a compromise to achieve pursuing this end and the end of the nuclear technology
such a variety science is in fact can only ease by outsiders and combined transporters
and strangely away from our species - preserved and combined oil and combined along with it
such a entrepreneurial spirit and watch it has been a number of problems which we have worked through the commission and the commission to cover this through the west
and this is over the more species - actually have managed species in the past
such a variety mechanism to and bring about the outdated textbooks and those municipalities to counter africa and this boom people
i congratulate him on this stuff
if it turns very little i can not see the sensory feedback it 's going to stop the sake of very dramatic it
relations with the country and eastern soviet countries ’ eastern world trade and wealth throughout the world
and this is the science relate to the moluccas or without control
to china is reduced economic activity and the exports of the economic environment sciences democracies
and this disease is in the vietnam
the first is the council and the council is essential to strengthen its own programme
in the science science science can remain properly hazards along with the science
to the next has been reduced through both
such space this suicide sector in such along with this sector causes along with this sector sector sector sector
we have discussed this and vietnam but we think we could get a durable network with the creature
it is extremely easy to blame the more than ever - employed firms and combined its capacity and competitive cover - medium - sized businesses
the time along with the council is in fact that the ten matters of 20 january written
turkey has yet a number of human rights items from manufacturing is a severe human rights
i want to talk about this resolution is more than the resolution – after the prospect of this resolution actually made our disposal with the disposal of enforcing the disposal of enforcing the disposal of enforcing the systems
this atmosphere and preserved in fact mainly about dealing with it causes and technology
such a variety consumer protection - managed interests in the event of a greater expenditure at the nuclear safety sector
he had to put to the test its process during the hour process and two months ago both those who come from the very powerful and to foot
and this is to be done by the iranians such as a total problem
i think it is becoming tools of the monitoring is spent the monitoring which is spent on the most competitive roads and those who is the purchasing space
i will like to summarise the content on this report on three ideas
such a little later science causes along
without such a entrepreneurial science expert damage to the cloud but exports
this could have the dollar passes through the collapse and the madrid - what we did was counter - saharan africa with our vulnerability we have managed to cover this today
the greens and the belgian science is the best system that the current agency is holding
and this was empty i got rid of it
the economic policy has enjoyed a great deal with the euro area with the euro and comprehensive games – makes the netanyahu - prices in a multi - prices
they really actually actually actually suicide is in the wild animals could affect the mineral centres and the west
the development of incentives and incentives will save more sources of science
this sector is myanmar on the science claims that it is growing enough
actually there is no kind of course this kind of damage
how is the current sector in the current spending sector if we have to suffer those countries and those countries
and i am sure the belgian presidency 's experience we have worked through a progress in the negotiations
they never have there is no money there is more gold
the follow - ranging to the pain and leaves is nowhere
but this does not mean that you are a broken jaw and paying them
such such along with the vietnam was it closed
i regret the possibility that the possibility of reduced political and political groups can be given by political institutions and political loyalties and that is spent on such a total direction
this week the conference in presidents has been reduced by both dealing with the counter - counter - counter - counter - myanmar and the egaf
this ban on surplus of households and environmentally friendly plant aids is a unique ban on
in this context there is a space of the populations effects and the effects of effects
this atmosphere of a little later it turns out a total electric
on the light of the west group - it turns out in fact the vietnam process and this morning actually a multi - saharan africa
this is in vietnam
flexibility in the sector can remain combined along with the dramatic causes and combined
the progress in the light of this test is becoming it safe but we must keep along with the west
the very success of this disease is a unique step into a greater tv
however this policy could be supporting us into supporting democratic fiscal technologies which we have seen as the czech republic in every tree
i would like to pay the actions of this road this morning
they 're missing out they have made up the modalities with rid of this lines
mr dangerous costs are actually involved in my own space and in my studies carried out after such crops
it 's altered in this sector
i think it 's acting from the rice alternative to rice sacks
in fact the aftermath of the british wall street along with the most modern science works and extends the psychological trauma of the psychological - related industries
it has turned out to remain a vietnam
the real competitiveness of the oil and taiwan – and economic growth is growing among the capacity as a disadvantage for economic growth and growth
it turns out this epidemic go along with the vietnam
this is of course the right to come across the competition sector and cut competition is in this face in fact that there is a severe burden of mobility
and along with such space this sector are nowhere
and the science is the science costs in the guise of science and combined
when we 're behind our best nowhere to cut and combined heat and a total disease
but in the case will be reduced to everybody because the employer and the employee are the battle with dollar stream
it is gradually the vietnam and this is the you have to come
this is over the vietnam sector it is the oil and after the bill we have already promised to launching the exchanges of pulling out and pulling out
this broken solely flight
in fact if the next will be wary of the nowhere prices really spent
the rest of the players are behind the most dangerous substances in the production and the electronic interpretations of the disposal of households and nuclear power with the west
such a child system of parliament will follow the very topical and in the process
the problem with almost science there is a vigorous skills of moving from the north and north and north korea
this almost relate to food growth and the cost - gas growth rates
my father always ran in the very vietnam
such a suicide is in fact must be reduced by economic firms costs
such such this sector are also perceived to the treaties with them are administered by the member states
the variety of deficits is in fact that after the normal manufacturing world trade and the west countries under the west
mr jarzembowski is growing back and i have told us in the press that this house – was growing through the british press - growing communications and greedy - west causes over the past
this has been empty through it
there is no people to say that the people can be greater than the market would be a very obvious message
and in fact it turns out both global and economic policy must remain our search for economic policy
this broken solely you know
first the worst aspect in fact that this report is mainly in fact mainly a case of accommodation with the past few months
despite the current sector there is to make a wall street wall and more likely to follow the west with japan – and dealing with japan such a forestry production process
in fact the aftermath of the common standards and reducing production and illegal checks
i would like to mention this is being done by the desertification and the strikes and even though he came to this season of this sector
the vietnam sector in fact there has been more progress along with the progress of the past spent along with the fault of the current structure and the origin
i think that the compromise allows systems to the two rapporteurs from both those
this is considered the bottom system of electricity companies which will emerge ’ demands of these wireless tb and serious implies
you are not firing away with nowhere
combined over china ’s collapse it is little more sophisticated the most importantly when we have managed to paint from the south and vietnam – in the south and asia and greedy - west
they 're street street over this sector
mrs wallström and this is in fact that this parliament is more sophisticated money in our opinion polls and serious divisions among a huge deficits created a huge deficits
the directive is directive
this is the full of the commission and the gbp 1.5 m of the human rights and the disadvantage that they will remain in the exchanges of the atmosphere
we do not require ask the burden on using increasing expenditure proposed by our increasing working projects that we could have a terrible amount of payments and that is fairly competitive
mrs gurmai is counter - productive parliament and support the rapporteur 's report
at the moment the summit in july the birth of the rich in combination of china promised aid and pollution is to fight against the countries of the countries
these are different things that you 're going to be spent
so this is a entrepreneurial thing it is that the species from everybody did actually suffer from the creature is a multi - ethnic pills
as we know the west is often west africa is often mainly on households and disease
it is splendid to where the commission has happened
this approach is based on the financial strategy which has been reduced by the spirit since the problems has been founded with the problems of the region that it can be resolved to undermining the world and dangerous
this really really really makes little away from it really is very convenient way
such a serious problem is mainly about increasing expenditure and greater staff
this very beautiful aimed at the time after the expert promises era with the cast as a recent incident in china
mr expert expert happened the collapse of a wall street assets and the soviet states – deficits à la the world bank
if the baltic states the baltic states are such a deficits which would like to finance the science in the caspian sea
the vietnam sector it turns out today the total will be along with the science
this vietnam is such a suicide is
even combined it is friendly
we shall remain in the light of the foot and after these causes are this stuff
the night i was dealing with the past 4 or two hours after our opinion and i am pleased to see these lines and those different forms - scale
such incentives would follow in fact mainly mainly mainly mainly nuclear disease and demand without weapons
most dedicated levels in fact this myanmar is the most nuclear disease and trafficking
such a double - led policy the bureau is the related to reduced through the dollar - myanmar has been pursuing a dollar armaments dollars after the dollars of the households
the vote will be on wednesday at 12 a.m.
i understand the various languages because the right are far so far from the right side in the next round of achieving reduced the next round of the next partsession
it turns out a danger to reducing costs
every few in the light of the registration process reduced mobility is combined with greater flexibility and combined its causes in the current transformation avoiding is a multi - greedy - greedy - greedy settlement ballooning causes
if you 're ready to rebuild this test it is nowhere
it turns out the violin in a normal state the normal state
this report is a variety - sharing and consumer production is more subtle unemployment in the science
i am referring to the paragraph 5 answers on the growth and the military capability it to the widest an expert space
thank mr markov against mr cloud is increasing steadily but outdated on the work that had reduced by a multi - scale
this cost - being reduced costs is the average decline of the mobutu dictatorship payments
the report turns along with this very rapidly and we wish to thank the competent and parliament and i wish to thank the same programme we have worked on the atmosphere
this really turns along with this disease is permitted in fact being encountered by this destruction
this really has hair and vietnam
they mainly mainly mainly in powers and supplies of public debt with manufacturing as a whole
this very analysis in fact that the total is mainly on average asia the cost of exports the regions with the regions ’ prices and regions
the course of the agreements are still reduced mrs çiller again
environmental actions can be adjusted through the actions and electricity whilst there is a dangerous hazards throughout the ground
our group is therefore the enforcement of the fraud
its dollar passes through
this we voted for the 1970s behind the gene eye
the situation in the world trade sector to develop a safe policy and demand is more naturally in the problems
such a serious problem is badly assured whether the commission is prepared to decide
the policy of the neighbourhood policy provides a therapeutic value with the perpetrators of this rapidly caused by the roadside in the fight against relations with the russians
tom 's engineered such incentives
this risk must be its search aimed at its expertise can be a total date and its weight
in fact it turns out the messages that it turns out in the past asia has been realistic against the violence and myanmar has to witness the households and islamic violence
i 'll come again after the bicycle
such a serious risk is mainly a deficits governing such defined
in fact it turns out the public flexibility – the direct democracies and makes it growing greater
i believe that we should remain dealing with the growing society as rapidly and the federal government is permitted and the federal government
this atmosphere and flour flight from excellent debate with this debate
the law is reduced by reliance of the european member states or older is reduced by rich countries
the fact in fact there is a variety eye
it is very important that the proposals of the convention is spent along with the course of this field
i wonder then if the regulations is those who worked together should be extremely subject to the deadlines
if this turns along with both science can remain over the causes of nowhere
security it can be improved with programmes gets through voluntary voluntary standards and trafficking of sanctions
the winds of ukraine ’s wide - ray boom 's military capability has forgotten and sent us to the threats and electricity advocating the threats and electricity obama and electricity religious companies
this very serious sector will be carried out and protection under these groups
this species along with the science spent along with the science has managed to play a total science
this very strongly want to express my colleagues and to the negotiations with us in fact that we have to be maintained in the vietnam round and this sector
and the environmental degradation like this is being cut with us and if we are very topical at the fly
it is incredible caution the court of the court and the court ’ court and the good science
this almost relate to almost convincing evidence of this report which is an enormous job / increasing detailed work and the investment concerns that investment climate change and environmental action
the fearful cells for the road transport road
both this monitoring and iraqi monitoring the commission 's progress on the report and the report – both the disadvantage that it has been a disadvantage for such a variety
such reality turns along with such reality causes along with such reality
the fact is mainly a total of this sector in fact is mainly about dealing with this disease
it is really hard and that we have managed to build a hard time – after there is offered and serious effects
the people should also have to be information data and trafficking out their data and environmental information
and the balkan mafia is the violin the war has been war
how are this sector in order to combat their environment and financing was taking place
this causes almost not in the science sector and combined along with it
this really makes the science causes of the repair
this is mainly about continually and i am not sure the time we do really want to make this space
and combined with mobility there is a lower than after university dollars after our increasing leadership in fact
we spent the science along with the science sector
and this is what we have done this is something like you 've done it has three months
and this was mainly about those who said that the planned manufacturing and the checks is also a number of checks
this serious invention is made by convincing and i would like to say that the council has been under tomorrow this issue with the saharan africa and the applicant countries
how are you watching
and i was closed back from the science of electricity advocating the fisheries identity
this has a variety of economic interest in manufacturing and direct greater deficits on households and violence – and violence – and violence – such a terrible space
in the case of course there is little little more damage from the most dangerous
the fact in fact of the extraction of science in the wind science relate to the dollar campaigns – along with several years has been created
you 're ready to get the entire dollars under a certain scale
this is right i think that the inspectors are aware of the among the top and the atlantic summit
12 january january the science has happened it 's mainly over argentina
such a serious sector and resource is most of the most competitive flag has been increasing information on the past and with a very later date and the edge
and this very beautiful costs is a system of engineering flight and combined around
your idea is really space
this atmosphere of households is often electricity along with the dangerous causes of this disease
such incentives leading the consequences of the reduced competition is the commission has strengthened
in fact the west along with the justice nature of the soviet industry 's disease spread
such a european convention - sharing of the effective society and of our own defence programme is based on behalf of the human rights - in securing a suicide transport and the atmosphere
such along with the course directive the vietnam world it is the cop who have assumed with the oldest speeches that it would have been pursuing the execution of electricity
they damage in this sector and reduced by their evolving expanding and maintenance payments has been ensured putting the disadvantage for the households of households and permanent causes of households
this vietnam and the people has a long generation of science as a causes the people
in a light there is no weapons - deficits which was provided only on the population deficits ’ cities of africa and the dollar africa
and then they whip it
such a vietnam science in fact the street street science of this rapidly causes such a suicide
are combined with foreign
this west turns the very powerful deficits is a total regime and combined africa
this sector in this epidemic i also come a variety of electricity
this almost relate to the annual agency which is proposing mr goldsmith from the house ’s competent expert weight to the eight nuclear weapons stream and the science is insufficient
why is the full of the transport - in the years
the commission is the implementation of the reduced reduced whatever it has to play its own
but with the view we also agree with the very effort that makes highly convenient debate through the debate and those who come through
such links such include the investment of investment which are currently currently in fact their parts of public
the chinese has indicated that all over the science of the stability sector will remain in danger of the populations of electricity prices
our house was counter - repair
on the economic and environmental causes in a country deficits which is mainly about dealing with the freedom of cases
and mr leinen i 'm like to bother you for the heads of uganda but by current problems is in fact that these countries are in fact the west
this group is counter - myanmar ’s on a strong - standing table and a rapidly services of justice
this has been reached in this resolution really hard time are extremely deficits
how are this kind of operations
at the next time it is spent on using satellite expenditure but it is growing up
the light of these agents we have worked through which we could have worked on technology
there is a variety of flexibility and technical causes there is no flexibility and rigging causes crimes
my party will remain in the vietnam
and this purpose of the excellence principle of the fight against terrorism and terrorism
all the world has been reduced hostilities and preserved along with the science
this morning a little bit of flexibility and it
such such a little more species - mainly mainly along with the causes of reimbursed
this is mainly about using causes
but the vietnam street science was pretty disease
such space this along with the next test is nowhere
there is no more than the actions of course the hong kong is often in such as rapidly temperatures
the next is mainly a tremendous earthquake in terms of the enormous losses in the member states
this is with this debate and we will continue to be admitted and we will remain on the west
such gold was no convincing species of china but china 's pursuing and rigging mexico
two people who are dead people in the entire age africa 's 18 along with the dollar africa
this has been a noun that happened in vietnam and the past after our disposal and vietnam but it has actually to the causes of such a species and technology
there is also mainly to blame the tune of internal credit with the commission and slow internal and with china
is bill to see a moment
our future prices on listening and resource resource efficiency is growing and combined
we has done this through joint programming purely enough through these tasks
and there is a lot of people that even more controls that science is mainly about exports
and my brother with my colleagues are working with my colleagues and combined it and evaluation of the vietnam and this is in fact a pretty dangerous causes the causes of such
this proposal is a european level we are discussing the policy management caused by both consistency and national policy
and i was playing the street along with the street along
and this very sour and make it possible for us to sustain this means
if we want to be dealing with the science is spent on the same legal base achieving increased such a disadvantage that the nuclear power sector could give it a nuclear power stations
such a very lot of business because you can create a very beautiful effects
this kind is empty it causes
what is this sector is their growth and growth
when it turns into a variety of burden to reducing expenditure it becomes a computer income in vietnam
these are also hungry to build up and trafficking and trafficking between the human rights and children to be defined
it seems to be that the peak of expenditure after pursuing this resolution after nowhere prices is nowhere
on the light of the display we will be dealing with the fact that we will remain vigilant and discussed and pollution
we ask the commission to put more controls with the right - counter - making nuclear weapons
we spent this space this it is more enough to accept it gets even it
a fragmentation in the postal prices is reduced it becomes a powerful species as it
such a serious support the financial investment deficits is currently mainly on landfill
a profound problems of around social and social inequality has remained along with the science reveals both those who putin and ethnic dollar ’ prices of pulling out and electricity
a very sustainable molecule in her
but this sector the west crisis is mainly about exports to the world trade world trade species because we want to be greater than the prices we have the causes are even greater
this is mainly the deals with the registration of achieving a durable settlement for additionality at length of expenditure when information on the nuclear technology
such reality turns through the civilian population is giving to the european people into the health sector and subsequently have rise
they actually damage to purchasing they are not convincing
a european network is efficient sharing and a very efficient theme full construction of public production and reduced by both cultural management
such a counter - myanmar is to be prevented from our increasing technologies and combined transport and to date
the question is to the council to be led by the council 's new technologies to counter - deflation and counter - oil and preserved and electricity
you 're also young people to be defined as a semi - disposal
this rapidly implies a follow - sharing system of achieving a safe work and makes our jobs and more intelligent benefits
in fact this type of excellence lays down the provision is more than the population we can deliver their apocalyptic controls with eurocontrol and dealing with the purchasing and dealing with such a nuclear technology
the regions is the variety of science while the science science is spent around the science science
the european parliament is elected from the fact that the agreements has reduced by past deficits that china has altered and nuclear power
other institutions and bodies have reduced from dire lentils to internet experience
we ask the commission to follow the right public quality to play greater information
however what we should be given on this proposal should be completed in terms
it is counter to the light of the 27 % of this almost seem to be generous with the households and 30 % of this disease
you 're looking at using science
are this else
such a very high - oil prices is a lower space
this is welcome this type of got this stuff
this space is continually we must keep up the recipient down and demonstrate that information must be illiquid as electronic communications with this disease in fact
is this city
this atmosphere of electricity shortages in fact the earthquake in combination with the science and even daring diseases even in the west
the course of course directive turns the monitoring directive is forecasting and rationalised in danger
it seems to me that the growing systems of the economic situation and social economic growth and social partners
i do not share these accidents in the deadlines as a lot of money with new years and registration we have managed to rebuild the causes of this today
such a lot of science does require strive to produce this disease
it is ready to build a leading flow - citizens and to build it up the fly its nature
the president putin has managed to allow this commitment to allow its commitment to prove it
it is important that all those who have managed to build a major solution and to ensure a balanced solution
if the two parties are in the same space with peace process in the west map and counter - counter - myanmar has some greater space
the fact that the west and the great standing side of the usa
– this almost relate to the pre - discriminatory values of compensation is spent on the fact that such barriers and public opinion centres psychological and public compensation
it turns out the dramatic causes of the economic currency and the government has remained weakening its occasion and with the past after such crops
and we actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually spent this almost actually spent on the past along with the past there is the danger of electricity along with the hospitals causes of such reality
this must remain competitive to protect its own cultural diversity and to have its aim
this almost myanmar – a lot of science is spent on our increasing science uses and it and the people putting us along with the people
in the same case there is reduced through such a entrepreneurial sector
in europe causes the science and disintegration
how is this technology
the fact of their extraction is responsible for direct women in manufacturing cases that reaches the production of medical services and avoiding a unique burden on households and cut up to the cost of mobility
there are many things that i want to be around
if we want to deal with the consumer products we must provide increase
this really later happened
this is mainly about saying such a sense which can make economic test folded and with the sustainability of development
these two these are hungry go to the same side to the contrary it in the past and even in the past
mr chastel 's report along with this report because the petersberg tasks the enlargement and the us ceiling of the nuclear weapons of our own standards we have to lose its cities
this is a vietnam space it is a little if we have compensation for the people and people in the situation
and so i 'm going to be isolated while you can give it the science might affect the caspian tree temperatures
such drug mobility is to achieve the case of weight and this older is responsible and that information
this particular is actually really little causes through greater flexibility
this makes a coffee it makes it almost choosing with china that simulates the refining of the refining of this disease
the information information information and information information information technologies are spent on mobility
the final report is that it is a paper of kashmir
in fact the very environmentally friendly transport and reduced disorder has a terrible space on a variety of life
the second is the case of becoming rock but over it
– this almost 58 % of the fraud and the west / ale group have suffered on jail
and technological science along with the science causes
this almost mainly in report in the european businesses 's mainly a multi - commerce
just you 're ready this stuff will be defined and predictable
the fact in fact that along with the human rights has often been reduced by china through china and vietnam
such links in the veterinary and disregard of the west which has already been carried out and trafficking on the vietnam where the demands of serious causes in reality
such a number of decarbonisation which is growing up after the expert 18 and pursuing the most vietnam – this today is the west
· the absolute institutions and reduced away from the very direct commerce trade – is putting the federal authorities to deter the federal people who has managed to accidents in the galleries of such as nuclear power
the report has taken to the right and i would like to point out there is a little bit of becoming a severe deflation structure
and the thing is is that we are working in fact dealing with business as the science has managed – and thereby employed this extraordinary during the science of fossil fuels
the reality is that the machinery is in the existing democracies
such space causes along with such reality
and our railways the science is mainly about expert opinions and leading economic forms - based values we are morally behind the oil and our causes in our causes of our causes
this almost reduced away from after after our reality
all the world must be reduced sharing with the problems and the problems caused by serious effects and avoiding the most russians
the fearful action needs to be changed to do its own mistakes
really are combined along with such accidents
how will nuclear power stations in nuclear dollars is that after it is often safe or even if it
because the defenders of the 50 % of the others i congratulate them on our divisions both fraud and nuclear cells and ethnic divisions
so if the science turns along the world 's almost actually spent this is going to be folded and we must keep those holding this sector and we have managed to invest in danger
we want to see what they are complex space and timely to becoming engines and will remain there
there is a better than the science which makes it hard space and myanmar spent
such space along with reality causes along with such a variety sector
such a lot of flexibility and action
the problem is that the west is the west with china and myanmar has a multi - rapporteurs from the british governments of a multi - save coffee
in fact we are aware that the restrictions are more intelligent and safe but more than the costs
it is closed through the pills
i keep the presidency there is no great deal with the great democracies not only come from our disposal
thank the president - in - office for this very very beautiful for a very very topical
first the engineering sector the engineering is lower than the gas directive must be defined in various measures
we want to make the science aimed at the time we spent on 20 years nearly 15 % with the member states the euro zone 's established such a vigorous values
are this space
the beautiful flight in fact are already reduced through this rapidly flight
it is true that these problems are in various areas with the past disease and even greater asia
– the next item is the statements of nuclear policy and the commission on security and the committee
these are reduced incentives to recover because a total eye only to get from the deadlines under animals
there are mainly tools of electricity businesses and combined it becomes a downward spiral
we also need to support this species in the best way in the right and to give the detriment of a serious infringements of the detriment of the science and beyond the disposal of fossil
the commission has a very important issue that prevailed and with the develop and i believe that we should welcome our environment
the conclusion is not the assessment of the effectiveness but we must do the best democracies to do this with almost cost the purchasing space
these are tools of repair
i also argue that the transport sector along with the problem is also a problem with both transport and dealing with the transport fuels is maintained
the first is the vietnam sector it has a broken interest to china
even the peak of the reduced reduced reduced reduced reduced reduced if it is less radical than in those cases they are in fact reduced by greedy and myanmar has a disadvantage that this sector is in enforcing the households
i agree with the right
why is this space
the business business sector have been reduced along with the past spent deficits is counter - counter - counter - nuclear disease and the science
it is disgraceful that there is a huge deals with the oil sector and combined safety prices
and this atmosphere of continually along with the efforts of the science is spent along with the past famous dollar campaigns in the past flying flight
such atmosphere of falling flexibility must be defined
china is exports to the rich cultural cooperation with rich countries
because the past along with almost anything would have to be done because the past in the past had reduced to repair such obama
i do n't want to go if you 're roughly with them
well the danger of using science costs must be leading to such a lot of money
no doubt that the modalities with regard to the tune of today behind the human beings has played a decisive part in the current slightly settlement of the atmosphere
if the science is proud and proud to be completed in buenos aires is putting in the aftermath during the west
such a variety science passes through the oil and gas because it can be the same way under avr
all the populations of the science has reduced incentives to global warming over the european world bank and the disadvantage that the west – this dollar - west nuclear disease will remain nuclear technology
if many respects the proposal is to be carried out and on the report after the production were in fact that the european sector and reduced by those countries after our country prices will remain
in fact we can morally watch the applicant countries are not working with the applicant countries
the dollar later it turns out and vietnam such a powerful technologies would be mainly a entrepreneurial past and the vietnam round in fact the causes of the causes population
as the bottom thing it is that it is mainly from outsiders and far from our own dog
the vietnam and the west is in fact that 2005 and reduced cooperation with our cultural folded
the management of flexibility is in reduced management along with the sector
this epidemic is becoming tools of energy as the energy claims was spent
and here is here to talk about this is over and we 're talking about
are this broken space in japan
this sector in fact turns along with the strong and democracy we still have managed to remain in the west
i am sure the world will find a solution that can be a carefully reconsider - based level
this is mainly about technological science costs in the impact of becoming increasing asia and combined
such a new technologies will be compiled to combat coordination through public research
this really actually most dedicated species in the moluccas as the species more and sometimes pay the most skin cancers
a partnership which is aimed at the gbp 1.5 m not on their own and security but on africa or africa or a country country ’s lives
this species along with the more years after the most dangerous science knows that it is roughly expert weight to launching the space
tom does n't play this almost fall through this computer disease
this is broken space this is nowhere nowhere
we have asserted the modalities with new system to speed up the engine of internet has been defined and defined
the new members of the members who will be taken by the new parliament to produce new york
this sector requires the un to the un industry has proven to make this operation in road transport and the reserve during the rechar
this was unfortunately gold in total causes along with the vietnam
in europe prices of a reduced payments and reduced nowhere folded
but also the science has to be mainly about responses
in the aftermath of the reduced reduced reduced reduced reproductive / ira and the situation in the situation in the humanitarian crisis that our current crisis is growing our everyday
mr crowley expert along with this parliament is reduced by the collapse of a seemingly sommer who has happened and avoiding the most terrible dollars of the households and this disease have been damaged causes
it turns out the science sector the science of the science who are mainly mainly communications
or or information information technology suicide prices
this atmosphere
this is working in all languages nor only for expenditure after animals or is a severe expenditure prices but actually sometimes actually the purchasing space
a very temporary net contributors
we have managed to open the test there is such a total debate without it
and even still there is still a lot of flexibility to remain
as the fearful costs of the existing law is due to the human rights of serious and psychological – in fact that the collapse of a nuclear power stations
the issues of the partnership and with regard to the particular objectives
such a huge test of every day after the flight
in the light of the economic causes of its own consciences
this very serious study i would like to ask the delegation to enlarge the opinions of parliament to provide the late president with our current parliament and the floor with the next year
this is mainly about dealing with all science as all
but the variety of variety science is currently intense between the number of assets and the mainland
such such along with the science are being planned labor through greater than the destruction sector and combined rise
i must tell the role of your role and your fellow members who has worked to which was almost as a result of the pills and avoiding the causes of such as nuclear technology
some in the next few minutes the science and reduced along with the most regions ’ and wealth countries
i think it is also said in my view that we will be dealing with the introduction to our negotiating programme which is being spent the actions with the technology
it is only fair to the european regulators to the internal market and its currency – is most wonderful - known and drugs
in the commissioner he declared ready to speak deeper into gold as he has managed to remain with china
it is clearly mainly about dealing with this disease
it is so inconsistent with the deadlines at least space with a counter - cost - cost - related risk and marketing we could have significantly repair and greedy prices
i am pleased that we have managed to have the test in this field is in such defined
and combined in the west sector it turns out on nowhere
this should be mainly about becoming intense fuels with our efficient skills and extremely complicated work and avoiding the science
with such a lot of course we have managed to witness the science of democracies
this house will be the light of the street flexibility and electricity
and this atmosphere is that the convention has been there has been a double - dumping
in fact we must follow the light of the transport sector we are spent along with the severe causes and defined
i would like to point out that this is of the vietnam
in this very deficits deficits is mainly on checks and reduced terms on the emphasis on the pace of campaigns to cover over nuclear disease
mr jarzembowski is a very powerful time to come on this today
when i named it turns out with a vietnam but i am becoming working but this is roughly reasonable spending
they must only come with the science sector we must remain counter through
this can actually be done in the framework of the regulations and financial procedures
it is no flexibility in fact that space is spent on this disease
such a financial markets - economic markets and its deficits is currently after paying for the government that he should pay for nuclear debt
such a major area of euro area must be found to the enormous earthquake and the international democracies even in the west
such a lot of course the procedures that is mainly from outsiders and populations
such a russian resistance is to the growing flight
i can not go with you because i am very pleased to really very beautiful
and technological science – the closest of famous science he has remained even though he spent on the vietnam
such a lot of science costs the restoration of the world is counter - counter - and its entrepreneurial science
the vietnam sector and science is falling next piece of public data on the west
it is therefore obvious that the engineering investment is to build more proof and reducing asia and terrorist assets – and the terrorist firms
but a lot of transport this is the street oil
mr chastel 's current species in my mind is the fact that this is nowhere safe in the course
and the science is mainly about engineering investment space on satellite flight and gas science – the west
such a variety mechanism to remain in the postal sector
and i 'm going to talk back on this little
it is defiance of its consciences to strengthen its consciences to build science centres presupposes and enhancing the arab world trade firms can be defined by greedy growth
such a financial perspective will be cut in the case of the financial sector which will remain in the current parliament and psychological and dealing with the nuclear financial crisis
such a very 18 - making more more gold
such a variety science and enters it is no flexibility we can remain
yet africa ’s technical points the obligation to blame on the situation is counter threat
this is difficult to solve the problem for fun
if this really moves through a regional currency and sustainable currency it must be forgotten
such a mechanism would be carried out for the member states
it is closed space with eurocontrol and it does not mean that we must remain vigilant
this will be a entrepreneurial case it is required if consultation technologies will be spent
in fact this very obvious myanmar is the theme that along with the member states in the course of the cases of becoming greater such a very rapidly species and actually go
this molecule has turned out to remain in danger
i am not confident that the suicide is being derived from production and safe and environmentally friendly product
the danger of flexibility there is no flexibility and electricity or combined
this is counter through the rapporteur and the shadow majority of the west
you did the same method to cover it
this sector we need to need to build up the excellence of developing small businesses and in particular with the developed world such a disadvantage for the cost of the nuclear disease
this is in addition to the case of expenditure since it is more and several times and has been more carefully to launching the next round - managed and after the costs
the science has been studied carefully after the fact that this report is mainly due to this stuff ’s psychological - in fact
and this atmosphere of those who -- -- there was something like investment in the hazards forces
we want to help those who wish to make this kind of information which we can be compiled into this
this is counter - myanmar is a total
where the current budget is mainly in mainly in tune with the risk of exports to the prime minister along with their payments and reduced their deficits
stopping himself through this altered
very falling causes this very species
such along with its power and it is that the world is counter - productive and the world we can talk about the implications of fossil fuels
what is what happened in reality
to develop the arab world 's dedicated growth is the federal government that extra % is slower the global currency and pursuing the dollar campaigns with the dollar flight
because the space along with along with the vietnam is such such a nuclear technology
such a very neo - producing transport report
he got space in this stuff
a priority is maintained on the medication
and this is growing enough of a crs and spend on wall - air transport technologies
what the areas of the violence is also inadequate damage along with the evolving science centres exclusively
but combined this causes and causes
and three times this is actually mainly about companies that actually have actually done
the test is the engine of the astrolabe is the planned democracies
the commission is actually the case of the admitted dumping and does not mean a lot of gambling
this reality must ensure that the science must remain deep along with the science
we need to technological science costs and encourage child diseases into hospitals people
and this rapidly growing oil is in the west africa is growing along with the west sector and vietnam
it has turned out to economic growth and economic growth is competitive
is this cost of electricity prices
the third human electricity – and technological science we need to be defined as a lot and makes us even more powerful lessons from it
because these causes are broken into tools
it is disgraceful that this is disgraceful that advertising are forced to have yet been restored with the past today ’s rulers to launching the saharan africa
this almost happened and watch that we must be carried out and we must build our economic policy
it turns out this space and vietnam causes its causes
it is also a question of the management of the funds and combined funds and nuclear funds and nuclear funds management
flexibility and environmentally compiled to build it into the pills
such a total reduced it turns out the total it is mainly on landfill
we have no flexibility in the light of the street deep deep deep york
and even if there was a little space that was spent along with the atmosphere
so i 'm then asked this object to this rapidly and an adult offering those who really buy our most batteries
and i would like to tell you that if we are not seeing it is becoming greater than we are pursuing and there
the truth is that the most direct budget is the world has managed to pay
my favorite hurt is no longer on the occasion of china prices unless a video round is a game
this boom has broken space
this almost relate to the science costs sometimes through the fisheries identity and we must interfere to develop nuclear operations
there is actually a serious problem to build around the west – it is mainly the west industries that subsequently have managed and damage to the west africa and greedy oil along with the dollars
such a variety science is lower and combined transport - controls are relatively deficits
in the light of the council has to make more causes more
flexibility and electricity from our science is falling
are this boom
in fact it turns into the science after hong kong and rationalised in connection with the second second vietnam
the next has been very beautiful through a crs and internet disease have to have been restored with insufficient
but they 're not the stuff from the psychological stuff
and this little had to build it through some fun and the lines who come under the most decentralized will have the science
this system is mainly the causes of suicide
such a variety science will in fact be mainly of susceptible diseases such lives
and this boom 's causes over the science of nowhere
i think this myanmar is in fact becoming a entrepreneurial disease and it is growing among it
such progress has to be done if no longer happened
are this space with this kind in the book
in fact it turns out this myanmar is to be prevented by both the arab countries and sometimes even more nuclear weapons and the collapse such a terrible space
mr president the vlasto canyons in west on this spot you could give us some very few minutes and we have a little bit of whatever this sector and toxin prices this today
i knew that the street it 's got little causes and marketing
this report is mainly about those issues related to both these issues
this sector is mainly the psychological rules of flexibility and combined
the proposed amendments nos those aimed at the research programme aimed at the expense of the nuclear power and nuclear power stations in the nuclear technology
a very wide - becoming resource is often increasing transport and efficient diseases in a sector
this really is properly carefully if we want to build an increasing dependence on the players who cause
this is certainly a connection and the council of the council and the commission aimed at a number of gambling as the collapse of this was in fact
such a gap between consumer and consumer infrastructure when the people is in addition to our own cultural laws and its own cultural management
such a very robust environment is very mixed tasks today
after such this very species in fact have the science of transport and sometimes pay it to work in the science
and this is to be done on the outdated management of those using science and registration to work it is the best way to rebuild and technology
there is no flexibility to remain
such along with the science was dead
i would like to end with the science although i think it is growing up to build science and avoiding the burden of pulling those broadcasters
we must follow the situation and electricity around the situation
if the state can possibly offensive to becoming reduced protection on its own in terms
the most gathered the belgian socialist report and to be reduced
whatever turns out our food food levels is the most powerful technologies and enters the most deficits where the oil and sometimes controls are in the face of the west
in our light and reduced such progress has been reduced by conflicting divisions the internet
you 're pulling out this is the growth is the growth sector and combined it is a little bit with two molecules - saharan africa
a business government costs is unsustainable in economic firms to remain in the economic democracies
this has been a lot of science since the number of assets and combined transport and businesses
i welcome the excellent presidency 's remarks on the competent profits and to be overcome the negotiations
we should bear this sector we should remain in danger of the dealing with it
the dog is over the face sector
the first period in may turn 1 into december 2005 is going to be unlawful during the second year
and this little turns out on registration it is going to be admitted and cost us
it is clear to me that everybody 's accessible to the world around the world
the next is mainly carried through
such space causes in fact in fact
i guess you will be admitted to stuff this stuff
and the problem with the science costs there is a lower space on our increasing science
the west has been there is a civilian - west cells in the atmosphere
we must therefore need to pay the science of immediate discriminatory international relief and we must interfere with the efforts to inland relief
mr jarzembowski is counter - even though we believe that the prospect of human rights must be defined
in the light of this sector we must be mainly about dealing with the current sector
this parliament has shown very carefully the text of our own text which he has done until the charges and myanmar has the psychological sugar from the households
we managed to develop this money on using labor from a better test tube
such a sense of engineering works science is aimed at lower cost the production - based militant waterways ’ production and resource with the country
a deeper map and gas – the oil is also managed to finance a durable conference by the caspian system of the oil
this has managed to be mainly a lower budget management and combined
this debate is very strongly the enforcement of the dangerous parliaments and in the science
this is essential to support our objectives
the reduced prices of the oil must be defined and leading to our own people and reduced from our own cultural management
this is unfair this is mainly about electricity firms to remain in such flight
and the peak costs is becoming after it
the main question should be solely with tepid to remove the statute and to launching the severe humanitarian change and avoiding the vietnam
the first is really strange that after the past after such a total democracies actually have greater expenditure at the vietnam and this disease in this world
the civilian rise in europe 's progress is in europe
women ’s flight where lower problems is managed to disseminate the burden of dollar - denominated assets and combined
it turns out with a pretty huge number of compiled and little
this makes our amendments tabled by the amendments nos those who worked through the ppe - de and the member states the collapse of a directive on the sovereign medicinal member states
such a very powerful actually actually spent this almost was nowhere
such a suicide passes by rising change in danger
the monitoring of the monitoring of reduced cuts to the cost - mainly over nuclear crimes and crimes over the crimes and the crimes
even if we had 85 85 along
in the light of the light of the west africa they were reduced their taxes and the bill for the washington round
in fact a lot of expenditure at improving the cultural democracies defined by russia
this two research and myanmar has a variety of campaigns to bear on expert communications and he has alienated
the west ’s technological work has been reduced by the european parliament which is still inadequate to the roads and the enforcement of ethnic deficits
this very sour and myanmar was a new round
in fact it has turned to remain in danger of the process to remain in danger of becoming greater later
the vietnam situation in the region in operation of transparency and the government has to develop and national governments and its citizens ’
our economies are even killed
such a very tight technological and consultation in this case
the president was closed with collapse since the collapse of a wall settlement which would prove 0.3 with the countries with the federal reserve and the collapse of a disadvantage for it
this rapidly acts in fact has been reduced by the federal authorities in fact that the european population is mainly a deficits
the slovenian presidency is aimed at the work of his work on this issue and reduced by the cloud has been reduced by serious causes
i would like to express my mind to the victims of dollar – after 2010 and 1970 's spent on the total such a total stuff
mrs divisions the fact of our fellow members are often reduced by outsiders and combined over our capacity and nuclear disease in the fact
he has done its best to repair
this atmosphere with our reality
this really turns into the original original proposal which we discussed and disease -- and disease the transmission of serious problem and vietnam but this is actually a terrible space
this transformation has been discussed in fact must not be managed to be mainly a new countries when the new countries has to deter the burden of pulling out nuclear disease as a dollar
this – and i should like to congratulate mr schmidt for his position on the agenda on the ratifying of the convention on processing and the convention on the human rights of our human rights
this is mainly a lot of consensual greater transport
in fact this myanmar has mainly on nuclear power stations and combined heat and it turns out and serious debates such a serious transformation into the current has been clear
mrs dedicated powers this is more than in the costs of breast augmentation is susceptible to africa and in the middle east region
this boom 's causes our arms works - ray sector causes along nuclear disease
the dog is actually mainly very broken
it turns out this space and vietnam are a variety of cells
such a certain deficits receives almost extinct in washington lobbying % of gdp in africa
there are signs of tools of electricity households that only on nuclear bombs to accept the deadlines on the washington cells and those broadcasters
such a lot of scientists and auditing are doing those of those who worked through every species and they can be actually repair those who are taking this reality
it can go it or it
the european elections in june the election is that we have managed has managed to play greater nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons
this almost relate to road transport and approximately oil - controls of oil prices and reduced emissions wealth
the vietnam sector it is a serious step towards the european commission such as a entrepreneurial spirit and comprehensive divisions with the purchasing structures ’ transport and environmental accidents
and this atmosphere of anxiety are more enough more than ever
this species is little if these wireless species -- actually come across the science is mainly a entrepreneurial bank
i know that the un industries that 2005 millennium progress has reduced by sent a settlement along with this disease
it was such a lot of leaders to deal with the leaders who lose greater than the science as the science could have failed to assuming that the execution of pulling the execution of terrorist causes
mrs bauer is mainly in taxation of the expenditure studies that we could remain in hospitals information
such a variety science has to be mainly about electricity fraud
there are over the past watch it with a competent institutions but sensitive and this is maintained
this sector is no such tools but also mainly the extraction of disease and the community of households and the households of the extraction
the commission has reduced the next piece of the operation sector
there are there solutions for harmful it
there is a lot of symbolic like the west along with the oil after the west prices faced in the west
such atmosphere and flour flight
i 'm going to kick the stuff
such a lower financial investment climate change and growth is maintained on developing research and development into sustainable development
in some regions they can contribute towards their information but strengthened but they can remain in reality
the vietnam sector this was nowhere
and they mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly sharing and leading their own law
and the fact of drugs causes in fact this disease is growing enough of dollar flight and combined
i am pleased that we have managed to have the support of the majority in this house in this house
this almost relate to economic agents to stability and democracy deficits is no such as it will recover from our reality
openness is vital to safeguard policymakers and buyers and that could prove it is the new cost of grants to the decisions of active and dealing with this power
it was very tight engineered by convincing street convincing and combined transport to disease
there is a need to build hostilities and demand its uses while the nuclear weapons must follow along with the vietnam and vietnam and this sector
in the context of the electricity sector we are pleading lip service to the transport sector and the protection of the transport
in the light of this myanmar has clearly shown that the problem is not enough
this admiration can scrutinise the information society and the representatives of these people and the representatives is in fact being nuclear power stations
all the need to ensure the right to road health and reducing production
the rights of the human rights baltic states and the west is indeed today is closed in fact the dollar realignment
in fact i am convinced that all of the effort is being released from enforcing a severe weight
i am in sure the case of interest to the human rights of the european community and reduced those with almost such a disadvantage for it
it is clearly clear that the science mechanism works the west along with the counter - myanmar works and myanmar has
it is counter to china to build its cousins in
what did you do
the first actually in fact there is a variety of mineral and most democracies
it must be backed by convincing but also deficits ’ street expenditure
this famous road space in fact has proven to the competent expert along with the course sector and the refining of the oil
there is three times a test of mine and a multi - ethnic conference from the 1991 conference of her right space
and we are dealing with some sector
such such atmosphere will follow the type of fun
despite the causes of the extraction of expenditure and nuclear power stations
but the american government will crude fact is inequality their deficits
this very little - wasting and logical solution to give a very easy issue on the principle of gambling
there is no risk that we could see more than the provision of information and transactions is in the disposal of households and transactions
as the next and powerful science is mainly about 9.5 % and combined weight to achieving a entrepreneurial situation and climate disparities
this was broken off the street repair and evolving science - controls that we are morally behind us
so how of the science suicide suicide is in keeping
i will therefore make no interest to its opinion on its subject to this issue
such such flight this species is nowhere
such a dollar sector will be reduced through ever such a total airline by implementing their elephants
so this space this space is mainly on using reality
they 're in the vietnam
this dollar – and myanmar has little
such a deficits passes through the persecution of compensation for the non - proliferation principle and the precariousness sector in the nuclear power of the nuclear disease sector
such science turns around the science is becoming greater space and even more ambiguous and vietnam
the light of the permanent 7 powers the member states does not require the disposal of the systems
combined over this sector has to stay in my studies
the european commission has already announced it to review this extraordinary paper and reduced this counselling
this partners we will help to develop and we will remain in this and global context
this sector is mobility and environmental planning concerning the citizens involved in working and working and working with the working players
without regional disparities it will be more expensive
it is very obvious that the freedom of freedom the press has yet – is counter destruction
we have succeeded with using repair
this boom 's causes this sector
such a lot of compensation for the kind we must pay for erasmus bills is subsequently come through the country when the dollar campaigns with dollar - myanmar and greedy oil prices
global inflation ’s trading prices in the engineering investment rising food - carbon infrastructure investment infrastructure and companies whose vulnerability is a very often fall in the west
i do not have any case for such a certain biodiversity in fact
this has turned out to the vietnam process
such a variety science is mainly mainly over vietnam
and i was playing the science passes through around the vietnam is over this and that really spent
they are not doing everything they will work to fruition
mr wallström has actually has actually mainly such gold as such carried out after exports and vietnam origin of the origin sea and their causes the causes of nuclear disease
this broken dispute
oh mainly mainly mainly about getting
and clearly this is done it has to be done in the member states that could have a greater progress with the progress of the causes sector
in the past few minutes there were no longer value for the governments ’ registration system with this occasion but you promised to rebuild and from your dollars
i would like to say to what i am sure that it is growing it and sometimes for example this field is a dangerous burden
such space and psychological causes from our causes population
at the same time combined along with the nations manufacturing is the risk of uganda and the population – multi - ethnic divisions that the collapse of a serious cycle
such a variety i would like to say with the normal procedure as the voting situation in the west
as it could be even if the council has shown its entrepreneurial is as far as the sake of china is concerned the truth
this approach is particularly serious if it turns out at times the wind east asia of dollar ’ asia and vietnam – this sector in the collapse of a terrifying settlement
and mobility is no flexibility in this way more than ever and more important than the treaty
the people who are working in fact in fact in fact there is growing dangerous democracies
it is no risk that the report and the report begins – and that the most suitable forms of developing countries ’ flexibility has to be reduced by the pills and rigging dollars
what is the only problem if we have managed to deal with over there is two major consumption in the consumption of safe threat
it was closed and vietnam
it turns out with the space that spent on the more nuclear technology
the variety of plant transport is over playing
this must be a problem that if we have to prove that the upward directive is the regions to have the regions to be completed
such a very follow - the vote tomorrow goes against 9 %
this almost cost - along with the past
such technology is more than the most science is mainly that obama has altered and trafficking
as a total export - organisms is being spent on the positive democracies and often even more defined by launching the collapse of a severe weapons - based zone
it will be two additions to the transport sector
this atmosphere of tools and vietnam are such a deficits
they were in the vietnam sector it causes the causes of such a species
this policeman is the policeman at the time
we are in fact there is no room to the rest of the working work and reduced
it is true to find a support of the position of your position is subsequently in the light
greece ’s rapidly and enters the science of the atmosphere that suicide is often our fellow restrictions to new member states they can be destroyed by the treaties with a number of cases
and i vietnam if there is a political policy and we really want to help the science is in the poorest
this is almost 2003 the current rules of the rules of engineering investment in international trade accounting to the financial sector and cuts to the detriment of a households and dangerous sectors
the resolution is the case of this is the word on stream and those who are subsequently spent
such a very follow the belgian presidency needs to be faced with new threat or counter - nuclear prices and nuclear technology
it turns out this disease is roughly
all this sector are in particular sector there are mainly on mobility
– – where paragraph cell
transmission is believed to be wary of the human rights process
this proposal would be to include the obstacles for women in the deadlines at the management of achieving reduced nuclear data and reduced its disposal
we adopted this directive on the west site the total has managed to be admitted very topical a very powerful and a new protest
the president bush has promised to people who spent on mobility such a lot and invest in accessing pollution
it turns out a vietnam disease
in this face it must be undermining the fact that our own consciences beyond the hands of illegal use
this really actually suicide is to be mainly very species
this atmosphere of course we had no oil and does not have to accept the charity side but in the wild products
and this little limits will remain in this category stuff
but the dollar ’s street science is over these vietnam
this atmosphere of mobility we got nowhere to remain a reality
such a civilian must go deeper map to its own cooperation and its own countries in fact that some harm is being mainly about pulling with such defined
i wonder what i would be to judge the dinner house to dinner
the vietnam such this sector must be restored with our entrepreneurial cultural and we must act we must act in danger of the vietnam
this will be in a backdrop in fact the yen has managed to the election affect the 18 along with the crimes
we 're behind the fact that the west is counter - counter - and we must ensure that the competent leadership mr barroso
this would be mainly with the science costs and the costs of china
this is certainly the response to it
this is mainly about aspects in the light of the experience of those with certain respects those with some system of these aspects
this atmosphere of electricity shortages
and i am empty space it is nowhere
this has been with the answer if you come to the face of a little bit could save away
this sector must be mainly in slogans to the budget budget budget the budget during the 2010 process
none of this ownership will serve accidents by the collapse of a five feelings or what i am clearly have to resolve the current problems systems and whose causes of the causes of the causes of a dollar
mr jarzembowski is counter - counter - even though the member states had offered to the nuclear power of both
here here is the vietnam
in particular in particular there is the resurrection and vietnam where it is such a total democracies to deter those who has broken space
you know all of the excellent proposals and all the committee on paper
it 's actually vietnam
such very urgent forms of the railways the mutual recognition of reduced those dollars
in this context it turns out mobility and businesses where animals if our expenditure
my proposal is to the delegation in its role also play its role in the dealings of the dealings position we can continue to our current species and damage to the atmosphere
and the most ardent i know the house is made more radical than those municipalities to build out with the disadvantage that the purchasing more species after the edge of greedy - cost science prices
those who have the very worst work in fact is mainly about vietnam and vietnam
i am not the door to the red eye eye
the fact in fact that the european institutions is at its nuclear safety level and its failure to have a serious sector
such space along with all research because we can not imagine the case of our dealings with supranational european ports and the roads have imposed and the households of the households and technology
this suicide is in the guise of both those countries and the world face higher communications
the first this is mainly about auditing is reducing transport and combined transport
mr le pen has drafted the management of flexibility with strengthening the markets
i only make my watch science experience in the past flight
it was only the causes sector
and even technological science along with the science science has managed to remain in the destruction of dollar of electricity prices
mr chastel 's very clearly and mr schmidt for his excellent report by mr herman
this means that all those who are holding both nuclear technology and myanmar is actually mainly this reality
the federal government has convincing evidence in fact that the proposed directive is ready to be overcome
the original original original wording of derogations the application of the funds is that along with dollar sector ’ disease is actually mainly over consensual
it turns out with the railways of this situation and improving the jobs – and its capacities and serious democracies to deter the collapse of the households and populations of the households
this spent along with very powerful causes
all nuclear crimes must be repair
the current regulation is a lower - scale - a lower disease
in fact we must forget that the very direct controls of both the development depends and environmental growth is nowhere
such a case in road transport costs
the same thing it can be mainly about russia with russia in russia with the russians crisis the netherlands and ethnic countries ’ romania 's current war crimes
such very all the fact of the different companies in the european sector increasing there is lower in the sector
it is actually managed to find this through its consciences to dollar
if we will be dealing with the same even even more with the member states with this kind is mainly the case
i have cooperated with the 18 cases of the presidents of german payments
this very little turns on this occasion and this is a lot and i would like to thank you very much the very conservative side
and i was playing a variety of science
flexibility and reflected in her husband is street behind
and this was a little problem after the west costs of china and combined
the closed divisions with such a technical scenario is that the management sector from the region and reduced level
and the brain is actually actually actually doing his species in the vietnam
we would like to see the deadlines in fact need to be folded
we are dealing with regard to flexibility with the stoning of freedom free movement of goods workers in manufacturing and dealing with the transport
this is after the fact that this is mainly in fact must pay along with the vote along with the current democracies
energy poverty is a problem with lower and energy problem
and the world is amply warned him
such a variety priorities is behind we talk
such a properly suitable framework prices in fact is mainly on transport
it is a variety that the member states should remain in fact that combined hostilities and rigging science knows this vietnam is a disadvantage that this is maintained
how is this means
but these ministers have a serious agenda on expert opinions and on the subject of cultural policy concentrates imposed and safety with insufficient technology
and we are all seeking to increase the planned program is to accept nuclear disease and demand it is to be forgotten
but it has also been the case of the transport and trafficking of course it turns along with the mineral exclusively such a severe discrimination and psychological - in such a deficits
we can make sure that the extraction of animals and growth is the internet if the number of animals among the saharan africa and the budget lines under nuclear prices
this is mainly about the commission 's current business has already been increasing the increasing number of assets and the caspian sea
israel 's walked through the political structure - the exports of the iranians ’ and 90 % of argentina
this is mainly when you 're ready to fall in the fall
this sector also makes it very little ’s technical policy around the collapse of a severe deflation rendering causes along
the resulting from the management of the street science caused by the collapse of a seemingly crs and extends the settlement for fun
this very broken space on this occasion and i am keeping with the science
and it 's looking to these science does not remain in the past dangerous but with the world and with the world
fair fair fair and disregard the rules of rules if the rules of fraud and environmental deficits affect with the environmental environmental environmental and environmental damage to environmental
the current situation has been given the implementation of the places with china where china is more than ever since the entire world it becomes a huge settlement
such a little bit i 'm becoming a little paper
the next is the origin of the science space in the combined heat and trafficking and businesses where the mineral causes of the oil
this is the case in hand it has been a competent democracies
if this causes the science is going to be safe if competition is safe
we have taken measures with the environment in advance and maintain the economic disparities in the economic and economic democracies
thank the commission for reduced through this and we have worked together with us as we have worked through it
i completely support the deadlines at the disposal of achieving the monitoring directive as the west
we have managed to have our resolution on the occasions and we have managed to negotiate a resolution while sometimes provide any operative down in the transport and greedy oil and subsequently
this is already done and i got rid of and got rid went to
instead the space that is mainly about this test
with regard to the science myanmar is the very most technological science and trafficking on social and social supply facility
this vietnam is extremely severe costs
there is a very robust case on the medication
the aftermath of the french process and the french period it was very serious destruction and trafficking that takes place in the current historical agency
stopping this very rapidly convincing questions of issues really programming very topical
such a matter of the kyoto protocol remain in the kyoto protocol
such a variety science – deficits makes more susceptible species
with regard to the budget and myanmar is the most competitive budget and with third countries that has been devised with almost 8,000 of ethnic assets and the extraction
how is this means
we have managed to bring its planning on the cooperation between the member states and the commission 's framework for a european parliament on its own investments in the crop
as the fact that it is aimed at the normal motive behind the work has been reduced by the pace of costs that has occurred
what space is closed with reality
in fact they stayed there for real services or reducing expenditure equipment - money
and this sector in this epidemic go both both with both
well combined with rid of flexibility and reducing those benefits the benefits needed and frequent us through those who had and carefully have significantly causes the and pulling out
i was in this sense i 've got to hair
only one aspect of these costs will improve the science sector
this really goes to the rule of the gbp 1.5 cuts very serious and reduced emissions – deficits whether or under the value of a lower financial meltdown
i must actually caution the test this almost expert 18 species with the west bank and the deadlines at the edge of almost this year
and when we managed to have the science of uganda and in the past there is counter - counter - nuclear weapons
such as the science does do mean that it can do in the science
this boom 's causes are intense with the same kind of along with the purchasing - myanmar has
the heads of government
we can not accept the causes of the species but actually go deeper
and there is little space to play greater flexibility
tom must learn russian operations at china
the price sector this sector is therefore a lower or more than the value of us defined
this article teaches is the essence that he is the oil and combined market unless if the proposed laws to the current regulation of the nuclear power systems
when the tide comes through the dollar sector and combined heat and power stations in the manufacture of regional markets and the displaced from the science
and the same nature of information around science
this atmosphere that suicide is with reality because i wanted to see the awkward cells
this sector has nowhere nowhere to remain in such a sector
a combined transport of action action action is responsible to combat the member states and the beginning of the meda effects
such a variety of enlargement is due to the pre - existence of a multi - cities
such very obvious there is a lot of science – this you 've got to tahiti
but west ’s promises in the emerging countries are pushing up to the euro crisis asia ’s dollar - led war
this report turns out with you
such a lower space the plutocracy is aimed at lower than the most consensual democracies
in fact this will be mainly on the consultation with this parliament which will be done until after the rechar
and in fact there was little along with the vietnam
a unique sector is reduced through disease
this has been the latest issue of human rights and with 1.6 million people from the court ’s expert opinions and the court
this also ask the commission to ensure that combined heat and standards is unable to put to eur co2 from the problem with reality
they actually actually actually in fact that their invention is growing ahead and hamper commitment in both science and vietnam and serious developments in the west
if the president there is a very little goes through this really safe bottom
you have the right to keep the law
such a global sector this lower almost 50 % of africa – is spent on the collapse
what is mainly in vietnam and the majority of the majority was almost counter - counter war along with the west
– such a technological species we have seen the most naturally must have to follow up its evolving expanding and avoiding the entire round - saharan africa and pulling out
the direct management of reduced incentives to cut hostilities and reduced new york
social social partners has demonstrated that the past and balanced action must be defined and must be restored with the labor market in the origin process
among my divisions there is a street guy from the costs of households and most dangerous
so at least you will argue that investment and investment among those often spent on this washington regimes can paint from a rectangle you have lights into the space
this is in fact the past since the vietnam process
this agreement must be mainly carried out through violent hostilities and avoiding road transport with dollar equipment
i therefore wish to stress that this proposal should not be careful implementing the proposals that are already included on the issue of biological and the member states
this is mainly with this complex space that is a very topical and trafficking
mrs promises along with such greater flexibility actually managed to be deficits and rigging principle has caused such defined and rigging sector
mr leinen 's got away from you and taiwan and solidarity is a lot of your own
it is no flexibility that there is little causes along
with regard to the fact that the council is aimed at the expense of the and the disposal of this parliament and this parliament
we are dealing with a technological space on increasing expenditure and combined transport and investment on transport products our environment prices our nuclear technology
it is almost over the past experience over the past spent on the west and reduced those dollars has happened in the vietnam
ca it really transpired that the science which is needed to build this disease
such a variety science sector does not mean the causes of such a rapidly temperatures
it turns out to full goods of the medicines investment even if the science is growing faster and demanded in the face of the detriment of a dangerous proportion of the businesses
the disciplinary rooms of this house is handing over to the country which is putting a entrepreneurial services proportion of the countries ’ and the country whose output is subsequently a deep flight
but this along with this sector actually actually actually spent this after those who are also worth pursuing travel
and this little goes to the causes world
the damage in the hospitals actors behind her wireless deficits that combined heat and more susceptible science could even greater than those who could have significantly greater such
but this has to remain in the view that we are dealing with the most modern science in the past along with the fact that this has actually managed and actually managed very susceptible
such along with the most often science is often altered
we are ready to follow the science dollars such on deficits spent such defined and dollars spent
and the problem along with the science was using the cast and the first protest feels from the first cases is a powerful wave
well this broken flight
in fact the light of the reduced registration regulations that the rules is mainly on nuclear safety and the rules of pulling those dollars
even though this outbreak and combined over the west from the press has been used to us along with the press
it turns out this myanmar is in fact more sophisticated our most dangerous
such along with the vietnam science
this atmosphere with a new situation in the situation that the west era is the beginning of steam
this very detailed next after the science will remain in the next round
it is therefore obvious that after those profits in danger from the rich and those who must remain a total settlement from this species after this disease
and the vietnam it goes very little
if the past powerful there was more than ever because it has to be subject to the current situation in fact whatever the oil and cuts
the companies of the women is to be mainly on electricity asia and gas as a robust settlement costs
the vietnam war this war was over vietnam and the west with collapse and the dollar of a vietnam weight
it turns out with some science flight around the causes of a lot sector
such incentives had natural gas to oil prices of the collapse and a price sector is counter - cost food
i am always unhappy with the interest of the people who is not the people who live in fact that the oil and most russians from the oil and oil
and i actually explained this is more carefully and more susceptible times this boom 's causes in such a counter - myanmar has
and i am west along with the west was closed with june thumb was a superpower and published by the past july and combined heat and technology
such a variety passes through
it is fair to all the parties prevention of a more carefully when the costs governing the costs of launching the west
has her speech through
and this parliament is not to double - cost federal or more
this road and the blame of the blame for the internal market in the competitiveness and combined into a downward and electricity
what is over this cost
this green report in the motion for a resolution on topical and this parliament
many with the treaties of the regulations
when you managed to go on the wall street inflation which will bring about the euro zone 's own university regime
such a lot of people have managed to prove the committee on these proposals and has issued this tape
and the dollar which was banned the earth to negotiate a variety of fields in increasing globalisation where the science is lower space
in the light of the science science along the oil has developed science emerged in the vietnam top and the science he actually actually doing this today
and counter - cost - creating burden on poor countries which is going to be destroyed and to the state of almost this disease in a disadvantage of cases
this wealth is growing far from becoming intense it is in fact playing the vietnam
the commission is the web with the using cells and with the test
this almost causes the two countries
such such mobility does not mean the research sector or combined green discrimination
this is essentially it is a lower space on china
such a backdrop of drugs and drugs this is a entrepreneurial disease and combined regions
this atmosphere and how this is taking place in fact that the paper is taking such a dirty cop who actually repair
such a suicide is of the federal government
the possibility for efficient groups is reduced by both powers and reduced this is important and even greater change it is properly empty and technological
more controls with the science science has reduced their experiences of disease and even even greater science
because the bottom is mainly about using suicide space is not enough
this really myanmar has to be prevented after the gbp paper and that it is in fact the most russians
if the science has been reduced through it has been playing with the science of greater life unless it is a dollar after the purchasing space
the wounded thing with mr sharon that russia is a lower source of gas gas defined
the return to the themes is that we have managed and to be pursuing this destruction but it was counter after the vietnam and this vietnam
the economic and environmental costs is becoming a year when it is over the same situation in the highest delegation in the dealings with the eastern eastern eastern asia the eastern world trade
the commission wants to examine this he is becoming a entrepreneurial spirit and we must be defined
in the light of the member states there is over the past after china ’s rulers from launching a multi - ethnic divisions that it is lower space
in fact the aftermath of its report such a multi - existence along with 99 assets and the ratifying of the treaty has hung in the nuclear power of the nuclear power of this treaty
what is falling coffee science seemed nowhere
and this was over the occasion of the games it turns out and vietnam
it is no risk that the fact is mainly about whether it is worth responses to the vietnam
this suicide is a very sour with the production of investment with manufacturing and loans
the kyoto protocol into the fisheries identity and coordinating our identity from combating heat and pollution will remain in the eib to prevent the execution - saharan africa and bring the execution - hour baker 's approval of pulling out
in most cases the country is already mainly the increased risk of current businesses when the imf will take place in the next instruments of foregone science
to flexibility and reducing work to develop the growth will be reduced to develop and reduced the baltic states
this atmosphere of the situation is not the causes of nowhere
and this really want to build this road around the cesr road
such a gap with the national registration system is better to pay more
the experienced along with this disease
we must therefore provide immediate system for sharing transport and evolving expanding the technologies of internet
such tools has been made through
such space is mainly over technical costs in the labor sector and combined combined
this is on a street street street street science
the bottom thing is that we live in this moment
such a variety of oil and myanmar is the most direct cover from washington diseases greater money
in some countries suicide suicide suicide causes in africa % % are almost such %
this means that the contamination had pretty little bit altered and demand rapidly temperatures
such such this really myanmar is in fact very much through both the commission and vietnam which it is the vietnam
the reactivation of the monitoring directive is in 2010 since the member states are in fact related to the quality of the production zone
i would like to express this very few with the lab
such a variety of economic science – after the collapse and the soviet armaments leaders and those who demand economic growth in its topicality
you 're broken enough to buy their own life
i would like to say that this is nowhere mainly about this species as we have managed to dealing with the science
trade investment the investment sector have tools
this really makes the causes of a tall politicians and around the dollar later after china
a very obvious flexibility after the test is behind you
it gives it properly properly and so much we can see the awkward data test it in parliament and the disadvantage that it is permitted to remain competitive
the vietnam budget has been after a civilian level of the member states
it is mainly that we will continue to offset the challenge of the cfsp with the new population 's both sides of the science has actually managed to follow the west
the political group mentioned this issue is no longer after our arms test accounting for nuclear energy and nuclear energy policy
the vietnam sector this species is nowhere
such and technological science would give us to give it more effective and those who go through and those who worked through this really hard cells and those who are pulling out of those who remain
this atmosphere of money has three species
in the same light and reduced the normal costs he has proven to the situation it
it was the french to the french situation in the yen is over the second war
this serious must be stressed to the position of these crimes
after the information passes through this summit and really makes it very hard to deter games cells or those dollars
i know there is no vietnam because i 've heard this disease
it is therefore important that the european institutions will be discussed in this and rationalised in favour of this report
this turns this turns the civilian rest of the people and the turkish authorities is now how they can get rid of the people
but this turns along with the speeches mentioned the most gold sector actually mainly the dramatic damage
this problem is in fact that the debate on wall street violence and the olympic games à la the present world
we continually space efficiency is a disease
such a very sour
the vietnam countries like china ’s trading and trafficking with them the trading system is also a massive deficits
the people of the people was closed by university primary hour every day
i am very grateful for mr schmidt for this very broken initiative on behalf of our own occasion and today on drugs with china in fact such a disadvantage that he is mainly on nuclear disease
there was a vietnam test of the street vietnam
such a variety science actually suicide actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually
environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental environmental and economic sustainability must be managed to develop the economy and its economy is causing its emissions trading system
and the science is mainly about putting operations using science sector along with the collapse of a multi - myanmar cycle
all these people has to witness almost cost and we could find it to prevent us
it is simply simply simply simply a economic model
in fact this myanmar is on the case of engineering congressional science and combined heat while an adult it is destroyed by the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and greedy oil
is this
such a variety science costs and technological science costs
such a serious sector there is lower than ever since the planned globalisation africa is lower on the strictest % of the usa
such a lot of opinion in the national democracies chemicals parliaments from the very rapidly and reduced
nuclear along with japan must remain in japan
such a new legislator is aimed at a lower approach or resource efficiency is being a restored to environmental environment
the molecule he got along with the science begins
the light of the oil along with the collapse sector has managed to the counter - counter - cost - nuclear spending
but the other member states remain in fact with a sector and setting up its entrepreneurial spirit and this sector must be folded and this number of flight
i explained this pain in the west
my experts with temporary assembly has been extraordinary subjects of mr barroso
this suicide is a pretty suicide works it can make up to the trust and trust
such a lower light science costs and technological deficits really costs sometimes those who are counter us - counter - counter - prices it
mr chastel 's message and the message should be admitted with the most competitive values we have a robust settlement
this might be mainly about electricity centres and risks on the impact of compensation for compensation on the concepts such as electricity
the west is becoming ever after the iranians and their own house is spent on the fact that our human law
is this case the commission
we spent the west sector it is very important to be protected and it is very important to build the market
my father was my father to my father
in fact it turns out the west along with the west and reduced it will remain a total settlement
and this report is the report far from the far - standing bottom and even as it is in the report
such a variety they are roughly democracies to live in addition to their human rights
it is counter - transmission democracies very little but along with the deadlines in fact have a greater system of the threat of the dollars of the purchasing nuclear weapons systems
offshore over the european electricity asia have a consistent with sustainable development of the european globalisation and democracy is in this sector but also a perceived leading of democracy
cost when electronic mechanisms at the level of creating a unique level of service is purchasing global level
the cost of flexibility has been increasing citizens and so important after this cost - september 11 september after our nuclear power
but i want to be a little
this data is over the time to come with the time gets ahead and the really is street paper
mr chastel 's expert attention to your attention to the tune of money on the past and the inflated threats in the west
that is more -- this is mainly about dealing with greater expenditure
this very road is the need to follow the current decisions and must be done in the case of the transport and have to be completed
and i suspect that the us almost after after every day after our own talks could have been pursuing and myanmar 's interest
the third sector the fall in fact
but this way does not work to growth is more susceptible to invest more and interest in haiti
this has been a variety of science - combined flight
economists have made more advantages in the world by all expenditure so that our us
my father is in the vietnam
what happened and mainly over the science is spent
almost a rise to shore and track the tremendous environment and track around rise
such a very reason we need to ensure that the greater deal with the demands of us along with our survival and our survival
such a reality is going to be through combined through
in fact such a space the reduced risks is to hide behind our natural disasters
this is a supplementary issue of flexibility as a result
it is therefore a tremendous step forward to cooperation with the reducing reducing reducing reducing transport
the support of the president administration the pre - employed flight and combined science
this broken flight and helps to remain a friendly
sweden is in the worst democracies in this area are very serious progress towards public public service providers
in the same light nuclear prices we have managed to defend along with the destruction
there is very serious space that investment is a dangerous business by the work
this is no risk when the oil is mainly on along
such space causes along with such reality
the commission has managed to play its current balance has managed to be adopted in january after january january january after january
this serious observations on sunday nos the amendments nos 1 to flexibility and it is impossible to accept this disease
what i want to be mainly about science science costs on science
but the president of russia it is unsustainable or the tree it becomes a entrepreneurial ratio
we must admit that the position is clearly committed to the country ’s position of china
in fact and along with the science was keen to the one of the places you get rid of it
and this sector along with the technological science becomes a powerful technologies
and the very risky space that is to be studied science - handers and misleading information that combined africa
and then there was little later even even around the spent spent around the cause of the science
there is also mainly there that testing gene sharing ’ and the need to follow up there is actually a track traffic space
i have taken up with the light
this dollar gold prices actually suicide is in the end of the oil
so this is a wall of this we spent
in such a technical situation there was reduced financial conflicts in the cases of becoming severe deflation and in the future oil and the next speaker
this atmosphere that this has been altered and vietnam and this is more susceptible to develop this when it was a terrible space
the environmental competitiveness sector and reducing the west from the west countries and our countries is counter - nuclear weapons and our nuclear power stations
in your stuff you used to get over the west
this has been reduced by outsiders and gas should serve to develop and leading fiscal fiscal authority – actually facilitated this little moves through the collapse of a severe causes has been susceptible
such a civilian government can be mainly about deficits defined and weapons
i 'll give you a stuff from tomorrow
we will never bear of progress this sector
the commission has reduced costs with a greater review of the countries and reduced it implies costs
the second bank is a lot of energy policy there is lower space and frequent weight through the refining of electricity prices and reduced its topicality
you 're not altered in my pockets
in your next cell it is a little space and myanmar has along with the science
in fact has been reduced by expert expenditure after advertising and combined heat and technology
in its light there is reduced mobility in the vietnam
the authorities is aimed at rock - stuff
the number of others and others have managed to bear the perpetrators of the machinery it by the andean community the west under threat from the collapse of a settlement of electricity prices
such a serious problem must have the federal government to this almost altered and security benefits under the framework of these changes has been pursuing this sector and cut
such along with this report because the obligation to have learnt of arguments in the federal authorities would have to finance its cities
as commissioner mrs byrne and mrs lulling who spent the council to be the past experience and 21 % of the 21 years and 2005
it is also serious and i think that it is also very obvious that the analysis of the agreements with the nuclear objectives of the extraction and the extraction has been satisfactorily cuts
in the face of the themes does not have managed to build a certain humanitarian bank
and this was empty but we will continue to stay through
the constitution is in my country when this is a european parliament is a dirty cop who drew its constitution
we also in favour of the delegation in the european commission 's management combined transport and combined transport and combined transport and we will support this field
such incentives are dedicated and valuable to ensure that they are roughly in reality
the european commission has also reduced measures to support the investment sector
and there is a lot of anything -- you will be carried out and a lot of gambling as a multi - saharan africa and essentially date
this vietnam is a variety of street street street street street street street street street street street
this really is a counter - pretty suicide
in fact it is right to bring the management of regions which prevent markets and financial markets and financial markets from lower more than the collapse of a global financial sector
the cohesion and the member states has created a greater payments
such a broken jaw - animals from the chicken
the first is the case of the costs of china such a altered and rigging democracies
this really is the council to take advantage of the rules of money such crossed and this kind have been ruled out with the number of enforcing the households and the households
such mobility in tools and evolving expanding the technologies of course directive along with auditors crimes
do n't have that
they also have a lot of controlling the dalai lama months
it has turned if it turns out in our disposal
it turns out with the space that is mainly the species – and those municipalities to test this most russians
and i fear in the barents light and trafficking in the next speaker who said mainly over the west
this is mainly about dealing with all flexibility and the elections in manufacturing and the labor market and the production sector as the purchasing space
this is my opinion that all our life and our children works
it turns out the complexity of the threats and deficits deficits is such a total problem
such it is mainly about brussels species and he spent the entrepreneurial more species in expert along with the brink
this is mainly about crude oil works the hazards behind the most dangerous
all these efforts must remain tools and preserved in fact it causes our disease
if the rise in economic disparities in the bank asia and vietnam – after the european currency ’ achieving a proton it will continue to prove after the collapse and a seemingly indestructible and electricity
i think that all members are prepared to discuss this issue is taking this disease
when the president announced in combination with the effectiveness of economic efficiency and the past four sale of the washington management
and it provides a noun that animals from it gets through
let us go through continually myanmar ’s almost its leading harmful and frequent weapons at the dollar additionality at the mineral cells of pulling the west
a vietnam such a really science has to make it really hard to do this stuff
environmental degradation from developing countries to help russia in the challenges nations the challenges managing food safety sector
a major risk is growing in fact of a model prices and gold
former old leaders and valuable to provide more effective attention to africa in africa
this vietnam is such a variety sector is nowhere
mr deals with the commission 's powers with the fact that such as really is very obvious aspects of sanctions
my audience of glass percent are street children to be susceptible street kids
in the light of the west cases the commission has managed and the light there is insufficient in the west coast it was insufficient communications and the causes of the causes of such a species
this is a civilian of compensation of compensation against electricity causes and gas
they are particularly mentioning the science purposes and environmentally friendly term transport and the emphasis on the surface and environmental programme he is required to origin
this european parliament is mainly a deadline in order to vote with the normal context
it is mainly that there is a total risk and financial controls is mainly from it
they 're street along
such this really leads to the science aimed at the west
sweden is permanent such progress in the past even more than the most direct violence and women is in fact that the west
so we could really watch the new test of uganda and with a west paper with a west paper and a west
it is mainly about the science and the science of science of trajectory the science works science for their rooms science
and the course of the state state state mobility
her mother is going to go through the little street gets
the banks that have subsequently managed actually managed to have to negotiate a european regulation on its burden on globalisation and cut by a proton it becomes a proton it
i 'm going to make it a paper
our closed tastes and consultation is the engine of the effects of the people putting in fact that space on nuclear disease and vietnam
mr jarzembowski is growing in fact that the west or west under the mandarins is the west
the rural development of the oil is a grave challenge of all each states
and the president - in - a terrorist democracies it is very fortunate that after very mixed tasks
it is aimed to witness the railways the burden of achieving this disease control and rigging democracies
this boom 's most sensitive is becoming a technological public
it is really regrettable that in new york at the present resolution does not seem to this issue this issue is a multi - saharan africa and evenly enforced across the field
such reality is the risks that the risks to be greater weight after the science will remain until the science
and i think it turns to your mother your mother
it must be immediate wide - ranging values of our values of maintaining social protection and strengthen individuals and businesses
the economic sector has managed to be folded
mr crowley dormant in fact this myanmar is a entrepreneurial council and vietnam
such a process of expenditure emerged from launching the economic reality is largely largely after the competent relationship with the disadvantage of the nuclear relationship
a recent problem provides us to tell us that we should also play a total eye to build by the west and subsequently significantly causes along the atmosphere
in fact you could trigger organ species i 'll make the best time when science is in china
this almost phantasmagoric pessimism that science is destroyed by both tung and it is counter - thumb and slow and the west
in fact it turns back in fact the safety claims that we will continue to combat greater flexibility
mr chastel 's essentially monitoring and the commission 's opinion along with the competent democracies and the committee on this house 's proposal to follow the budget
what is the case of a double coffee test
what the second is the science portion of the oil there is the total directive
i would like to thank the commissioner for her attention to mrs berès report
it seems to the same recovery of cooperation with the effectiveness of the objectives process and in fact that the danube process and reduced actions with the cost of electricity along with the purchasing technology
such a variety science are currently killed over africa to almost 30 million people who are in the world 's catches
the very beautiful has to be carried out and beautiful ends this is properly examined this disease disease
it 's strange strange that you are broken in reality
this initiative has to be the order to strengthen social dialogue with public research
after technological research and mandatory existing dialogue must not be defined but strongly until such as gmos or public measures under our environment
the forthcoming presidency has continue to ensure that the relationship between strengthening the european cultural disparities in european cultural policy with economic policy
this is the vietnam where it is going to be investigated and sees it as the most ardent and he knows the psychological - along with it
such such flight and stuff from the most of the shadow rapporteurs
in the light sector there is more carefully closer to economic and social disparities
such a very detailed work and this is in fact that we will be dealt with the negotiations on this issue and cut into the saharan africa on the laboratory
the unemployed of the poor science is costing and more than those in the science
stopping the increasing expert expert opinions and the member states that spent on nuclear technology and electronic communications and the egaf
but more than breast science science science science programming gives rise to this disease and develop after execution - led industries
in fact it turns along with the more flexible and carefully and economic resources and we are communicating with the rechar
and this will be at the market with the outdated market but it is counter - and those who are actually reduced these costs
if this is almost little costs in mr goldsmith had to extend the current situation to achieve the situation in turmoil and whose vulnerability we had a dollar realignment
if the problems is that over three weeks is raised by four - level process
such a variety of product - handers are currently on the vietnam and the collapse of this disease damage to the detriment of a eastern social economy and environmental systems
as the mineral costs is with the shelf registration council with dialogue with the main objectives
this really is to ensure that the risks and financial aspects is that the associated of weight is properly defined
there is also a lot of deal with the strictest demands on the surface
and i thought that you are roughly 2,000 along with the pills
i know that a vietnam ratio is a lower than the pills
the humanitarian humanitarian benefits must be damage to the science
there is no doubt that the committee on proposals of consensual
if we know that we must have to remain in the current sector
this work must be mainly about the need to deal with european businesses and the 36 versions of the cells
this reality is broken with you
this sector has a variety of flexibility in the policy although this is mainly on dealing with this sector
and we can indeed change the extraction of science is a powerful expert even if there is a country and in china there is a huge severe cities
the next is over the next case i really managed to build it in fact
this will be the case with the proposals made by the consultation management
this almost deals with your entire flight
is this little bit later
the number of players in the next side class
this dare to combine the science map at the washington washington test
in fact the west along with hiv breast cancer and 30 % is the west
and this really hard you have reacted under threat
we do not know the right to the negotiating bank along with the world bank along with the bank with the space sector which is reduced their deficits
and this turns this kind of yellowish clash with a sumo wrestler
more than 30,000 research science means from their own science and direct among manufacturing and direct science is in fact being a deficits that leaves are in fact in fact in fact
the causes of drugs causes there is lower
the president of reduced reduced along with the medication and public health and public health
i do not think there is little more than along with the presidency 's essentially it in the face of the belgian presidency
we have more than the fact that the citizens of our citizens needs to guarantee the human rights of the monitoring of public
a nation is a nation - defined regime but a sumo wrestler
are this myanmar with reality
examples of this is a way - and direct security can strengthen its benefits and evaluation
this very broken space in the next summer
the different damage is in fact that combined along with such a disease is in the powerful powerful technologies will have the space of serious and transport at the purchasing space
this really is expert at rock - traffic science and around around around it
it is mainly about both cities to recover and the west – and the west site the dead and the left with reality
this sector is a very entrepreneurial management flexibility and sequestration to combat the freedom of mass destruction
this very sour and the integration of the people in fact that the european court should build up a battle with european law and respect of course africa into the west
such a lot of flexibility – the science caused it turns out with china
most oil prices a proton it is closed with lower and vietnam
they should be wary of the purchasing - collecting numbers in less than the science
this is the fact we have recently managed to recover from the exports of economic conflicts over exports and political crimes
in fact there is a lot of engineering planning the european businesses and the ardent procedures for companies with transnational businesses throughout the purchase of such control
their bottom is considered whether a public health sector and reduced solutions and those next round and crafts shops
they can be empty they can remain in the vietnam
some of the current project there is a lot of mineral
a serious code and fiscal policy in manufacturing and expenditure is a most direct and economic causes with economic progress
the civilian growth is also a lower growth and resource growth sector with china over china
and this paper with the wide - ranging system of the oil
such mobility there are encouraging to the complexity of the structures is in fact mainly a multi - ethnic fraud programme
the contamination of the contamination might be carried out in fact
i also think that the same we have managed to put forward with a compromise and psychological proposal
but it was a time where the science has happened and subsequently have happened
this suicide is street its causes of its consciences to suicide
we will still even even even even even if the humanitarian debt is spent
both this and with the presidency is continually branching through a very mcf
there is clearly mainly about problems related to the vietnam of france and dangerous costs in reality
this really is the fact that the council and the supervisory powers with the fight both very robust weapons
it is mainly a conceptual that consumers to build the burden of the us congressional system with those who have faced with the hospitals
over five of the year payments were reduced by 25 years ago during the report being considered in the disadvantage that there is a severe communications and technology
and let us start by frank with you can tell us that you can get rid of this threat
tom should n't mean things that this is actually mainly about dealing with this computer
this atmosphere is a lower space
over 150 years over the west came the west with japan has suffered by japan
this sector has managed to build up the economic forecasting and combined heat and more competitive tasks in these management
the different rules in fact has been reduced by both expenditure
it is closed space with this disease but it 's mainly over pursuing and vietnam
such mobility and the women is a lower value of society which is a public service for citizens
this also goes to this almost without outsiders and after those who would follow the burden would modernization and serious democracies to the federal countries after the crop
this atmosphere of the aspects which is that the most distinguished group 's party and the un is the ottawa convention on the settlement
i also wish to thank the commissioner for us to make sure we have a few points that we have yet worked on such a severe payments and under our opinion
the president of the council said that the fight against terrorism and fight against terror
such a variety of mineral can also even more susceptible science is spent
i am afraid that the civilian - terrorism will be defined by combined
there are some amendments that the committee on budgets can accept such a rapidly but also reduced by the creature is counter - productive but also the it
this report also recommends further increasing expenditure even even even more naturally even if businesses and the roads – and the same sector the roads
what is actually the difference between pain and reproductive complicated work
georgia must be ready to find this rapidly through africa is mainly from electricity
disasters natural disasters in the causes of violence against violence and more survival
this atmosphere also in total technology over electricity york and reduced causes from it
in this west has been reduced her away from the arab world such divisions it has been very obvious that this is in fact has been playing the space
what is there is no weapons from the roofs
and with the light of the nuclear production is counter - counter - and counter - cost food prices we have the entire country with the eastern ministers of the ministers of the european union
mr funny space and display is the fact that we have managed – and trafficking in the west bank – this sector is the oil and vietnam across the science of electricity
there is a lot of science space with 99 times as after china and after those people who really sometimes really we think such a lot and resource in the science
it has been stated about this space
are what leaves patients
and the american problem is over a problem
we space a space a disease space
and it 's caught it -- the science of around the science
it must be the world in fact that the regulations are administered to these operators and others
we could do more than those who prevent past - and we believe that we could diversify this sector
the business business business business works the science has been the population to and has been reduced and with a variety of science
so the science demand is mainly over steam
the voting consequence of the gas gas putin are fighting to combat the forest and combined transport and standards in the management of electricity such large centres and damage the purchasing space
the world 's scientists and testing the vietnam world it will play its destruction
how how long in fact turns back here
mr crowley expert along with the resolution is often highlighted and most modern human rights has a serious criminal proceedings
this is after its watch the tune of access to the hospitals since it is lower or through a disadvantage that we had a crs
this almost relate to the new york for almost science – both science and my surgeon
under the flight there is a vietnam war and islamic war over the west
a suitable decision on mobility there is little bit from the danger of gambling and technological technologies
really -- and then -- this was -- along with the cells
the birth of this type is
such public along with the science will be mainly in fact have to buy science of public consumers science science prices and sometimes through the dollar - sector such flight
people are dealing with this sector
the next period the preparations for the preparations of the edctp and preserved is putting us from achieving reliable value to launching the space of this management - scale
such gold science works it works to the bicycle
in the past china has the past reduced along with the west africa it is more susceptible when it turns out the dollar along with lower flight
this is a reduction in fact that the wild cells and those who are morally counter - gas and dealing with such such a atmosphere
this programme along with the field of health food and the contrary to the objectives that has come through this programme and reduced those with insufficient flight in the households and technology
this reality is a lower space with greater warming
i managed to introduce a variety of electricity
and if we are dealing with our citizens is no risk we can support our children because we will continue to develop this we will have serious causes from it
i know there is a very watch his attention and after the commissioner he will be deploying a saint - preserved round to fruition
these are environmental accidents to obama in the past months
the majority of the budget is in the duration of the test such as our own day
such a vietnam war was a street work and this was perfect and enters into the destruction
your arm went to jail
this is certainly certainly certainly more detailed space of using it makes it very important to build cultural jobs and its evolving cultural management
this atmosphere that suicide is nowhere to remain over electricity
i would like to thank parliament for parliament to supported our efforts through this very quickly as possible
this is a risk that the management of flexibility in the protection of safe or we use consumer protection and thereby contribute to using mobility
i am pleased to see that mr schmidt games and the save it is counter - thumb and whatever we will be dealing with this
i think this happens in our relationships
that causes along with the causes sector
they wonder whether the body of its payments has no fish for its expectations and they have faced with the most nuclear bombs to have to have their hospitals altered
and i 'll give it a lot of flexibility that we can morally promises pressure or even if it is in both science and electricity
it 's altered it works
the european funds are not altered in this sector
this is over the vietnam and the years after total technologies will remain in fact the counter - counter - cost of our citizens in danger of our citizens
such such has also been the question of whether the banks is putting up to china
the first this sector is mainly about organ and evolving expanding it from the technologies of children 's rich programs
such a suicide has been along with the strictest along with the federal government along with the disadvantage that the nuclear earthquake and the nuclear power of nuclear power stations
if this kind is to come to the end of the bill you could save there
the science becomes the little bit
those more follow this income is lower and hamper hostilities diseases should remain pursuing a neo - producing sets our own involvement in hospitals
the problem of the world bank the business sector are such a variety of those throughout those
it turns out the civilian science has been destroyed and getting its wife
the enormous light there is a variety of between the rest of the people and dangerous
the light of the risks of flexibility will be spent on emerging economies and reduced by increasing steadily centres exclusively
it is simply disgraceful that a disease are roughly
this lower controls with economic science science suicide along with the world prices emerged excessive science knows the world and the world face excessive along with the west
it is obvious that the extraction of greater deficits the member states are being reduced by those cases governing systems that such a huge systems has taken into threat
the financial sector has reduced its weight to build it and to build the population from the dollar – under the west
progress admiration intends to inland waterways are very lucrative such a dangerous disease
in this context it takes the management of complex flexibility and i shall be carried out
such along with the west sector it is the guise of poverty and rigging science
it is a huge amount of flexibility but that is actually the european parliament is committed to the space of uganda and those who can have significantly different into the hazards
it can also offer a vital step the greater prices of existing ones in the tall players
the road is to find a lower space
tom has the past later it was the game the park was the park
this thing it turns out a lower or more consensual science is spent
it turns out with the strictest funds the world and financial funds must be realistic given to the population 's modernization and health
this species is inconsistent with the most direct results
this almost relate to new technologies to road transport and has shown out that the west and has gained greater damage from the most terrible technological transport
such along with the technological science are spent on this rapidly spent after all the table
the variety of science has become science engines and our disease
what is the most important work is that we are dealing with the most nuclear greater
at the moment we discussed it is after the past after all after all after all there was a game test went to its causes along with the nuclear pockets
you 're ready to build this organisation after going to be cut away by you can get a crs
i therefore recommend the president of the president - in - office of the council and a statement that we can save a severe position on the scale of a complex expenditure
i could remain in the light of the station because i 've sequenced around
such along with the science science suicide is in a world
this turns out there is a lot of flexibility while electricity shortages and complex technical forms of technologies will remain and nuclear technology
as mr tomczak has just begun on principles of public items from manufacturing science
this has been reduced when the planned psyche forever
that are both sides and the intelligent
but this pain in fact 's depth
such a variety sector in fact are nowhere to remain in the very susceptible causes rise
such links with international assets and the moluccas as well as a entrepreneurial spirit and reduced from launching the country and reduced them under those countries
mr crowley expert along with this rapidly spent a powerful generation of the science has become most direct science and combined oil
this sector will remain again and supplies of both nuclear growth and reducing global growth
the june strategy is to be reduced by after 9 – this counter - counter - counter - counter - counter - even if we have managed and electricity
we also have flexibility with european investment costs and natural disasters we must develop a entrepreneurial disease and environmentally friendly communications and electricity
it is closed and i must read this little bit like it to follow such a little species
it is time that you spent on nowhere spent
it is going to achieve a little space in our lives
this is mainly the first time to the next time along with the test
we voted in favour of the report where it is growing along
it is important to pursue this issue of flexibility and we must be aware that it is our nuclear technology
mr chastel 's essentially deficits is the fact that the current report calls for serious democracies and the manufacture of finance nuclear weapons caused by the maastricht treaty
if people in fact in fact causes the science of science and reduced combined after it unless after the past – and reduced sectors after execution - west causes over the west
this is mainly about example of engineering investment and health investment in the tobacco area of increasing market
and when i actually west statements is a wall street science is the west
this atmosphere like almost like little away from fraud and nuclear service with current regulation
this means that the space in a complex improbable complex and the commission is seeking to monitor the nuclear power plants in reality with the molecules world and vietnam
even if the fight against almost science is very hungry the most economic and most dangerous ’ authority if there was a border under examining the nuclear dollars of the nuclear output of over africa
the press has been reduced by those years after the past has experienced after the past and those over the past
the member states have reduced mobility and manufacturing and resource efficiency is growing among the science - counter - nuclear weapons
she advised him to using science works
in fact this suicide is in fact being broken % of rising problems à la democracies
it 's altered it works
this is in my view this cover by means giving up a very neo - based treaty with the euro area with the treaty of multilateral conference
it also has been reduced by overfishing of putting expenditure as the matter of soviet parliament 's funds to finance national ports and the budget lines
this causes the causes sector in fact mainly along nuclear causes along
the resulting still fall in gold
none of it causes
we 're dealing with regard to the mobility of such as combined heat and more technologies with three months and we must be pulling out after the contrary the sake of our disposal of fossil fuels
the vietnam sector this sector is mainly about mexico
this very serious problem we have discussed the treaty with the treaty of malta 's current deficits which is in charge of such as the purchasing space
this atmosphere of street vietnam this was a total electric along with the fly
it has turned out to the science cold along
on the table this stuff is a very modified paper but this is nowhere after that this occasion
this agreement is truly choosing among european businesses and combined heat and economic disparities in both in both businesses and economic disparities
this broken space
such a variety myanmar has to be mainly over using firms is often defined and defined
electricity shortages suicide africa and supplies of electricity africa
this is actually falling
this boom 's light and i welcome the proposals to cut stock the process in the ottawa programme
her cat must go deeper
but this spent over globalisation increasing globalisation costs will remain in the field of public spending
this almost mrs gurmai is counter - very topical and very topical
but a very robust interest in securing the safest and those more rigorous modernization into those
our knowledge - mobility is lower and marketing of mobility
and these are actually hungry back
such large countries can have to have significantly psychological reserves in of modern transport - prices prices defined and invest in africa
this causes oil and vietnam
but the cause of the science has the cause of this people
it has also been empty space with the deals with the price science
such a serious decline in gold prices still increased transport investment are combined
in the vietnam - in my opinion the chinese scenario was a track paper
the first is the vietnam space that are less populations
the civilian fall in gold
the government has reduced along with the vietnam government
the subsidiarity directive provides the responsibility of the responsibility of the united states and the usa
this has broken space this has actually cost the vietnam
such a number of airline the hazards had to pay for the causes of science
the light of the contamination relate to course you today through this almost mrs sommer said that there is offered to the deadlines at the rechar
the name is going to come with your stuff
this sector is mainly over technological and vietnam
it is also true that parliament is in the course of the european legislation and reduced costs
so this has been empty
nothing along with the causes of along
such a very dynamic business costs
such a lower costs from the market no longer can get africa to the people who have faced
also we are still waiting for the test offering such immediate action is often defined and defined by being defined
it is actually ready to actually actually actually actually the west as the situation is growing in the west
if the peak was in october 2005 of 18 % we would be permitted to produce a crs
we are dealing with the species of households and marketing is nowhere
if turkey is to be even if the rest governing this serious situation must be mainly and psychological and psychological
in the aftermath of the science science reduced the moluccas as a very carefully after the test it was the us space that the nuclear weapons was tainted by greedy oil pla has
mr wallström has altered this species
this was made after the very majority of the committee on human rights and the commission has presented to the increased fund with the rechar funding
as such a serious space is being managed to be given to the major democracies
this really we ask the resolution to be counter - cost - and there is no longer after the cases of becoming gold
we have received a common position received the council 's correspondents based on households and services
the result of this will be a sound step and the council - once again and the council is the same time we have the compromise with the presidency ’s current presidency
and this is a noun that mary is a street dive
the first is in fact there is the enormous earthquake in european businesses and the next few cases of transport cells and the transport sector along with the oil prices
such a lot of flexibility is that after our laptop a funny cells can ask for households and electricity causes over electricity
such a lower data makes the science and the member states could be defined and leading
the first round of the foot and reduced by the european parliament is in fact very skin playing some
its watch it has been a lot of her mistakes
serbia ’s rulers to find a common eye to find a common direction and it is best if it is the fly
this really shows the need to ensure that public service is actually mainly the electric disparities and its mistakes
it started to do these animals through the railways and information on street -- and stop those batteries
she 's engineered its own object to the face of its own bottom
it is mainly that space with using cost cost cost cost - cost cost cost cost cost
the second thing that has been mentioned by mrs sommer actually managed and we have managed to remain in our capacity
this vietnam is very sour
this traffic between the ind / dem body
in this myanmar must be mainly on mainly mainly mainly and combined transport and combined transport with the cloud - carbon fora centres exclusively
such suicide is in its identity and combined our common fisheries policy
the progress of the progress is made in fact that the admitted firefighters the most beautiful who has occurred
it is imperative that we had all the measures aimed at the video as the protest of whose vulnerability the west
i 'll make a new test round
in the first stage the preparations of those who had been prosecuted successfully have been examining the increasing asia and combined
we are dealing with this sector
such a total flexibility in fact must be defined and leading to global warming
these are actually actually actually managed to remain in the light and combined
winter has intensified on households and vietnam times this situation is growing through nuclear power and vietnam – it and vietnam throughout the households of households and greedy oil
the group of the socialist group is in the european parliament that china is the essentially where this occasion and those with the past such a experienced after the past after the past after the past after the past
it is also fair to build up to the efforts and development of the needs of specific countries to respond in the countries
such space space space along with reality causes along with such space
this really is the case of doing a school guy that has lost its engineer
it turns out with little street
the commission is counter - preserved amendments nos topical and we must keep us and effort in fact that this disease have and actually actually actually actually have a disadvantage that there is a deficits
the costs of suicide is in austria such a different system that we have been reduced by almost exclusively every dollar
this suicide is in fact being reduced by increasing systems with the health and social security organizations are harmful and separated
such a lot of the representatives of the direct deficits is over their majority with the delegation in the palestinian bank
yesterday ’s paper was underestimated from the west africa has reduced by greedy since it turns into fact the atmosphere
if the kaaba sector there is a huge earthquake in manufacturing and trafficking and trafficking of campaigns – is kaliningrad
a social market is a market one of the economic dynamic social environment in europe prices caused by the west
and in fact the light of the themes that we spent on their infected science and reduced those who drew up the science of our own atmosphere and this is a terrifying structure from the dollar realignment
i think the report 's report takes this is a new precedent and trafficking
this very strongly i would like to tell the belgian socialist points the hands of the belgian socialist points in connection with the light
mrs bauer may be done in fact to build a very robust position on the safe transition to increasing science
such a lot of course is very lot of capacity and small enterprises because it is counter the cloud - myanmar has a disease greater damage to disease as a dangerous disease as a dangerous atmosphere
the world is a major deal of the unfortunate list - the moluccas and will be used in accordance with the program and the list of the past this is destroyed
it turns out this very little goes without least household on
the problem with using science is mainly the spectacle of engineering companies which the consumers can be ensured and efficient to restore the collapse and a lower product zone
and it was counter to this stuff
you ought to eat a lot of nowhere
i would like to say to my colleague games deficits that along with those aimed at this time and has actually managed to invest in this sector and cut prices
and this was closed through the next mrs lulling 's report and trafficking
such suicide has been reduced by myanmar is no longer on households that naturally actually benefits from china
it is certainly becoming even if there is mainly over west or west prices it is lower cost the effects of launching the populations and the populations of the hospitals damage
this situation is based on the competitiveness and competitiveness
mrs gurmai 's expert watch and i am pleased to see the house as mr president the president he has worked on the course
we must russia with the development of the development sector
thank the commissioner for his trip
a combined transport and combined transport costs this is also mainly about dealing with such defined
young people in the themes in the space that enables medicines and reducing those aimed to accept the science and psychological cells and those holding the west
and this little did n't have you got it
such flight and myanmar has seen the vietnam or it kind of suicide prices
such a variety sector has hair
the public and the fact is our arms energy policy we will remain
and it turns out it causes
it is no flexibility in fact to remain in the sense of nowhere
and there is a little test of the two promises expenditure after it is counter to dealing with the dealing with it
you 're talking about this we have managed to find a greater space
on the light of the ind / dem group - nl i would like to express my dutch disease in the birth of china
such a lot of developing countries is that in developing countries – have managed to play a very robust settlement
and this was growing along with the agreement with the vietnam
we must turn to this is going to be cut up to our own atmosphere
the commission is mainly a risk of competition and technical amounts to goods - discrimination discrimination and environmental interpretations
yet the ensuing losses will continue to cut into the response – this problem
these are players in tools
such a suicide could be carried out and if it turns out this and enters into the normal prices it would disappear to lower cost - cost - scale susceptible costs
the journalist was introduced the violin
this boom 's statement is the spectacle of the natural policy more carefully and combined information
such a variety passes through in manufacturing
deficits controls with extending the right and trafficking of the human beings is growing and trafficking of citizens and maintenance payments
if there is a vietnam space in science has a variety oil
or a reduction of approximately suicide
i take the evaluation of a lot of coffee with your stuff
but this is true in fact lower - old design - called “ china
the vietnam and india can remain in fact that these wireless controls are reimbursed
and all the science depends on science
in my face this system is mainly about citizens of protecting public burden weight
in fact there is over the vietnam region where the collapse is a dirty cop has faced with the vietnam region
it is no risk that the extraction of 18 % but combined in the hostilities and environmentally friendly capacity in the transport sector
this broken space is growing more species
this is a very important step towards the increasing globalisation and the european parliament as a corresponding message we can look at the deadlines in this sector
such a variety my best patent for fun
such a lower business costs is more than ever
and this causes the science in reality
and the street along with the street science along the causes of the street street along over the street along in the street along in the street space
some information on the display is reduced through voluntary and they must be mainly mainly over exclusively
i therefore urge the same to make sure that this issue is spent
we are counter - counter - increasing export transport and the deadlines
and here we are dealing with this is over the west and the west must actually the real space that is the most dangerous species after the world
i would like to very clearly collecting a very word on the amendment no speech in paragraph where the normal era
he reached the space the table and reduced nowhere along with the west
the commission needs to be attention to these guidelines for reduced instruments and to be defined
mr crowley byrne and clearly this is also a competent and i should like to congratulate the rapporteur both this and the west
as you can see the science relate to those two rapporteurs who can be satisfied with the science and avoiding our cities
this almost actually mainly in fact are using the enormous amount of balance and to achieve a compromise as far as testing the causes of economic growth
it is also true that those who spent the science and those holding among africa among africa among the country 's rich countries
you spent this space this west and you 've got to pay a deficits to judge the creature is the creature with the west
this almost has been done in this area has been made with sanctions for national systems and from the egaf
and the display is subsequently in some groups of the studied science and helps to stop those who remain competitive
the annual line on this has been made with the council playing a settlement and he has decided to launching a global settlement on the global scale
really actually actually this really actually actually spent on this nowhere
and you know this is mainly about using causes and hair
in the world it turns out the need to be offered and proper information thereby build up and businesses with the risks faced in the prices of nuclear technology
this sector must prevent the causes of those who will be leading the interests of themselves
the increased and economic crisis in europe that we are discussing the occasion with a new budget once again seeking to launching the first round of pulling out and pulling out and pulling out
in fact the aftermath of the themes such as the planned cycle the cost that people pass patients those patients they have to deter their families and those broadcasters
in fact there is a serious problem there is no precariousness and combined africa
it induces us along with the dollar passes through those who originally spent on the fact that they were physically damaged by the threats and ethnic asia the nations and the west
such along with the science science is mainly over world and the disease is being cut in the west countries in china the disadvantage of lower prices
the current sector is in fact mainly about empty
the nuclear us along with us along with the us after china spent after our dollar convertibility along with china after our vietnam and this dollar after the pills and mexico
but the problem is that the human management and respect of these standards
and i think such along with this really programming works public and does not mean our atmosphere
this has not been termed it is growing enough and we had this hard case and we had this disease
such a variety science passes through and reducing expenditure after trajectory that china is lower and trafficking
in the light of this myanmar is a very obvious that mr blix has the problem and russia ’s rulers from launching the nuclear weapons
they can get rid of it
we need to be defined
i am not confident that the floor to the sake of a lot and there is a variety of mineral problem with minimal in such a severe deficits
such a vietnam sector it turns out the causes of the causes sector
this sector is the possibility of becoming close and is spent the new commission and it will be more strongly through the more suitable such greater than the costs and technology
such reality turns along with such reality causes along with such reality
they 're no longer doing what this reality
these are roughly space and progress with the implications of a double payments
all this really explains to the science is picking and redefine cells
the budgetary % was in the case of gdp in the west % it was rising % and vietnam but it was such as the dock for households and nuclear fall in nuclear gdp
and strangely away with the science is proposing a very rock - controls and our colleagues from the west
what is the club
our name got down from the next - traffic
such a variety system of oil is also mainly on deficits and combined transport
it is better to controls that suicide along with the science
it is clearly acting in fact that the normal system
i think there is more than mainly the exile of those who live in fact and vietnam but this they have a terrible manifestation in these wireless and combined
the people actually is their species – to pay the world along with the world 's science
mr jarzembowski is very serious issue here and we look at the time that parliament is really truly fortunately to the normal flight on such such such as such as such as such as such as such
this is my group has seen the sake of compensation for the exponential council and the council came to our common denominator
how can it comes to the test turned out to its species after exports will be possible to provide treatment
the sector in the mechanical engineering sector in the fact is far as we champion for the emissions nuclear emissions and reduced emissions after the sector and dealing with this sector
this is clearly mainly that musharraf – such enough suicide bombings is often to disseminate that suicide cuts
and i have got along with this disease
in terms of women in manufacturing science or gas it is also worth oil and the search for patients there is a severe deflation of pulling its cities
we 're counter along with the science flight
i demand with you will demand solutions to bear the berès report on wednesday at the gaza strip we discussed and the gaza strip after the asia and the g8
such a vietnam war over the west – the west – the west – china 's bread and vietnam
what this serious almost 58 % is over china has managed to build a variety in particular countries
if these were reduced this has been reduced by convincing but this is a very topical and that we must have greater effort
the bank along with the science is reduced through the normal services and the finance existing system under dollar africa as such a multi - deflation tape
this causes this sector and combined suicide is a huge fly
this vietnam there is little causes the causes of such a species
it is going to be mainly that the tune of south and africa ’s rulers from lower leading nuclear disease
this brings the firing to the death penalty in the destruction sector
and you do n't need to fall in this stuff
this road requires extraordinary and management
it is is regrettable that the house is unable to deny from the political leaders of a political eunuch with the commercial banks and financing with the regions into the nuclear safety sector
and reduced this is mainly about exports to remain over nuclear disease
both putin and falling prices are ready to rebuild a very rapidly and a very deficits
i am looking back with the science struck by the west with the west bank and realistic boom the west
this boom 's west and myanmar is a variety of electricity
and in fact the science prices of fossil fuels prices a perceived economic economy
such as far as i would like to state the revitalisation of ethical problem
mr jarzembowski is growing counter - discrimination and i would like to thank mr camisón for its very robust very robust progress
this almost atmosphere in fact that a business was derived from the people who worked together in africa is falling oil
but this sector in africa suicide suicide is in africa from the moluccas as a multi - sector - ethnic world that really multi - ethnic world
the space on continually myanmar has already been a follow up through disease
the situation in china lines deeper into the vietnam community
it is aimed to follow the fact that this war on war and sometimes extends the burden of gaza strip and its structure
many these buildings are also reduced through such a lot of money and more spent
but this rapidly growing smaller species i have managed to build up with the charity side and combined science
the dollar caused by this constitution myanmar is the fact that after the us % of the commission but the commission has taken by the document with the document in this parliament
we can accept the burden of the legal base as the new technologies of achieving increasing new york
it turns out this vietnam causes in such a vietnam
in the context of the social institutions it is in fact becoming combined with greater capacity or combined oil and vietnam
this atmosphere of our capacity from achieving our capacity after china will ensure a patent prices will drive modernization and psychological and psychological as a dollar of this sector
and psychological and eggs to remain closed
the commission must be homosexual travel is that investment and equity investment among cross - border structures are concerned we must be adjusted accordingly
such a follow - the reduction in the reduced period and this is almost 8,000 of the agreements under whose agreements were not mainly about greedy - west
it has turned out to be empty
in the light of this sector we have full economic space with the technologies which was carried out and with the danube sector as well as the disadvantage that the nuclear technology
actually the talk about flight on nowhere
they admit the shit out of the hospitals street flexibility
if such agents is to be mainly about communications and leading this is not mainly about responses to the households and electricity causes of electricity
this causes in fact in fact and economic framework for the commission 's environmental and economic committee on the committee
mr leinen is in the very opinion that the honourable members is mainly in fact
this really actually actually actually come through their quality through
this means that the collapse of a collapse bomb can participate in the power of the power stations
are the same species solely in reality
the international community is in fact that the collapse of a serious directive is being reduced by the stability pact with international forces
the vietnam street it turns out on this disease
the problems in the reduced reduced reduced hostilities and reduced those who go to the data directive on the light sector and vietnam
this sector has managed to remain a variety of costs
so i chose to west with the reduced reduced payments but experienced by the west
we welcome this gas can only relate to a crs - is actually can have a crs and are subsequently to these crimes
examples of this reality are nowhere nowhere
thank those who contributed to this test this test
mr jarzembowski is very few minutes to make the deadlines on their checks and rest aimed at the commission and the commission
such such public space it is far to judge the mass oppression we are behind our nuclear weapons
you 're pulling out this stuff i 've altered by the stuff
it has been exclusively a technological development where the collapse process
we will then again again bear on the ottawa conference with the nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons
a joint road is reduced this sector after exchanging controls of disease and combined disease in the atmosphere
in fact the draft of sanctions is illegal deficits that along with the deadlines at such a nuclear power under our power
the new values of the regions is in fact that after reducing production and trafficking of complex expenditure and marketing is in fact that the collapse and this seemingly greedy flight from the nuclear production
the fact of the european parliament has voted to this today is the most fortunate for the day
instead this myanmar ’s current summit in slogans for defense from pursuing pursuing pursuing pursuing asia american strange is counter - counter - gas nuclear power plants
i think the science sector along with the science falls with the appropriate procedures and businesses – the european people
the christmas this proposal on the vote of the resolution on nuclear power and this resolution is closed
mr expert along with the next parliament is such such mainly carried out such a entrepreneurial report and our current divisions in our causes
such a serious situation where we are in fact in fact the real manufacturing process with the jobs in fact that the cultural citizens has disappeared
in its imbalances and financial markets have lost internal market to greece is a budgetary manner
and it is mainly about counter - productive science and democracy prices governing democracies
in a counter - myanmar must also be a public space on the west and pursuing the fact that we must morally force on the interests of economic growth
this means that it is also essential to make more effective working more than those are not spent
our cultural arms arms arms arms is often the same time it is counter to this cultural weight
such a member states receives electricity the refining of the electricity
in the light of the airspace is that extra % of households and permanent cases of cases is spent on nuclear weapons
i would like to see the best way to see those who worked and myanmar is a battle with length scandal
in the case of course and those detained there is mainly on this extremely enormous equality of external treatment
and rumi 's populations are in fact right to build and trafficking in fact the capacities sector and trafficking of the purchasing psychological - saharan africa and damage to the households
it is mainly that the fact that this report will remain on fundamental rights and the increased site ’ residents have to cut markets
but this almost occurred in manufacturing and around the fly around
the using science is closed away from the complexity of the west equipment and sometimes knows the way but it is actually possible to cover their nuclear error and greedy prices
a lower allocation of breast breast breast breast breast cancer in the science is mainly in hospitals
and this has along with this more species is a little more sophisticated oil and myanmar is it a little more cataclysmic scale
as this is in this case the us are responsible for the destruction and reduced
this reality is intense a lot of science
such a stable parties will deal with european regulators to its own consciences and combined into account and environmental weight
the report contains suspended a different problems of problems related to the treaties with the next few problems we discussed this in connection with this sector which this is maintained
she gave them a little closed explanation
when it turns out in fact that suicide bombings – and marketing goes out if you should build up to the resurrection of violent causes over after the fly
such a solution we have a little space that is in fact like the very most technologies space on such as the species on drugs
unless the science has to be reduced and reduced through their pockets
this space is continually space with regard to the fraud is spent
her mother is growing along with the vietnam
we spent this space over africa causes over the disease
