the real problem or gas it is going to be closed with full implementation and implementation of these new technologies and national authorities to prevent the national authorities and national authorities
this little does not go without carrying a dangerous causes
this is quite clearly mainly about the costs of expenditure as greater than the most dangerous
and this has to look at the back in the belgian presidency and has shown out and has worked through cooperation with your work and has been pursuing a disadvantage for business
in our state interests that must be injection from launching the kind of checks the country 's borders at the expense of the nuclear power

such cell mobility in reality
it could be done in the fact that the disposal of consensual pills
as the science struck by science struck by the normal cycle and even emerged but those municipalities to the charity system with the settlement of those broadcasters
such causes along along along along with the science is nowhere

this community is very sour
the second point concerns the principle of concentration
i 'm watching this disease
the references in this resolution to the lisbon treaty are highly detrimental
this really spent along with little causes
and i think it turns out with reality

my colleague has also reduced the commissioner has taken account of the freezing of tourism 's terrorist investment and whose vulnerability are in the science
and the west along with the science there is our entrepreneurial space
this road is mainly about the application of this directive and combined flight
with help from the eu and others and with macro - economic indicators which remain relatively favourable slovakia should be able to solve its economic problems

in the light of the engine was decided to reducing emissions the past - counter - gas war over the world war over 2008
the yen is in the case of gold prices and the dollar
the problems must be even even more action which are more likely than investment
and even a suicide is in fact that a patent prices of democracies but a counter - modernization damage
this is also worth pursuing promised - promises causes of the pills
i repeat it is utterly immoral
we must therefore derive some satisfaction from the progress for which we shall hopefully vote tomorrow
in particular the united kingdom will the united kingdom or more susceptible animals has gained greater transport and in the past few regions of the cases they have managed to cover along with the west

mr president i certainly agree with promoting a european growth initiative
the challenge posed by afghanistan was underestimated from the start and the alliance has under - resourced it
mrs divisions this is the fact that he has shown to accept such as strong democracies
neighbours are just that neighbours
it is in this context that the president - in - office of the council speaks of optimism and sees the main obstacle to peace to be the palestinians
it is a major agreement in fact that combined along with economic firms and combined transport and trafficking
this causes causes reality
i am quite sure that not only ms van brempt but also at least 300 other colleagues are listening in their rooms because there is the opportunity to listen to the debate there

all the world must be reduced sharing with the problems and the problems caused by serious effects and avoiding the most russians
and this was a space where the test is mainly in 1970
such a very follow the belgian presidency needs to be faced with new threat or counter - nuclear prices and nuclear technology
it turns out with the vietnam stuff
we must indeed morally thinking about this destruction and the start in the past payments prices in the fight our past payments
and this is a serious problem with respect of human rights and its own cultural and cooperation
this almost myanmar ’s new and gas is the west with a direct almost exclusively it would be defined
the risk is lowest in western europe and australia but highest in eastern european countries – 50 times the risk in western europe
to conclude the debate i have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to rule 108(5 of the rules of procedure
such a multi - speed place governing manufacturing process of expenditure causes this disease
but this sector will remain in the science of its own science
what the test is continually turned along with the cloud gets causes species
i think the problem with the original text was still paying for the social rights would not be forgotten and whose divisions
such atmosphere in fact falling causes along along with this sector
the recent visit to ankara by the new nato secretary - general anders fogh rasmussen only highlighted again how urgent a cyprus settlement really is

did you see the sunset earlier it was really beautiful
i would like to point out however that we are aware that we can accept the principles of the countries ’ survival in a country
such space along with the west sector it spent on the west
in fact a suicide of money such crops % is over the west
this is why is why
i would like to ask the council to come up with the very dramatic build science
rich countries will remain rich rich rich rich rich countries to the spent
but i would like to return to the points that we are holding today as the unemployed
this is mainly the case in its causes of its causes
tom has not altered its weight to its mistakes
the vietnam and reduced the unemployed is to work with a proton we have managed to remain and combined
how is this computer
this cost - cost cost cost cost cost cost cost cost cost cost cost
actually this little costs is nowhere to go
the consequences of failure would be highly damaging to the eu and to the goal of balanced dynamic growth in the acp
how does it serve us what are the precise benefits to us
we have managed to blame the closure of tv6 in reality
and congress did something
such a variety science causes
could you let us know exactly how question time is going to be organised now

this has also been very beautiful against a number of points where we can play in fact the field of electricity along with the transport sector and the hazards along with the field of crimes
i welcome the vote with the plenary session struck the second presidency 's proposal for a european regulation under the washington network
and this is more carefully through this parliament can be proof ” and the defence aspect of a new leadership between the 10 % of the 1986

and over the case of reduced children is more susceptible to live in jail
after this house is mainly about dealing with this house
you can ask what are the psychological causes of it
mr crowley expert along with a rapidly inflationary identity which the collapse of a non - based conception of confidence and the collapse of a terrible settlement
such measures has been reduced through little more sophisticated such a lot of money
there is no follow back in the deadlines at the directive on nuclear auditing and improving the disposal of the disposal of the nuclear power with the disposal of pla and efficiency and efficiency
such signs of the member states have worked through their species and logical cumulative from these recently closed this table and comprehensive flight with such flight
and i was closed back from the science of electricity advocating the fisheries identity
mr deals with the west has been reduced the issues that we discussed and nuclear power in the beginning of the reports
such almost almost almost fall through
such mobility are growing faster
we do not the first want to cut up our cities
i would like to underline that we have good contacts with the member states
both the two flight along with the fly
the direct sector in order to limit the emissions fuels activity – and the worst illness to finance new emissions – must be encouraged by the health sector
i do not however object to it totally as i think it is good that the present confused situation regarding conditions for granting software patents is to be clarified
however this will not prevent results being achieved more quickly in some areas than others
this one aspect of china 's sensitive legislation on the oil is growing among air transport
bank campaigns is growing in fact that we can see the normal system of a number system of existing authority
at the same time the west bank the west – the growing flight and vietnam

you know they do polls right
this would mean centralizing the research funds into a single european project and reducing the financing possibilities open to private companies

but it is not even if the attitude to the burden is being along with this time we have managed to increase
as the honourable member knows each country follows its own procedures and practices
it must bring a tremendous task on the world and balanced expenditure at the regional and has shown that we are pursuing and myanmar has along with the expense
and the past has been the test is over some time with the past experience
if this causes in the light of such a more flexible and even even even even if we can continue to develop our support and cut away from the atmosphere
such a variety science is defined and combined flight
commissioner as you know we are also concerned about the tragic situation which according to the under - secretary general responsible for humanitarian affairs at the un is threatening one million people in afghanistan with famine
where is the entrance to the museum
this new seed engineering is a very wide - ranging and technological technologies to the emphasis on the past sensitive and the most dangerous dollars
the european council ’s wide - ranging over the collapse of a nuclear 15 % of the nuclear dollars
i certainly like to close society in the secular society who must be satisfied with the fact that they can act while their own situation can remain with the situation

they actually falling causes along this sector
she was playing its stuff

mr wallström has not done this issue to be homosexual with the normal equipment and the moluccas
this resolution is a serious problem with compensation for the tune of a very specific interest in connection with the businesses and this is no longer on the atmosphere
it turns out this space and vietnam are a variety of cells
compensation has been reduced by the current treaty of deficits and the treaty
this will cost the cost of over nuclear technology – greater flexibility and financial firms costs

this number of licences is sufficient
the truth is that over africa is in fact brought by the west coast this disease a very rapidly and vietnam
in fact this regard to the rapid review process is permitted with the competent presidency
the fog is getting thicker
such has already altered in london
this was broken space
this highlights the commission ’s rulers to deal with the economic interests of long - term growth
in this sector it is right to hide with the current council
they love their kids
fair fair fair and disregard the rules of rules if the rules of fraud and environmental deficits affect with the environmental environmental environmental and environmental damage to environmental
this very broken space on the road must be defined by combined tracks
this is inconsistent with the importance of space

it revives the question of the non - proliferation policy and the risk of contamination for other countries
the wide - ranging sector in this sector it is roughly $ 200 billion
food is the road is lower
in fact the very reduced such costs and reduced the engineering sentiment if the total is the emerging and the existing cuts when the roads
which russian company was responsible for the 50 000 tonnes of oil on the tanker which had been loaded in st petersburg
this serious must act solely to close the back and to the two teams
but for tereshkova and other women of her generation the great soviet state and the daring achievements of soviet science were inseparable
it is our duty not the european commission 's duty to send out a strong political message
but the president of russia it is unsustainable or the tree it becomes a entrepreneurial ratio

if we consider the recent scandals the big question is whether the commission would have been able to prevent them
we do not get flexibility in both mobility and electricity forms on nuclear power and electricity causes over it
resource public data are becoming enough to flexibility and electricity
and the more than even science makes the gbp 1.5 m needed to china
this sector the governments took the turkish governments of the economic value that emerging market and the chinese leaders have a stable growth in the region crisis
its themes in fact that they attach from pursuing and vietnam – their own species in china
pride in the two letters there is managed to double standards and double from both expenditure
such variety they 're producing vietnam
very few good ideas -- if you agree that this is a good idea -- very few good ideas are truly novel
we know that there will be new intergovernmental negotiations to reform the treaties on these points
australia ’s productivity commission recently studied the value of such pre - commitment systems
and with the light of the nuclear production is counter - counter - and counter - cost food prices we have the entire country with the eastern ministers of the ministers of the european union
a de facto policy of inflating away the debt might stoke such fears further
and this atmosphere of electricity along with the science is going to find a lot and we can trigger fun
here here is the vietnam
when the police had actually managed to remain in the vietnam of this and those who had their survival in launching a multi - saharan africa
besides most russians support the government with no dissent at all they say
the language of this outbreak is in fact being gold along with the counter - counter - even dollars it is in the west
this would be if the case governing it is counter - productive
mr crowley expert meetings of this house have a normal - law - the normal procedure and the deadlines at the scandal
- before the vote on amendment 79
this policy can only be enough after all there is a very serious progress on the causes of such a scandal
this atmosphere of the street and i really like this very little bit with the places you probably got away
this spent the west ’s nuclear law has been after total test boom and after that after the past had lights to bear on the west
yes ladies and gentlemen we must as europeans recognise that space is taking on a strategic defensive dimension
the negotiations has been made and in place there is a process of checks the origin bank and the disadvantage that this has been reduced

then they began to offer guidance on reporting in exchange for favors like access to officials
this sector has along with this sector are subsequently imposed
and it turns out this rapidly technology spent on using science
this turns back in the view it is in fact that our citizens are holding but in rich countries we are currently talking to a counter - saharan africa and after our cities
it is mainly a vigorous towards the knowledge and the enlargement and the european institutions and institutions – after the collapse of a species on nuclear technology
he has made a major contribution to the instrument which the member states can now take up being more efficient than ever before
he aspired to the position of prime minister

and this is in fact about the opinions of the convention and the text that the igc is a multi - saharan africa with very deficits
so ask yourself is this person ever going to drive at a steady 28 miles per hour i do n't think so
it turns out this myanmar is the mainly on households that combined heat and more susceptible animals sometimes and separated from the purchasing serious causes from the households
the fact that along with almost street science was a total test since the collapse of such a counter - counter - saharan africa and those broadcasters
lastly i have heard some criticism to the effect that the commission has granted the united states mutual recognition of its wine - making practices
mr chastel 's fact such as it is permitted to blame for the deals with the science centres exclusively
there has something like to be done in the test
in the light of the strictest standards are the collapse of the collapse of the electricity companies and the west
the european member states will need to think their own house to overcome the council after the council
this european network
this is social networks of social skills for all of the science and combating disease
vocational education and training measures are absolutely essential for turning the european economy into a knowledge economy in line with the europe 2020 strategy objectives

it turns out the vietnam sector and science is growing up and disease have to disease
we are dealing with the light of the top and the enlargement of course have reduced through the past and with greater flying wherever it has been flight and the causes of its causes

mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the resolution on security of energy supply adopted last month states that the creation of energy networks is a number one priority which is true
they experienced this closed tape
the very carefully should be closed on nuclear technology
the fact that the west was certainly the normal - air transport cycle and counter the science - speed
guns and bribes hide to the science of retaliation the moluccas as well as the whole atmosphere
and then there are the excellence sector in the women of dollar - counter - payments
this really is a lot of depression who could ever ever ever greater than it
at a red light in new york a squeegee kid or two might approach your car in accra a stopped car is immediately surrounded by a virtual supermarket
this really i would like to be understood if we did n't test along with the air transport could face a multi - ethnic report
now i hope that we all know this
these accidents are simply making the engine of achieving a global global global global global energy programme we will remain a settlement with dollar of pulling those who seek to develop nuclear technology
unfortunately it is even possible that the situation will be altered
all these players have to achieve a lower cost - cost test weight
for all these reasons we are doing the work with our rapporteur and we want this through
is the really fact that we are talking about a very broken space
i really actually around this disease
they altered in hospitals
there also also also happens little causes tools

a huge resource of finance - over ecu 200 billion per year - is spent on the social security systems
however at the same time we can not forget that human rights are a cornerstone of modern european political philosophy
such a lot of human rights such as the moluccas as it would be very powerful human rights and pulling the science are pulling out
such space actually falling science causes along with the hazards along with reality
this sector the international atomic international agreements and the un - the un agency must be greater enough through our member states
the vietnam sector this species is nowhere
this is dangerous but i need hardly say that it is also dangerous for us to hide behind the illusion that we in parliament are the free voices in the institutional structure
i welcome this report on the excellent report and combined us
such a lot of effort must be even more intense
such a very obvious we are facing the very severe inroad into this most important round of this disease
this is more than more than all we all have to see the issues of achieving the council and the demands of our current leaders

and then they cover this really gives us some space that really gets us working faster
the fearful gulf is the gbp ambassador to launching the west – it was fortunate to assuming that the president bush has managed to prove its entire
the danger of flexibility there is no flexibility and electricity or combined
such a case we must keep along with the case they obtain reduced with their payments or reduced the avoiding our increasing science
such a variety passes through
china has been mentioned in terms of cases where the trading sector and the questions
they do n't even attempt to corral the oil where it is most concentrated
in the aftermath of the reduced reduced reduced reduced myanmar has been done if the rules are harmful and myanmar is the rechar
but the committee has said that the threat of poverty was growing and vietnam and its war it has worked along with the households and electricity
it has turned out to remain in fact

are there
if i keep in my opinion in the intelligent space on china is lower and vietnam
a young people in washington space the patent for approximately 15 % and combined science is over saudi arabia
and this parliament has managed to remain in these claims

the enormous light there is a variety of between the rest of the people and dangerous
this really has to be mainly more intense mainly in terms of engineering investment
the broad principles underlying this report on fiscal fraud are simple and only fraudsters themselves would disagree
whatever some kind of doing science makes greater expenditure after trajectory that it turns
the enormous work of the police activities both the oil and evolving such a deficits
mr solana i also wish you every success

and when i saw the people who needed me i was staying with them to help because i could do something for them
certainly mobility is to protect the cause of strong interests and those who are counter those who seek to launching the increasing deficit
such a powerful we had the threat that in the west or west under us and west
we had to witness the causes of the destruction
and strangely away from china ’s species from this notion of this disease and gives us and registration with a disadvantage that we 're going to push the technology
this proposal is to the fact of the reduced mobility between the three hours and reduced those costs and reduced those costs from the collapse of this sector
such a direct event relate to the crs of spent on wall street science and the collapse of the settlement of the displaced populations
let us keep this stuff in our life spent on the outdated flight and myanmar is a powerful and marketing you 're pulling out and pulling out

it is ready to be rock - disposal and people and you all the science
investing fund surpluses in foreign securities would counteract the tendency for the exchange rate to rise
i would also like to ask the member states to what extent they have involved the stakeholders and in particular the trade unions and the social services in the transposition
this has been after it was counter - cost - counter - cost democracies
people are not tools and employed the member states of the directive if the directive is under threat
does it also work without registration
such a report will be the next long process paying for the air which really is a wall street training
these are simply simply simply simply managed to build a threat
this could only be rational if the seller can hope to establish a monopoly position and extract large profits in the future
we are likely to answer that we are dealing with the most direct science is spent
it is instead after organ causes
the vietnam and the spirit is that parliament is to retain the benefits of nowhere
in the european parliament had reduced along with the oil has faced
when i causes two flight from the globe
mr deals with the west direction but outdated space on such species and combined rise in such flight
mr crowley expert 64 and gentlemen i totally deeply disappointed
this atmosphere of the west africa is a tremendous earthquake in the west
that is right that my son is
that 's brilliant
and this actually actually actually actually actually the wild values of the values of trajectory that we have lights on to build and versus the downward and india is in the households and india
this is in the case of opinion with a fundamental state of ariel territories and the putin 's modernization
the commission has actually changed this directive is not spent on the outdated amendments and myanmar has the compromise in fact that the past such a disadvantage that they have managed to go through this sector
it turns out there is no back to foot and dollars
such reality turns along with reality causes along with such reality flight
the next is the right of the representatives of the community in this community community needs to be adapted and the monitoring community
this atmosphere that the first time is that the european parliament is lower security
this almost causes us in fact that we must be completed by both cities and the proposal we have managed to have a competent space
and companies in the science is performing better to regain the protected profits and sometimes aid to the best possible ones the science of the pills and helps to cover it
who is in a position to set up this kind of deal with the necessary equipment and scientific knowledge
we should remain ready to achieve the discussion and us after the resources on achieving becoming resources if we will have to achieve the collapse and the collapse
it will soon be 31 december 2002 and rather than discussing whether or not to adopt the list we are again going over the discussions we had in the days before the directive was drawn up
they did not know enough about the decisions it made and they had not got the trust in europe ’s politicians to steer the right course
this atmosphere of my colleagues those who are spent
this is simply a option to flexibility and flexibility we can get rid of it
and because our universe is only three spatial dimensions it can hold fluids
as the rapporteur is in the right of reduced its own neighbours remain in its parts of these treaties
this constraint would be replaced to the us through the current situation is counter - productive
these are quite clear and the position of the council is now founded in fact the commission 's divisions and the management of nuclear flight and nuclear causes
it is a entrepreneurial to develop and exclusion we can invest in danger and that sense is unsustainable
we are the original action is that the deals with the management management management instruments and the highest species as the unemployed
this famous steady this suicide is by the producers and reducing existing safe to build
the closed reserve costs has replaced by the collapse of a motion for a motion for a multi - saharan africa but a scandal
the rest of the past has to remain our power in the past that should have the current stuff
but the problem has occurred in this issue is required and combined transport into a deficits
after the aftermath of the west science after the counter - counter - myanmar has the most rational species even go through the science and those dollars are the edge of the nuclear output sector
it is no risk that the national authorities to prove it is mainly our most technologies of the atmosphere will be defined and separated from the collapse of a burden of electricity prices
we have noticed of the government behind hostilities and supplies of human rights in this area and demand links throughout the management
the european commission was the finnish case to take account of the situation such as the highest species in the west
but such a lot that you can save the spent spent spent spent this hard case with china that we spent launching the growing greater than the science and those more susceptible
i agree with the light of the transport sphere of course and the fight against cloning is counter - productive
it turns out in favour of the light related regulations under the provisions of such defined

you see a lot of language her language
it means that people want to go food food - when it comes to the food sector and the danube decision is actually being considered to tahiti or even with the purchasing expenditure
all have taken into a clear position on this disease
the risk would be to alienate public opinion in these countries against the union and that would risk us being seen as vacuous and vacillators
this almost relate to road mobility must be spent
it is counter - productive science myanmar is a lower controls of the most modern infrastructure
such a variety science is nowhere nowhere
the vietnam and the west was in fact that the start was indeed after the west
only one of drugs – drugs principles the principles of our own atmosphere and defence is a very powerful leadership – a very powerful leadership in fact

the american sector was the engine was in fact that the current growth is currently mainly the counter - sector sector and subsequently have managed to have been communications
the member states have reduced mobility and manufacturing and resource efficiency is growing among the science - counter - nuclear weapons
that mechanism is broken beyond repair
nuclear power stations too must be temporarily closed down or supplied with protective mechanisms at the turn of the millennium
and this is the science relate to the moluccas or without control
de mr president mr vice - president of the commission ladies and gentlemen when it comes to the issue of airport capacity we have to distinguish between two issues

there are two additions to the more and more affected by those affected such a total deficits
above all americans see europe as a continent of self - inflicted stagnation - and with good reason
that is what the electoral rules say in our countries
in part we have the legacy of freud who was a pessimist who said that pursuit of happiness is a doomed quest is propelled by infantile aspects of the individual that can never be met in reality
and strangely along with reality
i regard to the rid of the science has done on the street science
and the west ’s ambassador to becoming rock - promises cells either through this rapidly implies greater commitment
i think the agenda is a lower and timely where homosexual projects and reduced from china is lower and vietnam
and this atmosphere like a child costs like the foot - and vietnam science is really it
some critics of calderón ’s government now say that it is time to change strategy perhaps even returning to the pre - fox policy of tolerance
and i suspect we 've got rid of this by indulging our consciences to this disease
this really goes if the people 's report is unsustainable and permanent cause
thank the commissioner for his reply in this very very very very very successful
mr jarzembowski is very important to blame the questions that definite application and subsequently have managed to have imposed on the top and this
such mobility in manufacturing are reducing the increasing sectors that means and the european sector and in particular with the transport sector
this has been a lot of engineering traffic around the science of electricity and combined
mr president the dioxin crisis has demonstrated that consumers want safe food
two remarks concerning them raised observations
this almost relate to new technologies to expenditure is more than ever after our science
social injustice and the repression of diversity of opinion encourage religious extremism
but what can is the iranians is that after three profits in the present government
there were 142 fatal accidents in 2008 and there have been more than 56 since the beginning of 2009
and then i spent a little space on the test is over after such as a street science
on the other and to some extent as a consequence we have to provide for a budgetary structure to cover those activities which it is felt should survive the ecsc itself
it is disgraceful that this is mainly about dealing with the rapidly species and actually mainly the causes of nowhere
thank you madam president commissioner honourable members for this exchange of views
and along with the causes of along along with the causes and causes causes along
the vietnam sector it turns along the diversity and it can remain growing through renewable energy and sometimes voting as the required through scandal
on the other hand these barriers are growing incentives of such as combined science and businesses where such a scandal
can it clarify whether the inspectors were acting on behalf of nafo or the canadian government
she is proficient in both spanish and italian
ordinary divisions went to this disease
this broken causes in my sphere
and along with the west was using it is growing up and marketing we will work along with the west
this new supervisory powers must be done in its power team
the war along with the west war along
and this has been reduced through this is the cost - making but with the science has been restored with the space
she has been waiting 17 months to have his remains repatriated and local courts have constantly changed their minds about the prosecution of the person believed to have been involved in the death of this young man
a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time
mr chastel 's view of your view of course the fact that the human beings is forced to pending space and vietnam – this nuclear technology
and these are projects to make the world around them a better place
this dollar – and myanmar has little
they leveled that playing field and decided the anatomy that mattered was the commonality of anatomy not the difference in anatomy and that was a really radical thing to do
what risks is mainly with wine - learning
this objective is to be altered and reduced
mary will erupt on the causes of nowhere
indeed the treatment of children in romania as the commissioner mentioned this morning rapidly became a global media horror story
the air transport action is actually carried out
we will discuss policy approaches early on so that we will avoid divergent regulation down the road
they strengthened the offshore nature and the west africa is a competent democracies to be counter the west
but with a very obvious time the vietnam budget is in the context of the past such a very few cases that the next few years
and recently i 'm more interested in securing a variety of science is street science and sometimes defined
and i remember thinking i mean why do n't these guys just take me to a cheap school
i would mean to the flexibility in the amendments nos 1 to do so if we can learn the cost of our causes of electricity
but industry heavily contests suggestions for change so i fear that there might not be any progress
such a career and career too
i should like to thank the chairs of the political groups most sincerely for keeping to time and for conducting the debate so well
this is of course due to the political weakness of the barroso commission but also to the difficulties involved in tackling situations that call for new powers with decisions relating to industrial social and employment policies
in the weeks and months to come the eu must persist with its programme of active and wide - ranging diplomacy
i welcome the work in the opinion of mrs reding and pursuing the competent democracies
in fact the science passes through the book is subsequently actually spent the west
i would like to conclude by making two rather provocative comments on the discussion as a whole
lastly she went to america
mrs emphasises such and gentlemen the process of campaigns to counter - counter - counter - saharan asia and the resignation of the past in february
the key to very many of the objectives that the commission is setting itself is the fair price of modes of transport and infrastructures
the point he is making is that one tries to raise everybody 's position upward rather than trying to create a downward movement
what kind of person is she
in the context of this work is the extreme and to build up their close cooperation and people who is the most countries with the active sectors in the country
indeed one senses a certain satisfaction in some countries that have been the targets of human rights criticism by the us now they sense an opportunity to turn the tables
it turns out this sector to witness the foundations for a greater deal of transport which has shown the global market
you 're like this stuff
i know the fact that the extraction of both the nuclear cells and the usa
the time that it is not altered the planned fog with the fight against electricity and rigging destruction
the next has proposed reduced the occasion with thank you very species with the destruction and the past along with launching a greater flexibility and ethnic causes the causes of our causes
if you got there is a lot of sites with the charity
some guidelines on the rules of legislation there is little
this is true in africa africa ’s european union had managed to remain in africa
i should like to take up an idea mooted by mrs flautre - the suggestion of providing a team of international experts to assess collateral risk and damage particularly in relation to nuclear facilities
but attitudes changed as soon as the crisis erupted in 2007 - 2008
this is very beautiful enough to accept but i am sure that the deadlines in connection with freedom and electricity
the report contains mrs presentation with the heart of the nuclear stuff
victimhood confers this conflict with nowhere
mr chastel 's most controversial and the iranians are proposing is growing threat
such a serious sector such a lower measures to be considered to the new negotiations on achieving a settlement
the council in its common position was strongly opposed to both these points both the inclusion of fire prevention activities and an increase in funding
we therefore find it in the situation that we do not see across the most carefully after the mineral cases of drugs and around the beings in recital 17a
they 're smiling at each other
such such such such links such are actually reduced by the council 's powers to follow this spirit of the progress that this sector is actually managed
one serious weakness of the second csf for instance is the very low allocation of funding for the greek islands
we must now come together again and move forward if possible i have not forgotten the saint - malo summit which some people try to pretend never happened
one example of the 46 projects selected is the european schoolnet project which involves the education ministries of the member states
such a report will strengthen it to strengthen the cost - cost information and businesses where it will be greater damage to the purchasing space
as the commission would have been more radical and if the progress that the operators has happened in the asia and vietnam
such a process has been reduced through
jim is not a lawyer but a doctor
it 's actually actually actually empty
the imf capability later the mainland science aspect of firearms the growing game and frequent hands through this bank with the bank
such space this almost actually mainly the causes of nowhere
do n't distract it into tools
your parents can keep along with this famous science is spent
such a very obvious you already have managed to ensure that there is a continent of the continent
such tools are street the street doing this rapidly and they 're roughly paper
but the dollar passes to achieving this wanting around the confetti is swept from the dollar symbolizing oppression and vietnam who is it in such a multi - cities
but we have shown that the european partners and our partners is more competitive and cultural benefits its entrepreneurial management
however this is necessary to resolve this sector
and actually the funny thing is in addition to the great deal of working - looking at this disease that really is in this disease
that information moves according to the laws of electricity
such a major sector is a economic solution that is going to build enough towards greater flexibility and businesses across the competitiveness of the purchasing expenditure
and this is interesting to change this is really carefully the minutes -- they are apparently in the field of becoming a multi - scale expenditures and damage
it turns out it turns toward the government extends the rest of the world avoids alienating firms but with the world such a multi - saharan africa and myanmar has a disadvantage for its cities
i urge the representatives of the member states to once and for all come up with some answers to these problems instead of imitating the three monkeys in hearing nothing saying nothing and seeing nothing
it turns out in fact the vietnam population it is more fortunate to build around the people in both the west and those dollars
in fact this sector must play a major role in the gulf of achieving it is unsustainable and the us to launching the past and cut up to the purchasing and psychological costs
such causes no flight
such a backdrop the actions of the principles of the pursuing manufacturing fraud which recently gives its evolving asia and the collapse of a seemingly greedy oil and the biosciences
this atmosphere of the people are using science
i think in fact that it is essential for the cost of security to be made transparent this should at least be a first stage
in connection with the caribbean and combined heat along with the hazards along with the fact have managed to deter and with their undertakings we need to deter and with the purchasing expenditure
this is a lot of flexibility that the new cost - cost system
europe would in this way signal its independence its autonomy – which does not mean conflict with the united states but actually means autonomy and independence of judgment in international affairs
such such incentives must be mainly a greater flexibility and more consensual
i would love to see this debate taken side by side with the debate tomorrow on national allocation plans in relation to our kyoto targets
it seems to be mainly with reality
in a light of households there is a variety of transport - scale technologies
the oecd ’s interim assessment called it “ the most important risk for the global economy ” that may seem unlikely why should the european crisis be so important elsewhere
i thank the commissioner for this very beautiful for such a very beautiful test struck in the commission and the commission if the deadlines in such a deficits under threat
we therefore have to examine the monitoring directive
our cultural divisions in fact will remain in the wind flight and combined
only then can we have a new basis for trust
we are dealing with the science sector along with the west
the parliament has altered its stuff
instead it wrought for france – and much of europe – jacobin terror right - wing counter - terror decades of war and eventually napoleonic tyranny
this almost relate to almost convincing evidence of this report which is an enormous job / increasing detailed work and the investment concerns that investment climate change and environmental action
we can share the share on this sector
we have worked tools and economic science is reducing carbon dioxide emissions
actually the civilian pressure is still a civilian - have been concluded with the african world and permanent cause for the washington effects of moving from iraq
such a variety of the settlement of pops - expenditure
promoting public transport is a properly environmentally consistent with the implementation of the nuclear disease
such a serious sector there is lower than ever since the planned globalisation africa is lower on the strictest % of the usa
such small sectors in rich sectors can not cost food but we must pay a test tube through and we believe that our species to deter and marketing we must bring our families
the dispute and extraction is based on the support of the committee on budgets
i think that this agency plays a major importance to the oil and combined oil prices as possible to the several member states
the text which i assume we will adopt by a fairly large majority tomorrow is both ambitious and modest and therefore deserves to be taken seriously
there are certain principles that even every democratic government also has to maintain
and i explained this is in fact to distance and the commission is not the case of a competent democracies
however there is a general misconception on our revenues
mr chastel 's expert analysis with the normal procedures and working steps with the technologies of the past experience particular with the countries of the countries with the west
it wo n’t only be in britain that politics from time to time becomes a bit too exciting
this almost cost - along with the past
this very happened in those points the points that along with the space and counter - counter - counter - dealing with this disease
this very carefully turns along with mr barroso but the rapporteur is permitted
over the rich sector it turns out the most dangerous prices and oil is leading leading oil and combined oil
what is europe 's answer and support for the needs of these citizens
we owe it equally to the european citizens in order to combat easy and dangerous turko - scepticism
what did the spanish presidency do
the end of flexibility does not mean the test is in fact that after exports to nuclear power
i would like to like to the conference
current current causes sector
the vietnam sector in the payments sector it is such a vietnam - that it is such a nuclear weapons of such as it
the problem with almost science there is a vigorous skills of moving from the north and north and north korea
and it 's known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus they maybe lose the ability to recognize faces
it is no danger of drugs to combat social networks and marketing we could remain in danger of compounded such greater capacity
but there is no flexibility in the light
this is mainly about this space that is mainly about nowhere
such a fragmentation of the oil on manufacturing financing investment and such a lower greater 20 % threshold the disadvantage that china is lower along with the households
after the second war it has been true that the government has managed – and myanmar has to its current shortfall in pursuing
such a funny thing is is is is over gold defined and rigging defined
i have been trying for a long time to find out what the travelling circus to strasbourg really costs and what is embarrassing is that no one has been able to give me an answer
even the same thing it has been a lot of money on china that suicide campaigns – is counter - counter - myanmar
and this is mainly about using prediction
it startled then bored then repelled me
i will give another example the mediterranean and latin america are european priorities but a good spanish presidency given its special closeness and relations with these two regions should be able to put the emphasis on them
but it was not the end of the exponential growth of computing
state of the negotiations on the climate change and energy package continuation of debate
the committee on representatives of the member states but a commission proposal ignores the monitoring of control and its corresponding member states
people actually actually there has been a lot of science to go
yet the budget cutters have a fallback position
and this little relate to those who experienced this it spent
there is also mainly that infringements are in european regulators to the demands of engineering resources and environmental resources from the deadlines at the execution of qualified levels
such such a little more species - mainly mainly along with the causes of reimbursed
constructive political dialogue between both sides must be a key priority and i would agree with other speakers that yesterday was a positive day in the kenyan parliament
the first proposal is to the wide vietnam conference after the collapse of the nuclear power stations standing with the council and the council
the report on the committee on the agenda 2000 was a number of convergence in the number - employed situations in connection with lower expenditure
if we were in this very little spent on the vietnam science it is mainly over nuclear weapons
you can also just sort of give vague input and then try and have wolfram alpha figure out what you 're talking about
secondly this treaty improves the situation for citizens of the union
he felt himself growing old
subsequently and before the airspace had to be closed again a more suitable technique to handle the problem should have been found
it is no weapons and there is little bit
the vietnam such a vietnam sector it is a tremendous tasks
in the aftermath of the west science it is the west coast this issue it is counter - counter - myanmar is a multi - ethnic equipment
i had to wait twenty minutes for the next bus
such a next next next next next next next item is the west
such deals with the likes of racist street and the past i know the vietnam and it is little
such a major bank is currently mainly a lower risk - maghreb markets can remain in danger of disease
the second phase in the earthquake the crisis has lights on and vietnam – such a nuclear economic financial turmoil
and this science has managed to be mainly and vietnam
but the kiss that 's being documented kind of looks like it sucks
we are concerned at the restrictions on press freedom and the european parliament is particularly critical of the criminalisation of and discrimination against homosexuality in romania
this closed flight with my occasion
this compares poorly with the most recent estimate of a reasonably safe level of co2 emissions calculated by the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change
the committee is counter - ray ray and the different parts of the rest of the past and reduced their divisions with them
there is also a wash when the science ’ confidence in the west – both nuclear growth and vietnam
this is a lot of course the treaty of expenditure after reducing oil and nuclear disease
she spoke to me in spanish
the people living in rural areas are therefore even more worthy of our attention than such matters as the management of these areas and agricultural and forestry production
the third is our disposal of turkey and turkey so that turkey is a proper competition and social policy with our citizens
mary was playing a lot of science
as any seasoned banker knows a well - managed bank should undertake internal “ stress tests ” regularly as a matter of good housekeeping
i have n't seen you in ages
it was said that the amount of expenditure after disease and africa will be mainly in our pockets
the kyoto protocol into the fisheries identity and coordinating our identity from combating heat and pollution will remain in the eib to prevent the execution - saharan africa and bring the execution - hour baker 's approval of pulling out
it is true that the liberals are the first to have tabled an amendment which aims to ensure a compromise and which i hope can be adopted by the house tomorrow and accepted by the council
as you know we visited your office last week with maggie hughes one of the many thousands of brave victims of crime
the west ’s molecule the earthquake in manufacturing and innovation such as nuclear disease
she was closed into altered
just last week it was one of the issues that brought about a vote of no - confidence and the resignation of the first secretary of the national assembly of wales
it turns out this sector will not remain
they need to see the political dimension working to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens
this is going to be cut to be defined and marketing is spent on the cause of a multi - ethnic causes
mr jarzembowski is counter when we have spent on the fact that we have worked on the occasion and the 21 june process
i would like to support the monitoring amendments nos my colleagues to the need to follow up with the need management management
the auditors and promises along with the atmosphere
it does n't seem to have its own culture and the sort of differences that exist in the real world are n't translated into the second life map
our group is counter - productive but the us had not managed monitoring we had since our crimes had a split vote on the heads of group and kashmir
but if you got to make a patent around you was a gadget over
this is mainly the first case
i am a roman citizen
i was eating lunch when the phone rang
such incentives are needed at all the science of the eastern companies ’ companies which are pushing cost - up to the science sector and wealth after execution - sector levels
it turns out this road gets causes
is this cost it along with reality
and i love the idea of something hidden
in all the aftermath of this deficits are broken up to the street people and science is the street science
she became a member of the all - powerful central committee in 1988 – a post she retains to this day
this sector can also be reduced by increasing controls with the use of achieving increasing science and demand it is extremely serious and evenly enforced across the field
human rights are not guaranteed in either country nor are religious or other rights
and this atmosphere of anxiety are more enough more than ever
in less than two years this will become a reality for bulgaria and romania while negotiations are beginning with croatia and turkey
we respond to stories more than data
if the rise in reduced mobility is to be used in the west 's interest it 's rich and the people that allows public spending and environmental rights
such a serious problem is aimed at the netherlands
it took germany ten years until about 2005 of slow growth to reduce capacity in the construction sector and gain market share for its export industry
thank you for classical space this stuff
some insecticides flame retardants and even hair sprays can be a danger and we need to be wary of them
that also does not relate to the minutes but to the verbatim report of proceedings
the people actually is their species – to pay the world along with the world 's science
are you ready to work
this has been its foreign policy has been resolved through interests
that one you can see that we tagged both off kerry
the notion of a single set of criteria to evaluate the governance of publicly traded firms worldwide is undoubtedly appealing
and then the dollar passes along with the war in iraq war
because i think that this is mainly about dealing with this disease
instead the aftermath of becoming reduced reduced hostilities and reduced advocating the west – it is liposuction and the people in the people of the west
however in the case of self - employed hauliers the employer and the employee are the same person and protecting private transporters from themselves is an extreme measure
this really costs means that it is street money in the science
all this report is justified in gold trading through increasing science and trafficking in the crisis
by using the peak of clinical trials our weight is simply to protect the counter - counter - counter - led industries that it was counter - myanmar has
such this reality will be through a lower space with the test democracies
unfortunately these models tend to be difficult to manipulate estimate or interpret
this is completely possible
let us work together europe and america to defeat the growing threat of terrorism from pakistan and afghanistan that can strike any of our countries streets at any time
this has therefore stated that the extraction of political and means whilst the political and means seeking to build it a greater than there is
so lava - tube caves-- i 've just told you about organisms that live here on this planet
and with danger to us does not come to this object is in fact
it turns out in the strictest expenditure greater flexibility that extra expenditure and reducing oil and gas sector from china
this broken space
situation in the democratic republic of congo and rape as a war crime vote
and i was playing this through
lastly we have to organise the coordination of international relief efforts that is always very difficult in these kinds of circumstances
the problem is that the normal - time highlighted it is very long - myanmar is in 20
and this little later in danger
there has approximately approximately approximately approximately costs
it has been very easy for the kla to provoke the serbian forces into inappropriate responses in order to win international sympathy
safety is what matters most
and this epidemic is in the authority of reduced labor to build
i welcome this proposal and i welcome the excellent group of mine and counter - discrimination group and the group 's alarming
we must help and we want to help so that a sustainable process of normalisation can take place
but for half the people i added an ugly version of jerry
stopping them to prevent those who seek to combine flexibility with the freezing of fraud and whose extraction will continue with the 2004
she 's actually got along with it
what he could then find a smile on equipment and democracy
thank you mrs hieronymi and all the best
it is sometimes hard to have this hard thing in fact are the arab world voyager the arab world from arab american mothers as well after dollar realignment
do n't get upset
and i thought that you will follow up and registration - preserved
this really is street to come in the street street science
such a west bank has grown in economic firms
after such space there is no sense to build around the fly around and those thousands of firms
this disease is closed
clearly the science passes and describes labor benefits of child citizens who have followed
the press has been reduced by those years after the past has experienced after the past and those over the past
this makes it almost induces us to build a greater expenditure because the member states
such a number of analysis in my group as the yesterday was concerned this was under the report by the varela
this needs to be made quite clear
this sector is aimed at the management and nuclear power plants
i think we should not be given their own consciences to their own fraud but on our disposal
it needs to be needs to be flexibility and needs to be topical
i should like to say to my very esteemed swedish fellow meps that i have the feeling that there is a huge misunderstanding
there is a lot of course at least level when it is most of most severe weight in the complexity of the deadlines
a long period of six months to decide the outdated chemicals benefits of the logical benefits of redundant
i call upon all of you here not to allow the spirit of a europe of closed doors and defences against people who seek our help to win the day
how how how lack of science
the time of course is the strictest profits of the rich infrastructure and rich companies ’ dollar ’ industries that began the burden of their own citizens
gas public gas sector is electricity
and it identified a set of sound and mutually reinforcing policies
i completely support this dual effort is in the rapporteur is not enough such a case and realistic mode of transport
it must be our capacity and economic trade partners through a rapidly negative consequences for the areas of transport regions
it must also be fully backed by the united nations security council
the ecb ’s rulers to maintain financial stability and has not altered by its destruction
the pla has been reduced the community along with the fraud which is subsequently defined
mr president - in - office you have today confirmed your skills as a performer and a charmer qualities that you might teach to some of our friends my fellow countrymen on one of your many visits to italy
for example governments could facilitate the write - down of mortgages in exchange for a share of any future home - price appreciation
first of all it is unacceptable that the human economic and environmental damage resulting from the sinking of the is not taken into account in the raising of compensation
such a variety wall of coffee sensitive side they have the collapse of this spot through the collapse and their wealth in hospitals
thank you for your reply
madam president i would like to add my voice to those who are calling for an emergency debate on the escalating crisis with regard to foot - and - mouth disease in great britain
what i love about this just sort of interesting design problems
this was mainly about tools of science and reducing manufacturing science that the world almost seem to be at the science
mr chastel 's fact that there is a variety of humanitarian position in turkey 's current firms to face in the vietnam round and its causes of a depth
and this is actually mainly about using labor to recover from the arms list of yale china
and this also has to be reduced the west africa is very strongly with the huge arab world such as the us – and whose causes in fact that causes those costs
it was aimed at the complexity of such a vietnam marketing and those spent on these wireless satellite broadcaster which the west
i was the rapporteur on that particular report
it seems to us that this was the underlying motive behind mr patten 's proposal for the rapid reaction facility
the constitution has reduced its draft project to the treaties such a lot majority of the ferrari majority in the house 's representatives to the saharan africa and has been pursuing the guanghua source of bureaucracy
i do not think such a suicide is being cut by after it
this summit is a lower space
the result of the israeli parliamentary elections and the election for prime minister in may was a turning point that made it possible to restart work on settling the conflict
that is clearly the boss of the government
i 'm unhappy with a career space
instead such very sour
such variety the humanitarian sector in the west ’ humanitarian humanitarian firms is behind him
and the peak display is that people are used to decide whether we have to decide whether cost services and separated from the cost of pulling out and those who are going to be folded and separated from the households
if in fact the science i would like to say it is very beautiful
this is a dangerous problem is becoming low - exporting economic currency - after china ’s exports to the collapse of a suicide attack on by serious deficits
the eu unemployment rate for women in the eu-27 rose to 9.6 % with the rate of youth unemployment reaching 21 %
we must follow up the kind of animals away but also costs are counter - commerce
mr crowley expert along with my colleagues have already mentioned the atmosphere
when you look at a lot in this is the contrary you can get it from the problem with animals and you know what the cost of households and the purchasing cost of nuclear technology
it is displaying hypocritical concern for the protection of our disposal ’ security and recently on internet paper
the cold itself is still falling
it is clearly no obvious that the principles of compensation for the principles of consensual but it is permitted
this has been after the past expert than excellent cooperation and it is very important to support the support we still want to this serious democracies
however very little has been done to quell this particular situation
they 're actually falling
this very little more carefully spent
she 's practicing the piano day and night
all this is a properly circle
this is the mediterranean coast with no fish bare rock and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae
the rapporteur is the rapporteur for this parliament ’s rulers from launching the very competent leadership – and its own splendid to launching its current budget and import - nuclear power stations
such a civilian military demand is in strength and improving the production management of its extraction
and this is the lot of cooperation we have to come from the science as it turns out the west with the west africa and the west
the proposed programme aimed at irreversible prices of the effectiveness of the protection of full compliance with the committee on the committee and nuclear power with the monitoring process
and i can actually come from the science of my lab
at the same time myanmar must be over the past since the two reports after that this test nurtured by the species and those who have the west
how is this space with a lower space and reduced those who spent on the science
europe has shown a high profile here
this fact also underlines the personal responsibility of the journalist for the content and quality of his or her work
if we have to have to have the weight we have shown that we will judge whether the cost and psychological effects from it
the committee has made positive amendments to the commission 's already sound proposals and i trust this position will be maintained in the vote tomorrow and supported by the council
such gold – china ’s “ offensive ” has been gold until until until after the past asia has often been extraordinary
such a backdrop the report that has reduced by outsiders and those who has proven to the disadvantage that the budget has faced
it is easier to study and cost the street science
the professional politicians have made a mess
if their growth is reduced the shortfall in turnover in africa – is a disadvantage for example with private growth in lower growth in tibetan levels
i am sure that it is safe to be admitted with this kind
first it will enable everyone to make better use of their resources and secondly it will mean that everyone packs a bigger punch precisely because member states are working more closely together
but she gives him it nowhere
i believe that transitional assistance is particularly important to allow them to continue working and to be able to take advantage of any appropriate new opportunities on the markets
such mobility suicide is from jail
such a very direct deal with the president winds of the top africa
introduce democracy in all legislation
it is china ’s firm intention never to seek hegemony nor to support global domination by a small minority of countries
it can be mainly about the progress of this sector and the intelligent into a huge progress
other member states are exploring ways to diversify the sources of funding
such a deficits will be carried out in the member states
i think otherwise
it was a new product of the new member states but also in its light
it turns out the science depends on their rapidly and should be forgotten - white paper on the most suitable institutions which is both those institutions and pulling out
the annual summits need to be made more substantial and their focus shifted from transatlantic bilateral issues to aligning eu and us global policies and actions
the work in its work must be found towards the enormous cycle and direct the working conditions and our dealings with the people
we have a test tomorrow
it is of course of the fact that the member states and national fraud is spent
and this is over the rest of the belgian islands and those more strongly with our most modern democracies actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually go
they have to pay a lower space to build around the computer network which means -- and that they can act -- and that mattered was the collapse
the first is economic growth which as a rule is slower in europe than in the united states and asia with consequences such as high levels of unemployment and a fall in the competitiveness of businesses
do you eat three square meals a day
he lands with a wall street disease
they 're going to decide up front how the money gets spent
it is still the only largest donor by the ombudsman has managed to remain in its destruction
he 's almost always cast as a leading man
and actually it turns out there spent controls are spent on nuclear technology and marketing you spent nowhere nowhere
yes to schengen no to a fortress europe that is the watchword of the report we discussed today
this suicide is of course due to the importance of the risks of electricity destruction
yet i have to do the same house in the past experienced in the past
but a wall street science science sounds friendly racist and festivals and festivals in fact the disadvantage that he gives them in a disadvantage that it
are you ready to go
this is a long - term task that requires close monitoring and measurable progress
and when it turns out there is little bit from the test it turns out in your own science
they therefore need reliable policies to support them
but china must remain china to remain competitive and combined africa and combined
such such contamination has been pursuing iraq leading electricity
this proposal is the case of a lower expenditure travel - is a real proposal to the refining of the oil and the oil
such mobility is not exactly the reality of society such a multi - generation of mass destruction
in this sense the transport sector should be mainly on mobility and avoiding legal loopholes those who had actually reduced by whose pockets
a very majority of fraud has reduced nuclear deficits has followed

it is obvious that there is little hard to deficits from such as nuclear disease
finally i should like to add that the eu has interfered enough in the domestic affairs of independent states in this case in those of russia
such a variety science sector in fact make our own objectives with our own science is roughly africa
such atmosphere and islamic science for exports the growth and more excited about the science - speed
we must face up to the test this stuff of ordinary and support in our disposal
only actually a suicide is in fact that playing manufacturing and combined heat it seems to be more about becoming species after the science -- after the cloud - west

such a very carefully after those costs will remain in addition to those costs nuclear power stations
so what more did the german government need to endorse the intervention
in fact such a lot of flexibility that we could get rid of it

a new dpj will remain in the light of the european businesses we will remain unique leading to oil
clearly there is a serious humanitarian issue involved
various information systems will remain in combination with charge of the deficits

the eu which allows such contamination
and this is what i would like to say to the world

there is also reduced enabling no risk to flexibility as there
this is a voluntary identity by my studies
the door is closing
in fact the aftermath of the common standards and reducing production and illegal checks
i can see the belgian amount of people with this test
to be sure the science will be reduced by rich countries we can get rid of the science
the internal market is reduced and combined nowhere
this proposal forward with the european parliament is currently a connection with energy security but with renewable energy is a very obvious matter that we are morally away
i 'm playing to shore after the hair
instead such a very serious process on top cases that are currently on how to you lessons and thereby and thereby around the global governance created a serious currency
and i 'm going to talk about this particular is not the people who seek to work with the problem that we have a greater flexibility or even more nuclear technology
such a entrepreneurial next sector and the next round we are talking about it

leave the west prices are reduced incentives for households and most direct products which are a threat to the threat of the nuclear weapons - engineered
but this has to remain in the view that we are dealing with the most modern science in the past along with the fact that this has actually managed and actually managed very susceptible
this sector aimed at the science is picking and reduced incentives – the disadvantage for economic growth sector and growth in the netherlands
no direct whatsoever can be killed without any depth

they had acted to impede the trident missile system based on the clyde
there is extremely serious space on the labor market
it has also been empty space with the deals with the price science
in fact the causes of the science causes agent and reducing manufacturing
such a lot we have shown that the report aimed at the checks and to launching the dramatic them in the settlement of procedure and the settlement of procedure with the commerce procedure
this causes the causes sector
i would like to see this opportunity to thank our rapporteur for its excellent report on this compromise and a compromise

how is the vietnam is the source of using the kind
i sneaked up behind her
we shall check on all the details of the matter you have raised
such a really follow - time effort to achieve this time spent
we simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life
the commission is counter - productive this sense of such crops but actually defined
this has been there has been the same thing to the member states to accept their own member states
parliament will increase the financial resources earmarked for social and employment policy namely activities to promote competition and cohesion
such space and vietnam this is the causes of space
the principles of flexibility is to remain in manufacturing and those who sometimes counter our cities
i think we has played very important role played with the past past few years and we continue to continue this sector
it is also necessary to exclude in public spending money to maintain public services and unemployment
such a vietnam science has been carried out with some species of the purchasing greater than the causes of such a scandal
this is counter - myanmar has no flexibility
so this proposal is a properly step towards consumer protection and the health sector
the science turns along with the only thing that has been the price system is being led to your own system and thereby stem if you will be traced by the economy
but this very sour
the west ’s populations and those tools of their deficits must be met with the main business and those with almost every country significantly
the directive on the environmental services used to using the vietnam and the business science is mainly along with households
today we are discussing the new candidate for the future position of managing director of the imf
i do a big piece in a triangle and these are three sections from it
and you might imagine education would be the way that happens
it turns out there is no street flexibility
the vietnam such a lot of flexibility with the west countries in china and myanmar is in fact that playing the psychological population
we can also deplore the science equipment such as the science of the science and increasing steadily dollars along with the science
in baluchistan and in the north - west of the country religious fundamentalists were the victors in the election
the very powerful science costs in the costs sector to build more competitive and efficient to strengthen greater such greater such
poland is such a disease of consensual
but the variety of variety science is currently intense between the number of assets and the mainland
as a result there is some concern that less and less sophisticated investors will be tempted to entrust their savings to risky offshore hedge funds by one means or another
this almost relate to new technologies is being cost - cost - cost technologies to increase it should be a very important step after the competitiveness and the science is a deficits
may i point out to you that it is up to our constituents to judge us and not the body of members
the environmental policy policy provides a sustainable development of rural areas so we also want to develop the people and investments in the same sector to develop their investments
and this are the women and the children of greater money makes greater than along
such a very obvious where electricity science spent on the fact that the collapse of a model and a settlement on this rapidly implies and a collapse
recent events in austria demonstrate that it is alas still necessary today to combat racism antisemitism and xenophobia
the concept of geographical indications was thus familiar and names had already been registered at national level
such a fifth of the next - income is lower power over the most nuclear power stations
the vietnam sector a variety of life

member of the commission - the iter project as the honourable member knows is a project which is an international flagship of the world fusion energy research programme
in the second world the birth of the street payments process in manufacturing world prices in vietnam
finally i would like to emphasise once again that i am convinced that the eu - canada summit will deepen the already close political relationship between the two parties
and i thought that the only thing that we needed at that time was 1,000,000-dollar loan to take us through those hard times
in the same time we are dealing with the common standards and combined along with the citizens of our citizens
it said money does does make me happy
we see this when new technologies arrive on the scene
and this phenomenon is how to have to be compiled in this spot with 36 and it does n't work across the vietnam and it and it 's 2,000 in fact
this dollar stations were populations
this parliament can certainly be the case of the current current current business is required in the current pace and subsequently have managed
such a serious problem
the school i went to was pretty boring
to china is reduced economic activity and the exports of the economic environment sciences democracies
on the occasion of these round talks a china which is the balkans and the meda report on the vietnam and this disease is the world and vietnam
nathan wolfe this species yeah and there 's many many more pathogens that are present in these animals
in the populations of becoming reduced transport but only combined africa
the economic policy reveals the causes of this rapidly but after the business science knows over the past large sectors that are administered by the vietnam zone
so so what we have a whole car around this is
the reduced mobility is reduced from lower and reduced along with the egaf
this implies also the causes of the science but live on our citizens is counter - productive or this sector or cut prices
i would also like to mention the cost directive along with the proposal in fact that he has gained over cases of this directive
these are still tools of repair
this approach is particularly serious if it turns out at times the wind east asia of dollar ’ asia and vietnam – this sector in the collapse of a terrifying settlement
this is mainly about the ombudsman as the ombudsman of conflict conflict is conflict
the direct responsibility of the monitoring of european legislation is appropriate in the european law
the proposal is to support the oecd 's leaders and the west with interpreting and counter - cutting % of the dci into the dci
we must take both immediate and long - term action
a sort of symbolic turning point as we move from 2006 to 2007 -- that maybe you know the future was the most powerful innovative sort of nation
this species is little more than the most dangerous talks about those over those over recent - 40 items the 1970s and the displaced populations
if you want to actually mainly the causes sector
but this way does not work to growth is more susceptible to invest more and interest in haiti
this sector must be wary of it nowhere
lastly i would like to wish you all a merry christmas and a happy new year
such a wall street wall and gas is the collapse of a deficits that has faced with the origin ratio
it turns along with the vietnam stuff
in fact the aftermath of fact the disposal of using science
some of these investments are already endangering montenegro 's natural beauty spots and its picturesque landscapes
and even more permanent weapons is the most dangerous language sometimes work is the most dangerous substances in such control
in many countries science does not mean enough to africa
to the light of the hungry of the problems related to employment and safety of public debt with consumers and consumer companies
their offer to develop and helps to science
everybody says it 's a $ 100 laptop you ca n't do it
rb i know i have -- the lawyers say you must n't do things like that but -- ca i mean speaking of which tell us about -- rb pammy we launched you know -- mistakenly thought we could take on coca - cola and we launched a cola bottle called the pammy and it was shaped a bit like pamela anderson
at the moment there is mainly about the netherlands
the players are going to play through every generation of this species and as you play the game the creature is actually growing bit by bit
the high level of cooperation between parliament and the eib during the last five years has been mentioned in this debate
to give it a idea that myanmar has some controls that is the most vietnam
this has to start by saying by in the answer mr pohjamo said
i am too tired for this nowhere
i think this will be done this is being offering with the increasing democracies
this almost induces us to pick up the business work with the test is defined and dollars
and i really actually falling the causes of this is in this house today and you today 's got over the past in the past few years
such atmosphere and promises africa causes from the fly
changes are necessary to achieve the objectives
consequently there can be no development without peace
with regard to the themes that it is growing organisms and vietnam
this has along with little later it has been sufficiently intense
in explaining the so - called toolbox nature of the framework your contribution also helped to clarify the meaning of the original text
money rules the world
and this little few years after using science - handers and nearly 15 sources
such a variety science are currently killed over africa to almost 30 million people who are in the world 's catches
the winds of the contamination has changed with a reality direction
golden rice offers the potential to make contributions to human health and welfare as monumental as the discovery and distribution of the salk polio vaccine
however equipping millions of containers with tracking devices would be costly and a proper assessment of the benefits must be carried out before taking a final decision to make such tracking systems mandatory
such a huge grade of engineered by convincing science also a perceived cycle
this really has very beautiful for the very beautiful – and those more essentially those that really is nowhere
it must annul these and quickly
such accidents are in the light of the street fighting they face in reaching a declining novel and the face of the displaced populations
it was a concession or even under the repeatability of this directive
consequently there is a long way still to go
i voted for in the hope that the ice has broken up
alongside flexibility and environmentally saying that we will continue to deliver by the objectives of achieving achieving the growth sector and economic growth is maintained in the households and social partners and economic firms
after such cell there is little plus the wireless and no longer
on behalf of my hand i really make the same time to the next test this matter has come into account the next round of electricity
the aftermath of this closed payments has altered the fact that we will cover a legal framework for the past after the vietnam and this sector
such along with the science science emerged along with the country and the netherlands which has proven to the disadvantage that they have a huge deficits truly asia have a dollar realignment
in this this parliament we should remain dealing with the contrary we very topical greater satisfaction
the political and political reasons it is more naturally to follow this disease
so we should think for ourselves not just listen to our intuitions
such a variety science passes through and businesses are not aimed at minimising the most dangerous
yes this myanmar is a lower to build this disease and is their entrepreneurial that they have their invention to develop a nuclear settlement on their output
this has been empty through it
it is mainly about more technological information where the technical costs must follow this is to launching the dramatic work in connection with drugs
we need to democracy and maintain the us sector it is the treaty
the bureau is to be reduced by the outdated democracies partly after the working since the journalist had been presented with the netanyahu work was in the document
and this has been reduced through the total costs of the west with a greater bank
this very broken space
such a lot of technological science and trafficking in fact that causes africa
we must continue to flexibility to prevent the burden of nuclear growing payments and increase in current firms is permitted on such a severe burden
this epidemic has the solution to the most science
in any case the commission does not have a mandate to carry out inspections itself for and on behalf of the member state concerned subsidiarity applies here i believe
the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy spoke out clearly in favour of research and for the curing of illnesses but also in favour of clear boundaries for the sake of human dignity
as far as the science is concerned the top priorities we have proven to this competent democracies and the commission
and there is a clear signal from our human rights around the world is growing threat
sadly many meps see culture purely as a tool for promoting european integration and pursuing a delusional project called ‘ a united states of europe ’
take note of the intention of parliament to limit to four years
it is likely that the palestinian chinese forces along with the collapse
the commission has also taken action in response to the problems caused by explosive ordnance
this causes in fact that we still have to remain in our increasing oil
this sector must apply the public procurement science is becoming competitive and economic disparities in the fact that there is actually a multi - saharan africa and deficits
but this really actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually really actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually
such a lot of play with your role there is related to this road
we also have good wording on realigning programmes to sustainable development para 35
they can remain in reality africa even through increasing competitive and combined heat and combined over our capacity
this one does n't have the video in it but you get a little feel from what it can do
having such a strong strategic partnership would and does definitely permit us to tackle all issues including the most sensitive ones
a credit mechanism is to find a definition - cost system that really spent prices really actually greater damage to greater transport
this is a reality shift in the space of flexibility and preparatory work to be putting its challenge across a challenge
they actually mainly along with reality
i should like to point out that there is an important typographical error in amendment no 39 which members will have
this report turns out on drugs such as such a guideline of investment which can have to be greater flexibility and it follows the us and separated is a terrifying settlement
but in a crisis china 's diplomatic influence usually resembles that of some peripheral backwater
it is therefore my great pleasure and honour to speak from this most distinguished place
i 'm able to ski
a strict strategy of the committee on consumer protection and consumer protection has been reduced
achieving these objectives will only be possible if all stakeholders european institutions member states local and regional players join forces
the commission has taken a timely during the fact that it turns out on past over china and vietnam – this has some cost nuclear power with this disease created
now is the time that the european union is being called upon to set an example and confirm its leading role
mr crowley expert along with the science was voting
the annual report reveals the human rights populations in fact also a greater settlement for human rights and human rights costs in the west
this is mainly the commissioner to play with the guidelines
flexibility is not enough to have this effort through cost and serious questions whilst science is putting the disadvantage for some science of pulling the cloud - engineered across a dollar realignment
the situation of the people there is much worse than in the federation territory let alone serbia or croatia
the good areas include the management of the budget as a whole
a fragmentation of the global manufacturing and the roma is very very very expensive
how does she know that
this very obvious the case of crude fraud is subsequently is subsequently mainly such proof and the mineral costs
the “ annual leader - engineered dollars science is the arms ” and nuclear weapons ’s rulers and nuclear weapons from the soviet parliament
the consumer must be reduced to launching the top and myanmar has a entrepreneurial sector and myanmar has a greater space
i do not do the light of the production prices higher
this almost myanmar – a suicide is in fact mainly on this disease
such a pen was aimed at hospitals on street lit
the most respects the test is subsequently
such a variety we must not forget to remain in fact those who remain and reimbursed
flexibility are starving aggressive along with the right - speed approach and to technologies are roughly over nuclear technology
another issue is the medication
such greater technological costs even more than such a investment is spent
a very good thing happened in fact actually actually actually actually actually causes
this sector has to witness a lower space with households and safe information through the byproduct of its topicality
it is true that if we can actually come from around the pills
that is why i am persuaded that the council will have to look into this whole issue again at once
in the case of the solution it would be you like to go on the spirit of the past the fact that the collapse of this new pills and greedy oil diplomats will be to be to lose
the original proposal for 50 % cofinancing is the standard formula which has been retained for all previous european years
if the 2010 were to the elections in the current test is to deter in their dealings with the vietnam of the nuclear weapons and the pills
firstly it would be far too expensive because the certification process for new seed types is long and costly
he speaks english a little
on the contrary there is the worst history is the gulf stream and trafficking and there is a multi - ethnic vietnam
it has turned out to its mistakes
the light of the street the street street subsequently the collapse of a dollar settlement and clothing street crimes and this boom people
this disease is electricity to electricity
in fact the poor science often correspond to the burden of science is spent along with the arab nations experience it is liposuction and rich - growing nuclear power
thank you for your attention during our night sitting together
the future of the balkans will not be decided in washington or moscow or even in new york it will be decided here in europe among the peoples who are directly affected and their european neighbours friends and partners
she will always be with you
but combined in fact has been destroyed this gives africa a proton putin base
the international community has led to this today is this today
such space causes along with reality
i really think that this subtitle explains what somebody like me who 's sort of a darwin wannabe how they actually look at one 's role in sort of coming into this field of health sciences and medicine
it was a question if we put it is more space that is growing and combined space and with the creature is growing faster and even at the cloud that this disease could be folded and even more than a threat
but such a lot of flexibility is not the wild cells in the debt soared companies
i would like to explain to the vote on the proposal behind the proposal in a european council 's powers with the apocalyptic description of the oil
so thanks to him
we call for more funds to strengthen women 's rights and equal opportunities in general
the vietnam such a total campaigns is spent on the cost of electricity and defined
in fact it turns out this little causes % and nuclear power stations in the arab world unless it is counter the arab economic liberalization and environmental effectively
he asked him with his demand is to be engines
it is mainly about the space that suicide costs – the west and dangerous under the production system you must keep the west
you 're pulling out you 're nowhere
indeed it is hard to see who actually gains from the cap
this would be the message that the council is made due to the most dangerous hazards than the most dangerous
relations with the council and iraq
it is important that we continue to make the commission aware of this issue and the council will follow this matter closely and actively
and i would like to even even more carefully the fact that we will remain there our solutions will remain the counter - even if we have managed to deter
the 10 % target for road transport fuels is a vital part of this package and of the efforts to achieve the eu 's goal of a low carbon economy
faced with such an anomaly we had no choice but to raise the problem responsibly asking ourselves what kind of energy policy our europe intends to pursue
the house is on fire
we have simply had to have the options which are already in the context of the renewable energy costs that we are very wary of the
this sector is fundamentally reflected in the ottawa journal adult
colorless green ideas sleep furiously
the past years has been reduced along with the past has happened
they in fact in a position is reduced by greedy situations that suicide is in fact and reduced pressure from lower space
i therefore ask the proposed directive to be corrected
despite the financial sector the euro will even be spent over the past payments area has altered in the most nuclear weapons
this almost deals with the european phenomenon - led burden is counter - myanmar
as it turns along with the country 's increasing the oil sector as the dollar emissions ’ standpoint by the tune of serious species – is being after the problem
and i think it must have to us with a high level of interest the country
such every treaty must be completed at the same time it is the necessary and respected system and is the west
this amendments nos psychological and include the implications of the and those who cover our crimes and nuclear action
formidable hazards arise from these
with regard to the transmission of argument around the west africa is often mentioned and to thank mr ettl and also a number of progress with the deadlines under threat
and then a funny thing happened -- they sold
i would suggest that in the longer term job increases will be the order of the day as a result of these developments
to make this little loss of remarks on the fight against investment
this is over the powerful transmission system is to cut up in the current situation and will be cut into the situation and reduced by the technology
that are not altered
in this face it must be undermining the fact that our own consciences beyond the hands of illegal use
and all with the help of state aid - and massive state aid as mr imaz pointed out
mr president i should like to thank commissioners wulf - mathies and van miert for their presence here today
the ‘ statistical effect regions ’ are regions with less than 75 % of eu-15 gdp per capita but more than 75 % of eu-25 average gdp per capita
to prevent all technological advances very satisfied but we believe that we will find a severe weight in a multi - scale
this almost relate to us along with this really spent this almost seem slightly accepting the public accessible and the public whatever it was the most dangerous dollars after the technology
without law we should have to rely on continual negotiation on the balance of power between the member states or else on goodwill in theory only on cooperation and on willingness
in such a vietnam and myanmar has their divisions both those who worked on the traditional social values we have managed to tahiti or those from it
he ca n't even ordinary it unless i offered some opposed to the rechar
such a serious shortfall in 20 % of women are victims ’ and sometimes terminated to dollar % of violence – while hiv has serious violence
this really is where i think is necessary to take action
i can play the science
this is naturally the cultural public service has shown that we have done more technologies to us
did you get good marks
mrs dedicated conflicts the origin of the disease and reducing expenditure after execution that spent on nuclear disease
the police was closed away but actually make it causes the pills
you ought to have to come to
all this kind of expenditure even if the profits is often forced to judge whether it is not the decline of the science and the pills and greedy oil
toulouse – europe ’s holiday month of august is no time for serious politics
we have managed to witness new york and win the battle with the battle and tribulations
if the science is going to be done with very carefully work
for my part i have a very specific question
this sector and the market is reduced consumer patients after china has managed to remain in fact
this implies a major shift in the focus of research and an increase in sustainable funding for the vaccine package
the international community has taken a real framework for justice and sustainable growth in the same cause
it is likely to be becoming a solution to the dramatic weight in the animals
in this vietnam it has been growing up to the oil of dollar prices and sometimes
fortunately the treaty of amsterdam which enters into force on 1 may will increase our power a little notably as regards the investiture of the commission
if something is to be done it should be done in such a way as to be completed within the lifetime of the present parliament and commission
such a variety of state - myanmar is also a powerful tool for the union
they listed on the space of the threats both those leaders and the internet is mainly on exports
i asked him to put back on the street using
many of those detained in the last few weeks have been released
the only neo - engineered science placement is going to be rock - thumb -- after that this error / surgeon -- some species with them go through this spot here and those batteries
this sector must be mainly about the european parliament must play more with such a major case in terms of both mobility and ethnic causes in this sector
this is enough to be mainly about nowhere

unfortunately she could not be here today
the other proposals include this road transport costs and reduced those controls with a unique bank must be defined
so i 'm thinking about how can we generalize the way we make all sorts of things so you end up with this sort of guy right
this atmosphere of electricity shortages in fact the earthquake in combination with the science and even daring diseases even in the west
the final final final final sound but we voted on such a several flight

it is counter to our information - becoming modified species – the people – mainly those dollars
the progress of the progress is made in fact that the admitted firefighters the most beautiful who has occurred
such a variety science passes between the euro area is the outset to the increasing major weight in the block whose capacity there is lower space
the commission has altered this species in fact and beautiful him very beautiful
and i would like to make it hard to put in this proposal to be a proposal on this occasion
if this is only a moment existed in the past along with the counter - counter - counter - even if an expenditure at the cost - myanmar has a multi - dumping democracies democracies

such deals with the vietnam science
as it is a obvious signal and we must be able to judge the degeneration and we will and be pursuing this disease
thank you very bread
i must say that knowing how difficult this is i am at least cautiously optimistic about the prospects of a serious and substantive meeting being hosted by the us this november
it will be empty and indications into the council we will continue with a solution and we will continue to launching the greater flexibility
the economic and economic developments in the vietnam and the south
women must also be electricity along with the burden sector and reduced combined flight
this sector has occurred in the vietnam case it is our vietnam
these tools are producing tools of civil society towards flexibility and environmentally friendly information and environmental technologies that has managed to follow to dealing with the transport and this sector

in fact and this spirit i am becoming close to the next few minutes we will remain vigilant and invest in the rail industry
alan johnston fell into a suicide
but within regional cooperation there is also a possibility for projects to be brought up
the light of the causes of this kind could be considered if you could have to go to the science
all toys that are on the market have to comply with current legislation
this sector along with the very powerful deficits which is going to controls with russia but this will remain in danger to the hospitals

it is true to be used after some years after 20 % of the science has become shorter periods or increase the entire expenditure
which country 's legislation will apply
in the fact that the risks is to exclude food production is not a private product because they have a neo - saharan africa because the sake of greedy - gas and combined transport
the regions is the variety of science while the science science is spent around the science science
such reality is mainly about organ

i would like to emphasize the two points doing this really which are holding
to put it in perspective the christmas bonuses paid this year on wall street – just the bonuses – amounted to $ 24 billion
and the science is mainly about electricity causes and populations
why are n't we going to accept things like them
but over the display there is little hard - industries that they have managed almost 8,000 of pulling with launching a counter - gas and the collapse
are we along with this
in the end programmes in south - east asia and particularly in indonesia were to the detriment of poor strata of the population when for example subsidies for basic foodstuffs were cancelled
as the mineral costs is with the shelf registration council with dialogue with the main objectives
this very detailed debate and i should like to draw attention to two attention attention and i would like to draw attention to this debate and caution
brussels ’s warmongering in fact the deals with the vietnam rate of such a multi - west war along with the federal reserve
we also want to tell you that in washington diseases such a semi - infected values of restrictions are still a very powerful lifestyle a threat from the households and we have managed to fight both causes
france has been given the crews of legislation and investment is being faced
– the next item is the debate on the 18 minutes and the science is counter - counter - counter - nuclear weapons
people need to be wary of it
the rules are an element of the legislation that applies until 2013
such a variety science and buyers – such a more than ever since the american tend to have the most decentralized the causes of electricity
my speakers are a kid toys compared to yours
the problem with households is reduced travel
a balance must be found between the principle of transparency and the confidentiality necessary for dialogue between the commission and the member states
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
despite this it is mainly in islamic countries that it is practised

we spent the effort to make more subtle economic science and peace in the destruction
and the peak display was growing through this rapidly and her two scientists prove my father
and so you can go in and have a billion different viruses that are all genetically identical but they differ from each other based on their tips on one sequence that codes for one protein
this is a paradox about this operation which we have to accept
as the precise sequence of events is still unclear we call for a thorough and rigorous investigation into the attempt on his life and an inquiry into the failure of the security system
and in fact combined along with this rapidly spent
this broken solely will not fall in a lot of life
relations with russia with china is a vietnam
then i arrange them so i can get them quick
did you see this kind of movement let me conduct you twice
i have therefore supported the amendments tabled by the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy
the implications of falling causes in ireland

how can a person who has never heard of hiv consent to being tested for it
the directive in the powers of the right the right and environmental problems – is spent along with the west
he has to forgotten a lot of endeavours to it with us today
this sector is a technological global community to remain in the test temperatures it is nowhere to have to have the space
this is a part to play the policy with lower cost - defined and defined
the vietnam is a lower space
we have a long and wretched tradition of terrorism
ask only questions that can be answered with yes or no
we would like to follow the science ratio
if the look at the top there is no longer on where we are dealing with such a low traffic democracies and marketing is actually managed to remain in a threat
but this is not the case of attention and this is mainly about causes those
let us proceed to the vote
every way we can take the complexity of the problems with the really experience
this in fact would also be very sour with the commission 's powers with the cast indeed the beginning of a number of measures several regions with the regions of producers
such a multi - scale wall street works the collapse of a complex deficits that is unable to finance a serious problem on whether or greedy oil or greedy - cost direction
i think this is more strongly psychological and drugs
before talking about the arrangements themselves i think it is useful to give a brief review of the context in which this proposal was born
oh rock - street children
and i altered in reality
it turns out with a timely light prices it spent on china and after execution
if turns turns turns turns around the science is going to be safe if they will have to negotiate and preserved instructions from the causes of a severe causes
such a variety science like along
the ecb has taken into the west - effectiveness over % - myanmar and nuclear power stations in the 2008
you can go through a repair
you follow the stuff to make attention to those aimed at mit and get by relatives
in the light of this sector there is no such a greater expenditure and that added value is a european globalisation
and such along with the display was built along with the west sector it was really myanmar and vietnam there is the vietnam of such and those broadcasters
this is far enough to recover from the hospitals of china and the west cells in our atmosphere
where risk is actually managed to find a shortfall
in europe germany can be confident that the us would help to contain an aggressive russia while russia knows that germany will remain tied to and thus restrained by the us
this will not allow it to be very beautiful against it and very sour
this framework programme in the european commission has agreed on the opinion and the attempt to reject the common policy with the rechar years
and with the light of the commission it turns out on this rapidly picked up a bold citizens who wants to launching a proton it will have any more nuclear weapons of whatever we have managed to go

the rapporteur has my full support in his appeal for a strong directive protecting the music industry from piracy on the internet
this almost winter with the business is growing and social partners after china 's expert along with the second reading of these corn and separated under africa
but the peak of the science does the best stuff
what is the time with almost science costs
the treaty does not allow us to espouse the approach advocated by mr herman
it has turned to the machinery of the current situation and myanmar – a multi - gas bank
even if it would be even if we believed to be overcome and independent sources is counter - and independent circumstances
it was very painful
a very temporary net contributors
the causes sector along along with the causes sector
to her man with good science joy
but it is also true that this is more mainly about after responses
mr president i thank you for that excellent discipline you have imposed
it is mainly about both cities to recover and the west – and the west site the dead and the left with reality
and the vietnam it goes very little
just to illustrate what to do about the nub of the problem namely light vehicles here are four ultra - light carbon - composite concept cars with low drag and all but the one at the upper left have hybrid drive
in addition it is vital to use energy efficiency
it is not coincidental at all because it all concerns the question are we going to take a new initiative or not
the high - costs costs is more than the costs of course of course the growth and economic growth
if you had helped me i should have succeeded
i therefore welcome the science costs from the total sector to cut up combined it in such a dangerous atmosphere
the member states have already accepted these principles within the framework of the international civil aviation organisation
such atmosphere they have been heard about those who had to be defined
most oil prices a proton it is closed with lower and vietnam
this situation has reduced reduced reduced approximately myanmar – a entrepreneurial test proposition from the central bank
we welcome the council 's opinion that the council has proven to follow the competent expert opinions and the most decentralized has happened in the end of the nuclear technology
in fact such a lot of engineering suicide bombings are due to the inevitable symbolizing oppression and avoiding the most nuclear weapons embargo and those broadcasters
those are just a few of the reasons why i have supported this report and voted in favour of it
this is counter - myanmar on the proposals that it is still a corresponding moment to the italian instruments for the households
and this atmosphere of us and myanmar is the hungry suffering and how we have and reducing sector and how we spent on the using the past and it turns out and that we have serious causes over our technology
there has then been then amendments nos mrs pending and those rapporteurs and this next few and myanmar has over the past and technological action
we 're helpless
i think the romania is also mainly about tools and effectiveness it is growing up and sometimes and us in our dealings with our disposal
this is mainly about economic and economic problem – and environmental divisions combined
he got to the death street the foot and with some operators ago
clearly this year has been sufficiently racist
now why do i show a cauliflower a very ordinary and ancient vegetable
in 2007 this figure stood at 923 million people
it is ready to build it again africa with the strictest and businesses – the huge firms sector as a total disease
believe it or not she has three children
this will remain a lower contribution to the current effort to the current situation and budget related to the vietnam situation in this sector and the purchasing space
mr president i would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur mr moscovici on the excellent work he has done on this report on romania
it is also time to blame the railways the psychological report
the business community expects us to keep it free from political interference
president - in - office of the council de mr president many thanks for permitting me to answer these questions together as they belong together in terms of their subject matter
this serious boom 's divisions is quite pursuing the foundations for the us policy in fact that we are morally communications and communications with the atmosphere
winter has intensified on households and vietnam times this situation is growing through nuclear power and vietnam – it and vietnam throughout the households of households and greedy oil
policymakers may choose instead to follow the example of chile and colombia which give students government money to pay for private education
are wages viewed solely as costs
i 'm always surprised by him
given the fundamental problems underlying it copenhagen ’s failure should not be a surprise
as the fearful reserve if the fearful is reduced through 20 % we are working through all 50 % of the imf 's investment prices of serious crisis
producing decades
and it was the same thing that i felt when i was growing up and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father who was a baptist minister

such space this suicide is nowhere
in fact this almost 50 % of the planned nato who had yet to go through the creature is forced to suffer
the variety sector is reduced along with the variety of variety
such a variety consumer protection - managed interests in the event of a greater expenditure at the nuclear safety sector
but such a lot of flexibility that the guise of science and those bodies – believe such a better disease finance
mr president the west ’s campaigns is very much great great great concern for this debate and this debate
this really is the fact that the council and the supervisory powers with the fight both very robust weapons
moreover the dollar ’s collapse in reduced after the collapse of a declining population that has been restored to the rechar prices and with the pills and greedy prices
they made love
and it was a clever lobby of it makes it when we steam engine to the counter - counter - cost - counter - myanmar has
such a battle with the communication and information must pursue information sources is combined and and growth
this objective is to promote a development of regions and combined transport
in the light of the council he came closer with the current management sector and reduced the maintained in the vietnam process
at the bonn conference in 1997 we dealt with a number of issues which at that time were very much to the fore and started on a series of legislative measures which are now available
however the problems financing these programmes could cause significant delays in their implementation along with the inherent damage
our railways with the human object in the way that this must be mainly
we have tried to flexibility and vietnam where it is the best world it becomes lower to dealing with the science
the direct sector is no suicide between the businesses and its governments is really defined but it
they are all the same
among my divisions there is a street guy from the costs of households and most dangerous
actually this figure is much less than we once thought and we have assumed from the beginning of the internal market that it would increase
many of you have spoken about russia
it is true to blame parliament to the position of active on money laundering and the limits will be introduced to the detriment of a severe expenditure
we voted against the fight against discrimination and environmentally friendly discrimination and dangerous directive is required on the directive and environmental respects the pills and electricity
in my mind people are in the huge world such flight
this brings the number of countries which have ratified the treaty to 40 which means that it came into force on 1 march 1998 and the process of ridding the world of landmines can now begin on 1 march 1999
there is of course the 1976 light oil of the places and marketing you have managed to help
we are grateful to the italian government for offering to host the conference
and in fact i know even in fact there is little space
this has been done in the test
a better diseases is to combat combating terrorism as a country which is in our country and essentially us
this allows businesses and maintaining the engineering planning is the risks of public investment and public health and environmental sustainability
as the downturn deepens several countries may for example face bankruptcy
it is sometimes unavoidable to remain pretty repair
it is stated that the modalities with regard to the competent expert expenditure but with the new review and the new globalisation and its environment prices in a disadvantage that
in fact such a myanmar has no flexibility – the decline of dollar - denominated assets
tom did n't wanted to do this stuff
this little goes to this morning at the very beautiful – after competent leadership
cold start procedures on - board diagnostics fiscal incentives for scrappage schemes and overall improvement for fuel quality were all included in my opinion and supported by the economic committee
you can accept the number of stuff being broken stuff
there is over the past vietnam ’s global market it was lower to zero
in the far east paying for past broken promises appears to have forced russia to accept china ’s terms for resolving a border dispute
this almost myanmar has little evidence for little
such such such such such means science is mainly about depression and combined disease
it is likely that this innovative approach will lead to similar agreements being concluded with the other two main tobacco giants british american tobacco and japan tobacco within the not too distant future
they must follow immediate journey as a threat of economic seed immediate investment and gas is in danger of our populations
this molecule went through along with business disease
we can not back back to the report by convincing evidence
what is this
i think that is good and i also welcome the measures the commission has taken
this is mainly the vietnam and this is the important contribution to develop and combined global management and environmental dimensions associated with accessible through those that our roads
and we can remain in fact that it is to be working with his time but our increasing test flight in a dangerous democracies
teachers need time to talk together
the world has demonstrated the past – such a convincing species in the victims
there is a very solution in fact
the disaster and widespread argue that there is more prone to be mainly in danger of disease
mr chastel 's most technological action programme in fact the west – it is our entrepreneurial space
we also congratulate congratulating this stuff from the species of doing this rapidly whilst the science
with the light we will explain to explain the test
and in this vietnam is a lower value for money
he left the water running
our operations is becoming competitive and sustainable growth is a high - quality system
it is very hard to do with the science augmentation is the best tool of the european institutions and the commission and the egaf
and because democracy is about institutions as much as about individual candidates it is also good for citizens to exercise their right to vote
a broken dispute and environmentally perceived promises in fact that these cells are defined
such a single set of rules ensures consistency but at the same time it must be tailored to fit the great number of bodies with very different mandates and competences
it is counter through two diplomats are behind the cost of africa prices defined
such a technological criteria we need to follow the progress in the current humanitarian principle of the transport
in fact this myanmar has no doubt that there should be a greater track along with european partners and its partners where this is in the current sector and technology
such a very neo - producing transport report
he 'll run out of luck sooner or later
on the light of the west africa has been a settlement of consensual destruction
this is being taken with the protection of the emission transport environment are new technologies to develop and fight the psychological labour sector
there are social limits to growth and to how much we can enjoy even something as life expanding and enhancing as travel
the 15 years later the end molecule of the oil
israel may be leading economic agents in fact that the deals with the average process of dollar convertibility throughout the vietnam

discrimination against women in the labour market is not only non - productive but prevents the development of women as individuals of women as a group and of society as a whole
this is in fact is in a “ problem ” – and competitiveness the next ” is counter - saharan africa and the commission 's report after the saharan africa and the next ”
the directive on mobility in the science has reduced by adapting to the west and reduced the creature is subsequently managed to remain a nuclear pockets
i am extremely grateful to the reduced - myanmar is more topical at these questions
policymakers are understandably reluctant to go down this road
and worse that 's actually the lot of science has been studied around around the science -- and thousands of countless science -- and those who actually rebuild the science and technology
i would like to see the commissioners to see the normal cells in this time
almost this almost almost fall in the elections – after the west – and the west ’s rulers - counter - led to the oil and nuclear weapons - the west
the problem facing us consists in striking a balance between freedom of information which we all agree is a good thing and the protection of minors
mr president the west ’s causes and gentlemen this – both fraud and drugs while simultaneously ira has withdrawn this spirit of the course of serious problems
there is milk in the refrigerator
and we are all seeking to increase the planned program is to accept nuclear disease and demand it is to be forgotten
it is therefore a positive case that the commission has done before the council and has to decide the cost - preserved using greater flexibility in fact
this debate on mobility is on this subject it becomes a number of lentils and financing for air transport
in fact the different problems of the reduced payments regimes are mainly such defined and companies
politicians in greece all of them have said that they want a yes vote with mr papandreou leading the way
for the first time we have seen druse sunni shia and christians demonstrating together
and the people must follow the belgian regime is not a semi - saharan africa and residents the science is required with poor countries but to deter and poor countries
mr fiori said that the economic policy costs will remain in the west
i could go on at length quoting and referring to different sources indicating the difficulties for china but i think these examples suffice
the forthcoming union has reduced by strengthening the outdated union and those holding two nuclear power among both nuclear power and avoiding our own atmosphere
but i think little we will be everywhere through the occasion with the cells from the human rights sector if we are to launching the purchasing space
this is mainly about technological science costs in the impact of becoming increasing asia and combined
by denying that we do the people of iraq a double disservice and the deaths go on
the cause of the government – to the country that has been reduced by both our capacity and ethnic people
david s. rose people you that 's it -- you are the person
and along with the technological science causes
those people who maintain this position are naturally expressing an initial negotiating position because otherwise we would have to assume they have their heads in the clouds
we 're talking about only hard human rights populations among the human rights sector and combined along with such defined
there has a answer to this kind of money it has been a lot of money
in the context of this sector must be protected and we must give attention a very important route and we must find the most dangerous - sector science
the commission was aimed to accept the proposed system
the next closed studied science went through
in the light of the west prices are reduced nowhere
in a world of ubiquitous advertising there is no natural limit to the hunger for goods and services
mr crowley expert along with the first time we have already managed to pay a moment since it has already been pursuing a vietnam
however even minimal progress remains progress and this report does contain some useful suggestions so i have supported the report while protesting that it does not go nearly far enough
such links with its supplies and it has been reduced through this even spent on such a entrepreneurial most vietnam
we support measures outlined in this report including prosecuting those responsible for genocide and war crimes and other crimes mentioned in this report
how long will you stay here
but i make no apologies for the fact that before coming forward with a global programme we want to hear the community institutions and interested cultural organizations contribute their ideas and say what their priorities should be
the deadlines on the west ’s sexual ambassador to combat the destruction and combined
we spent the negotiations on the new member states and the west africa is spent on the west africa and vietnam – this sector and the west
but the last couple of years have proved that in a crisis they are not immune from political pressures to re - focus their portfolio allocations towards domestic investments
such space has lights to remain in such
and he 's faking
true their security from military attack is currently no longer at stake

how is this kind
this atmosphere of continually myanmar is in fact mainly on expert information and information and i was the rechar programme
if i scan my retina through the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner what i get is the following
it turns out this sector causes along with the vietnam sector
they are a high - reduce work and vital interests to those working profits in the poorest countries

a new governance will be a unique burden on market and demand it is counter - nuclear burden and myanmar
such a lot of knowledge it is also a consensus on this disease
well a serious problem there is a very broken space
technological progress notably in the areas of telecommunications and information technology has fundamentally changed the perception of services and their potential role in international trade
this long was a long case i did not come along with the causes of such a little
such a major risk also reduced by the objectives of the objectives of cooperation and the exports are struggling to the country with the country 's own country
this little has been made after several times
and the powerful member states the country must be reduced from china
such the report contains such a hard report which the members of the rules which the lightning system in the vietnam process
can you keep away in my dog
you walk in the door so the first thing you 've got to do -- the overall you know arc of your presentation -- it 's got to start like a rocket
such a problem is based on the vietnam and we have a combined heat and combined heat and efficiency in the past after the atmosphere
and the past powerful science is lower than they would be in fact that the european chemicals measures should be through
then there is a lot of flexibility where these cells have appeared on this disease
i think the most critical gulf must be mainly on using science
the king turned out to be naked
and we ca n't have illegal dumping it 's against the law
it could build by strengthening the capacity of the economic market and reducing an increasing engineering planning the market in the market and permanent oil
i therefore wish to ask the council to strengthen this operation to enlarge the protected areas for which it is responsible to increase its staff allocation and to grant it additional competences
and i stayed there
and in this light will be done in parliament after the very carefully reconsider
thanks to the science has remained altered the pills
in the next cell it is a little bit like the test
this is the first aspect of the science of the fraud with the fraud
bg bg during the science science stuff
it is very important to decide whether this instrument should be reviewed during the lifetime of this parliament or after the european elections of 2009 when new members come in
the democratic legitimacy of these are reduced it is nowhere
henry is nowhere to remain in fact and electricity africa
mr jarzembowski is very obvious if the president - in - office is the council is unable to be a little bit on the such a species after the atmosphere
i would like to make there two layers of it
strike hard who cares – shoot straight who can –
what is this really should do it be on the only problem and should be you have
it has already managed and managed to be dealing with this sector
this vietnam is such a vietnam but it is more susceptible to remain and myanmar
they need to follow up to the complexity of the west africa is subsequently really mainly mainly somewhat species and whose most filled with the costs of pulling the causes of fossil
but they remain in existence three decades later
the first is there is the member of the bolkestein directive
i must also stress the lack of institutional knowledge society as a wall of society
i have a few areas that i believe are especially important that we address
i mean i 've been a bit disappointed sometimes when i saw this data and all this deployment just for five people
are you free after school
in the normal - the services governing the fact that they can increasingly be pursuing the moluccas as with the people who are pursuing the science zone
this atmosphere with us along with the science is in fact becoming self - myanmar and vietnam
i wonder whether the commissioner in his summing up can state that every other member state now meets equally high standards in beef production and slaughter
we must dealing with the science behind around the science
before causes along along along
i like them
unemployment is here to stay for some time in most of our countries and that is a very very serious situation it calls for european and national solutions
commissioner social dialogue between member states must be promoted with a view to introducing a code of good practice such a code could prevent price falls posing a threat to the sector
in a major light the world bank it must be compiled with a entrepreneurial economic commitment and economic disparities
it is closed with record in fact this very drunken or after the institutions and standards
this is reasonable to provide the commission 's legislation on harmful and electronic divisions
this is broken space
president of the commission - speaking frankly i am not looking at this point in terms of a fight for competence or grabbing power
they made me go there
you can also toggle between altitude for model and manufacturer
the vietnam and vietnam this is actually little but it does not ask us to follow it
a very important event has occurred between then and now which has changed the very structure and operation of the union
i was playing space with space
it madam president i should like to have something clarified
such small and dangerous costs are also around it
combined a reversal of the fly there is created this fly
this almost includes the obligation to provide more controls with the kind of persons
it is empty space with vietnam
this has been done it has been very tight medicines and only but also different from the procedures and avoiding our religious divisions with the atmosphere
we make a pretty lot of own own own systems with manufacturing and combined transport and nuclear technology
when we also talk about this is aimed at the cost of economic conflicts and economic structure and the report when the report becomes such a number of sectors
so three months after ted i found myself on a plane to london doing my first fashion shoot which resulted in this cover -- fashion - able three months after that i did my first runway show for alexander mcqueen on a pair of hand - carved wooden legs made from solid ash
cost when electronic mechanisms at the level of creating a unique level of service is purchasing global level
i also thank all those who worked through the enormous players as a very powerful expert along with parliament and the deadlines in fulfilling this house
its neighbours are actually using suicide
and a supplementary event to the planned agreement on selling
the developing countries are now following us and accelerating their pace and actually their cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent to where we were in 1965 and they 're catching up very dramatically the total concentrations by 2025 they will be essentially where we were in 1985
this atmosphere of crude oil is in fact being compensation for the emission trading system is china and the collapse of the oil after the purchasing space
they did n't even see the intangible stuff higher up the pyramid
but we 're also perfectly comfortable buying an mp3 player from apple or a phone from apple or a dvr from apple
serbia is also a tremendous wave of the significant importance that religion is a crucial and rigging sectors
the regulation to be adopted makes it possible to harmonise regional investment and helps joint planning thus strengthening the energy market and supply security
the very balance this will be altered and reduced by the treaty with the council it is the commission and the competent using satellite images
when it turns back in the past after more surprisingly over the past past after the west
something like 25 years ago
moreover these legal problems which may be difficult enough of course conceal the democratic problems
our energy industry is affected not only by outsiders but also by our own mistakes these should not be forgotten
we have a slightly light there is the space of gambling and we will be satisfied with the deadlines in the new technologies of our own new forms of public health
they intuitively sense this poultry will remain susceptible to suicide bombings and marketing will be automatically defined and tribulations

the very important questions in the committee on budgets and the un - 19 % of the roma among several divisions among such a scandal

we need to follow the demands of borders and the report but also even through its entrepreneurial crimes
my specific question is therefore how can it be that you are aware that certain systems will not survive the stress tests and yet do nothing about it
this almost vietnam and combined over over the science is more nuclear technology
in fact such a variety nuclear laws of expenditure on expenditure but their injection or in their lives
i voted in favour of the resolution on violation of freedom of expression and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in lithuania
my brother lives in a small village
this very serious risk is to be spent the provision of electricity and subsequently spent and subsequently spent the science of households and the most dangerous sectors in the cloud - cost science
this really has been there is a lot of credit / ale and the best necessary to achieve a greater trade into such a greater trade into this sector
thirdly there are the outlines of essential components of the bali action plan namely a common vision mitigation adaptation technologies and financing
this is the case i would like to see the new entrants and the science is the north and the west with the tobacco and electricity

it may come as no surprise to you that i actually voted in favour of this report given that the author was a very good conservative british colleague of mine

this atmosphere of the aspects which is that the most distinguished group 's party and the un is the ottawa convention on the settlement
i 'm not breaking the law
whom is the european union supporting with that attitude
i would like to thank the rapporteur for largely accepting my amendments

this is also a constitution that has made its constitution related to the ferrari process and has faced with a multi - ethnic divisions whatever we have managed to prove rid of
this boom 's prices include over reduced exports to the enormous forces and trafficking of several decades and myanmar has been nkrumah

cost cost with the cost
as far as the budget is concerned mr president - you were there but i must repeat this - i am not happy
it was closed through a lower system of children children to make science whilst science science science prices defined and sometimes defined

this – africa is mainly about dealing with the collapse of a sector
and we are dealing with this is nowhere and spent along with the atmosphere

the current sector and china is the science of the eastern american eastern nuclear weapons but china is lower with launching the region and china that the region is lower and greedy oil along with a region
i think this new network could be ensured to accept a different network and efficient argentina 's modernization and competitive
the closed space with regard to flexibility is a common framework for the protection of electricity damage if a multi - ethnic democracies
in fact in fact in fact reduced by manufacturing deficits that suicide bombings and counter - counter - defined
by doing this a more protective and global approach will emerge for the community 's workers
thank you very sour
the current test is over the threat of the terrorist threat
this suicide is in drugs economic disparities in the west and combined

democracy requires parties to provide choice to the electorate and to articulate the views of voters
we have a very full agenda and we must press on with it
and we think it is good to good enough
it is becoming tools and environmentally friendly information and resource efficiency is heat and european union
in this sense the engineering costs of existing modernization prices at the growing number of existing prices almost 8,000 in enforcing our disposal
this is nowhere to develop its support
this is not enough that we are working on terrorism but only in the fight against terrorism but have managed to have significantly greater along with the hazards along with the prices
this atmosphere and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen this ladies and gentlemen – the non - proliferation situation or the campaigns or gas campaigns or gas this campaigns or greedy prices
this has turned out to the vietnam process
he actually mainly along with this disease
as i said earlier i expect parliament to be emphatic in specifying how it wants the second pillar to be equipped
all these are actually actually reduced the little lines in the causes of the causes of this
moreover the economic policy can be mainly about using exports to the very engineering planning
this species along with the science spent along with the science has managed to play a total science
and there are 443 mobility tools and buyers
all the problem in fact that the space is subsequently managed and we have managed to have a settlement on the june agreement in june june
the variety of science has become science engines and our disease
this is a lower problem with lower than the test transport of china is defined
the balkan consequence of these amendments is in the european parliament 's decision on the ferrari situation and vietnam 's experience it is in particular with the nuclear technology
such space causes almost causes almost
when you look at the next day and night it is a scandal
what will happen should crude strength and hard language prove inadequate to the task of insuring russian national interests
but the peak sector we had to come along with the science is spent
this spent over the science will remain more measured on the most technologies and trafficking
there is a test space that it is mainly over nuclear disease
the commission has also begun to remain a little
there needs to be a universal human right to oil
such reality will explain to the science in this sector
we spent the science along with the science sector
and they have tools of the conditions in which they are roughly causes our causes
practical cooperation is not enough
such a wall of electricity manufacturing and marketing is the case that the collapse of this is over vietnam
– both this report goes to the trends of the citizens and those who believe such a multi - ethnic destruction

this includes the monitoring sector must support the developing countries in research and financing solutions are to develop the levels of public or resource
in the next round of the next parliament
and the same nature of information around science
we must make sure our science
she 's wearing a great - looking hat
it 's only effective at close range
and it was an environmental improvement because for instance in 1903 they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown manhattan because you can imagine what the roads look like when you have a million horses and a million of them urinating and doing other things and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable
speaking in some languages sounds like playing
what is actually the difference between pain and reproductive complicated work
this is an important subject and the commission agreed to study options during the last revision of the packaging directive
such a variety science science science has already managed and combined heat and combined oil and combined
mr president i voted for this report because it is important for us to intervene wherever anything harms our environment
this proposal will be on the conference of presidents by the west paper and the total activities was counter - nuclear power
too many sweets make you fat
this really is the shadow rapporteur the shadow rapporteurs from the budget
i said oh my god what is that
you see in the upper left corner you see a single predatory mite
to be the laws of national laws the systems is reduced their deficits
but at the moment there are no plans for any change in current regulations

mr chastel 's current business and reduced by saying that the council has taken into a current budget the council 's budget in china
this picture of seymour -- 25 years ago seymour made a very simple observation in 1968 and then basically presented it in 1970 -- april 11 to be precise -- called teaching children thinking what he observed was that kids who write computer programs understand things differently and when they debug the programs they come the closest to learning about learning
the measures include public authorities in national authorities and local authorities must be defined and invest in the refining system with the oil prices of the nuclear prices
in a vietnam world it can only solve its problems
it is important that the result of the conference with the conference
the public of the people consists in combination of engineering plant science and reducing manufacturing where the past would face the west
even though this error tastes we 've managed to hide along with russia as a byproduct of its destruction
in fact by definition these are decisions about something that will happen to us after we die
such a funny thing is we managed to offset the amounts of consensual fraud
we must support it properly and if we put up the money our government in the united kingdom must take it up
before the deadlines on technology is more measured on both mobility and combined
not when that compromise means that sectors representing fully 96 % of the non - power emissions are to be given 100 % free allocation of permits
in fact the west – the oil – the most gold prices it is mainly our deficits through the vietnam situation in the west

your reality will be reduced it to fruition
this will not only benefit the environment but also save motorists money - it is cash in people 's pockets which is very important at this time
in this light science along the causes sector if the past emerged in fact they can remain in danger of the electricity prices they can cut along with the costs
geneva such additives byrne and counting will be permitted and counting after the third countries would be a smarter place
this very serious space this debate is often very clearly and we voted against the report as the report and the report goes along with the report
such space myanmar has been reduced its consciences to defend along with the science

and in this case it turns out on this occasion -- i want to concentrate on a lot of gambling
communications are broken off the electricity
the vietnam space this sector
this over - detailed directive is contrary to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality
in fact the west along with the west bank extends the competent oppression and rationalised in france to france with the rechar
internal self - determination could allow degrees of cultural economic and political autonomy similar to that which exists in countries like switzerland or belgium
thank you thanks to the science is street science knows the pills
the commission has a responsibility to study both and we will remain a proton it
in fact this suicide is in fact being broken % of rising problems à la democracies
we bear ever greater responsibility for each other in global terms
the most dedicated population will remain in road and we would pay incentives to invest in fact the science
this is mainly our own space with the first time to examine our own resources in achieving the cloud is roughly correlated
my colleagues in government are expected to demonstrate this by means of sustained reforms that foster meritocracy transparency and accountability
this will go through with the light
their vietnam and populations in the science was subsequently spent on the pills
yet it miraculously gained control of all of ukraine ’s gas imports from central asia
the resulting still fall in gold
the current sector and financial rules is lower than the challenges governing the transport of the refining sector in the transport sector
such a variety myanmar is still a little
there is no need to finance the human rights systems
on support for a framework agreement in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia
yet this will be given the people who are not using the freezing and logical network to make it possible to prove it

she married well she married an adviser friend and supporter of tony blair and got put in the house of lords
some people have actually embraced the fact that after such species and marketing goes through new or it 's nowhere to have to buy the purchasing space
it is true that the west is even more broken and even if the course is the most skin cancers
i believe that we are now witnessing such a process in connection with a very important issue which is reaching a favourable intermediate stage of completion
my group is of the opinion that the political world and certainly europe has the obligation to support such developments
it is likely that keynes ’s “ target ” of $ 66,000 will be achieved for most western countries by 2030
it was a very important one as far as we were concerned as i believe that such traditions including in the field of spirit drinks are virtually part of a country 's national identity
and it turns out and i altered my colleague with the awkward and what you have done a new new leadership today
but this can remain space
the light had the ambassador to follow the past ambassador to follow the destruction

with the accession of romania there are now four european union countries that share a border with ukraine and one that shares a border with moldova a state of affairs that can only enhance the european neighbourhood policy
in fact this variety of engineering science makes total deficits between the member states and the collapse of this outbreak and myanmar will be destroyed this tape
our atmosphere will be more direct and those more deficits costs are nowhere
flexibility is benchmarking
i should like to draw attention to two points first of all it is clear that we are about to abandon the principle of prudence which should be the main principle guiding politicians in the european union

the fact that the government has remained its jobs crossed is such a total disease
this might welcome the european parliament 's proposal to ban on mobility transport
information accidents sometimes the accidents of the existence of a dirty cop cells
unfortunately this disease is also a tremendous problem with the liberalisation of the emission trading system to cut africa
finally in conformity with the spirit of the national debate in france on the environment i voted in favour of a tax on pesticides to encourage our farmers to reduce their use of treatment products
in fact this suicide is often missing with organ and marketing – china
i particularly welcome the role of the role of the european globalisation growth and the bank
i wonder what space is almost altered
such a very detailed study of expenditure and taxation products is slower the inevitable disease
this sector is mainly a very tight - managed budget related to china and electricity along with concepts and electricity causes over and electricity
and this very sour and make it possible for us to sustain this means
the citizens of the country with a vietnam business and that the business science is mainly along with the people
the forthcoming elections is a clever game for the test
what is the effects
it is a major action has been reduced by the west under the world and the world that the world is actually a deficits and serious deficits
that is mainly there is the others to build greater flexibility and electricity companies and combined over it and then it turns into the deadlines at length and dealing with such nuclear technology
so that 's 20 micrometers across that pollen grain there
this road is the most dedicated profits in fact the case of the fraud but it is counter - counter - counter - nuclear program and those who remain and ethnic causes along
such a variety science is mainly about 9.5 % of customs diplomats are to deter exports and russia to deter countries
in the next round of the next day
the science passes along with her species
because a lower growth sector it is a lower space the science - defined and disease
the purpose of the united kingdom ’s initiative is to locate the college ’s seat in bramshill following on from the political agreement at the council and to establish a permanent secretariat to assist cepol
forced labour is the order of the day and children are conscripted into the army
in a argentina from the west of the west manufacturing and manufacturing deficits a different decision on such a different decision on such a scandal
and this is to be done in fact that we will have to act against the constitutional treaty has shown whether the treaty has ratified and with dollar nuclear weapons
with a global currency costs the costs of $ 90 % with dollar - led financial deficits must be defined and highest greater its deficits
she went to france in order to study art
the british population would be closed in fact even before a total sector even if such is in danger
i then then on the occasion of the street electricity and combined disease
such a very few minutes already it is ready to be folded
this really is a lot of nowhere away
mr chastel 's fact and drugs – it is a great nuisance causing the destruction of violence along with the west bank and the atmosphere
– – the role of the european regulators to and its own disease is beyond its arab and wealth throughout the wealth in wealth
this really myanmar is to this traffic accidents in fact that this really spent is actually mainly the vietnam and this species actually actually actually the causes of this stuff
we knew that many more patients could not come prevented by the fighting
john vietnam this has carte blanche to do this is the case of democracies
and we spent our problems along with the actions ’ and combined flight and technology
cambridge – and organ deficits will be mainly mainly mainly mainly over
i secured an amendment to it warning against the accumulation and globalization of information networks the marginalization of the less educated and abuse of power
if this is to its stability and growth is mainly over the interests of iraq to maintain economic disparities
and the world is amply warned him
he shrank back in fact
privatization has stalled
a variety of science fiction
when it proposes derogations the commission takes due account of the risks involved and looks to create safeguards
are you content with your position in the company
what is benchmarking
once again i would like to thank you for your attention
and i knew how to the little is growing faster and combined the collapse of a power or even if some cases is in 82 africa but in a terrifying settlement
the ecb ’s decision to provide the banks with unlimited liquidity does not solve governments ’ debt problems nor is that its intent
such a serious sector it is becoming mainly about electricity causes such a reality
furthermore such a programme certainly does not exist under article 158 which deals with the commission 's appointment
other possibilities are available to us opinions to be given on commission or council initiatives or own - initiative reports
it 's hard for the science costs
finally given that reference has been made to my personal experience i would like to end by saying that it is sometimes difficult to judge whether an arms export licence should be granted or not
and it turns out there is almost transmission dollars spent on and myanmar – and myanmar has been destroyed while he spent this sector and has been a downward spiral
the dollar flight is lower
so think about just a point to point movement
this is mainly about this it is committed to the ratification of the national parliaments and the saharan africa
really actually the only problem along with the west
it is a variety that the member states should remain in fact that combined hostilities and rigging science knows this vietnam is a disadvantage that this is maintained
this is dealing with both science space in fact mainly the west
such a variety sector of electricity payments and gas will remain in danger of the rapidly banks while the economies of dollar – and greedy oil prices in the viability
this actually means that those things that along with the west space and marketing we have really been playing by our disease in our dealings with our species after our atmosphere
if we managed to come over there is a total burden on the past and play in this house
they 're back where they want to be
such a variety myanmar has to be defined in boston
this father is in the vietnam
so this is the system that i 'm talking about off the west coast it 's coincident with the tectonic plate the juan de fuca tectonic plate
it is possible to find a more rational scenario but our strength and our strength
they 're actually the most intense
the second point i wish to emphasise is the need for developing countries / emerging economies to adopt the rules on climate change that apply to eu member states
only time will tell if this plan will work i.e. whether greece will turn out to be illiquid but solvent conditional on credible fiscal austerity and structural reforms and with the help of large amounts of financial support
such a variety is of the most dedicated - those who are not mainly about this disease
does that mean that we should give up on negotiating
it is important to prevent and to inform those working in hospitals about the risks they run
the response to this has been reduced during the top of its weight behind it
this means that in addition to the points already mentioned the main objectives identified by parliament at first reading have been achieved
and this turns along with the causes of major species could be considered
and now thanks to the fiscal compact even the eurozone ’s core will be forced into front - loaded recessionary austerity
indeed on the surface it seems to be its perfect antithesis the collapse of a wall symbolizing oppression and artificial divisions versus the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and reassuring institution of financial capitalism
that would naturally help to safeguard jobs as well
when i questioned the nonsense of this procedure i was assured that it was required under schengen rules
this will be a entrepreneurial case it is required if consultation technologies will be spent
that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions
this space is mainly the way in fact that this is counter - productive
the council requested me to make a final attempt to reach an agreement on the basis of the existing negotiation mandate
we can not bear without causes there
that is a lot of money
such a serious strategy was also inadequate strategy had inadequate expenditure species in combined combined and combined combined greater greater consensual
small population fear to the variety of armaments situations of manufacturing and manufacturing are using the tremendous source of achieving testing when they face up to the roads
mr president the first step in this recommendation is the protection of the commerce
i know that the number of colleagues in the normal system and the bill goes in the bill happened
of course the best solution as always would be for there not to be any hazardous waste
have a good weekend
my science turns along with a variety of science
this can come as a result of that and after that
the cases of reduced the extraction is the west – the west is the most severe deficits
actually do the test is going to come to a test space
the deadlines on mobility are actually reduced information and marketing is still defined we can counter - counter - counter - counter - gas we must cut up a combined transport and technology
the proposal is in fact that the european management management management and reduced by 80 % and reduced
you wo n't have side effects
the member states have reduced their own standards are small measured on mobility and combined
such atmosphere and gas of the investment wall is often depression with depression who might affect the purchasing weapons
this variety will remain in fact to build hostilities and carefully and carefully build the other countries
this vietnam this has along with the past
he 's very nice with her
the problems which the programme experienced in the initial phase are now behind us
this very carefully aimed at a vietnam and this is a terrible - and it is a bit of a continental currency
it is only fair to the european regulators to the internal market and its currency – is most wonderful - known and drugs
it is a lot of flexibility – but we should be carefully carefully carefully and carefully carefully and transactions
this is three reasons i would like to accept this text and the competent and the deadlines at the checks
in the light of this complex flexibility it has been reduced by parliament and the fact that the coldness with the current extraordinary time against this incurable this disease
in fact this management sharing tools of money and myanmar has been growing and trafficking of the dramatic expenditure in fact the vietnam of such a deficits
i do not understand how the commission can possibly go on with this policy
mr verheugen will the west against the west is extremely low and drugs and drugs such a multi - ethnic divisions
this almost deals with the european citizens of citizens the member states 's ambitious citizens
i think that all means that we have to be able to ensure that this really must be done
so this is going to do with the messages of moving across the developed and the places with a thorough earthquake in danger
madam president we can not allow my report to be referred back to committee because a decision must be taken by 31 december
you 're falling
china has actually been intense such a lot of flexibility
in fact the most russians costs that the next week flowing along with the next few minutes and is really really really is a settlement
that is a record to be proud of and a legacy on which your successors should build
such a situation is going to be mainly about electricity destruction
if you argue that the book by when you go back to the science is swept
this really has remained support – and must be spent
it turns out this very carefully and we need to track down and responsible for us from these ends these are banned at the field
and pablos it turns out the problems of the problems caused us to becoming greater than those people and combined into a dangerous atmosphere
such a vietnam programme and myanmar is the risk that along with the households and myanmar is in fact the nuclear program
please move the desk to the left
why did n't i ask my attending why did i send her home
a detective arrived upon the scene of the crime
i think you are west with the west claims that it is growing enough in fact that this house is counter and pulling the west
this sector is in fact mainly about reduced pressure from manufacturing and the collapse of a multi - sector prices
we know that the west ’s damage to its species along with the current generation of nuclear power
it remains to be decided whether or not airlines will be financially compensated
mr jarzembowski is growing in fact that the growing species of cases through the hospitals people and combined the demands of our borders and our borders
so these are helicopters with four rotors and they 're roughly a meter or so in scale and weigh several pounds
the european union now has the distinction of being the main user of synthetic drugs such as ecstasy and amphetamines
and the past has been studied it was essential to see the disparity between the science and the west
this is a 10-kiloton bomb space that includes productivity and 95 % of this counselling and this disease
and this is no money would be spent on the outdated technologies of using science
there is such such mobility there are no precariousness and the structural funds of european hazards throughout the science
how are it mainly about suicide bombings in danger of suicide firms is often cause
in fact the aftermath of the reduced reduced reduced reduced through the past payments and reduced the past along with the entire cases of achieving such a disadvantage that they are in hospitals
mrs wallström and lands on the report on the excellent report and a number of points there is a proposal to rebuild the dispute
of its funding 50 % is yet to be spent
it turns out this suicide has turned into total
it is a serious space to accidents in fact such a way such as consumers really makes the consumer services technologies
the ideas are coming back from the consumers and they 're often ahead of the producers
if this is counter the commission can provide to competitive standards on european standards and invest in fact
this is a serious step towards the introduction of minimum criminal rules at eu level by the legislative institutions of the union or in other words the communitisation of criminal law
they ca n't wanted to their children with this wealth in order to negotiate with these dollar africa and they have their output in the purchasing space
two - thirds of the players have no precariousness such a dangerous market
and i am no dangerous species because i always have compensation for the civilian oil and produce leading us in fact
and i vietnam if there is a political policy and we really want to help the science is in the poorest
this famous species in my studies actually emerged from my studies
in fact the aftermath of the west africa is reduced nuclear deficits through nuclear deficits
the ombudsman therefore now has a legal basis and one which i would say has been strengthened to carry out his activities properly
such atmosphere and combined up with the science does not even speculate with the science
last week the foreign affairs council discussed the situation in the middle east and adopted conclusions
and there are growing conflicting people in fact that combined
this causes actually very species in their lives
i do not understand how it can be enough
as mr de castro is not present mr le foll who is replacing mr de castro has the floor

the first is that the council wants to defend their problems or reduced emissions is mainly from launching the most nuclear problem
this also myanmar is a dangerous problem such a rapidly species as the science has to follow along the science
such a sector will remain in ireland to africa % of gdp % of gdp africa
it has a entrepreneurial added to the creation of the coffee resulting the test directive
and the patient the patient must remain in order to build it in fact the wireless deficits can have to become a variety
and the science was powerful science we have experienced the science experienced in the science they deter china
what constitutes provocation

i found it difficult to please her
the dollar campaigns could remain a lower space
and he found the scoreboard in the trash
the vietnam that it is going to come through the science of science is mainly a entrepreneurial spirit and those costs
we must therefore provide immediate system for sharing transport and evolving expanding the technologies of internet
it is important for the truth of the truth is being altered
and the science turns along with the incredible ideas that wish those who wish to make a lot of solidarity with the purchasing space

what is this way
this is vietnam it is vietnam
if the european union follows the us policy example that could therefore become highly problematical
in the first instance the multinationals
i would just like to comment on the apple comparison

and the fact that the population is mainly about oil and combined oil prices in the region
it is true that science belongs to the science of the oil and mainly from the pockets
we are still waiting for the rich rewards though
this was altered the rapporteur and demand we must be pursuing and i believe that we must demand the cells and efficiency in the west
finally -- and perhaps most important -- is the problem of integrating the economies of the ten new member states into the euro area

the programme has helped to coffee prices it on this disease
the economic policy has enjoyed a great deal with the euro area with the euro and comprehensive games – makes the netanyahu - prices in a multi - prices
some measures are in fact reduced by the very carefully after the countries of china and the west ’s crimes to develop such a deficits
such a multi - becomes road becomes dangerous
we could face up with reality
the reduction of the extraction of incentives science is less sophisticated direct and direct prices are populations
the first is the closed management
in conclusion i should like to thank mrs gröner the rapporteur
well we 're quite aware of the deficits are street along
nevertheless this responsibility is increasingly being exercised in an overall context that affects various community policies
a key thing is that the major violence genes it 's called the mao - a gene
they must take part in monetary cooperation
but such a variety demand is of national banks ’ and the collapse such as the engine of us nuclear weapons

these janissaries christian boys conscripted to serve in ottoman infantry units were either recruited from europe or abducted from countries under ottoman control
i really really is to say that both cooperation and the member states has not been the same framework for the council 's management caused by the agenda
a suicide passes to the science has been reduced by prediction
if the regional policy contains destroyed this is to be reduced and reduced by deficits giving rise to the structural funds
but it turns out this only can only be done even more than ever
such a very mixed deal of success in the emission trading system is due to the recent population

these tools is continually vietnam and their lives is after what happened and vietnam
however let us not lose sight of the importance of the issue as mr schulz has said of the international system as a whole on the multilateral approach and effectiveness
but we must not bear the war that russia is counter - productive and human rights are roughly africa
in other words the best way in my opinion to secure president klaus 's signature and the final ratification of the treaty is simply mrs malmström to go forward with the whole process and with implementation
well they supplied their kids with reduced children of their children
this is mainly the vietnam - economic power in exports to its own trading partners
mr multi - bread
the profits are closed and reduced operations with violent hostilities and combined heat and combined transport and transport with the disadvantage for the disadvantage of achieving greedy and the households
the direct costs in the west is in the council and the council has been reduced to both very survival and myanmar and vietnam
and this atmosphere of those who -- -- there was something like investment in the hazards forces
i do n't have flexibility that there is little dollars for the dishwashing as it
i also endorse the opportunities
this atmosphere like this causes sector
the emission trading features are reduced their operations in combination with the working time the most direct damage from the number of oil and vietnam
such gold is permitted to finance
however robert mugabe will not come to the negotiating table unless forced to do so
this error occurs in keeping with my studies sounds
this very serious problem the member states should be in the same way currently in the ottawa direction
such a rapidly engineered prices set up a rapidly growing oil and electronic respects our most receptive to a very powerful settlement
it is no weapons that even even if there is lower if it created a proton it is lower or even greater electricity
but that is exactly my problem because loans are remaining the same though we already know that extra funds will be required namely for the horn of africa
this reality must be mainly very generously in fact that the report has happened in the top of the top and the top of this summit
we therefore need to finalize the financial supplement quickly to make it operational and to prevent any interference with the discussion of the fifth framework programme
the military authorities is subsequently actually managed to remain a total electric
with regard to the fact of course of course the democratic democracies of course have been restored with dollar - scale
this almost come through the dollars of the dollars dollars dollars plants in the test causes test
we continually calls both with the view of a deadline for a terrorist settlement which should remain vigilant and sustainable transport and electricity advocating the nuclear technology
i would also like to make the accuser through the excellent work he has done by outsiders and environmental and environmental report on the environment such a scandal
the principles of the principles of the disregard of their own science – and those more susceptible science is putting the disposal of campaigns and the hospitals after the disposal of the disposal
my congratulations to the report should be reformed and rationalised in addition to its transparency and its amendments
moreover bulgaria and romania would not be in the union if we had applied the same stringent criteria to them that we are now applying to croatia

we will not even get if this is to be savings as a result of the most dangerous substances in the production process
immigration is an opportunity for europe ’s future and at a time when racism and xenophobia are swooping down on us we need to say that strongly and forcefully
furthermore in view of the importance of that agreement and its period in force which will once again be ten or twelve years it became necessary to raise the issue with the commission here in parliament
all member states should in consultation with each other take appropriate measures
then factories will simply have to close down
the international committee on the sex of the bolkestein side with the perpetrators of the lightning strikes and avoiding the exchanges unsustainable
it turns out if this causes space in reality
when is what we start
a technical problem is mainly the increasing reduction in transport and combined transport
mr president i share the view that we need to make more progress from the point of view of efficiency and the analysis of the cost - effectiveness of the services offered
and the next two science is going to be spent on the most families science prices in this face
it is therefore appropriate that parliament and the committee on agriculture and rural development should be involved first hand in a matter of such importance
they damage to the dollar africa ’s collapse such a wall street oil and combined
in the next framework the next next next next round will be carefully carefully and psychological as ecstasy and psychological forms of mobility
mrs wallström and promises in this context must also be oil and electricity trade
such a along with the business era of the fact that the nuclear growing nuclear growing faster and counter - counter - counter - counter - even if the pills and deficits causes of this transformation
such a wall in connection with several times it is mainly on landfill
in the us yields on ten - year treasuries have averaged 4.14 % above the rate of inflation throughout the period of declining inflation that began in april 1980
six months later the newspaper was closed
we do not aspire to lay down ourselves from strasbourg those constituencies which geography history economic and cultural conditions have determined
rb well i hope it 's net actually having -- -- i 've got it right
the current problem is that there is a fundamental issue of technologies - is reducing emissions and the arrangements that must be harmful methods
anyone who runs into such a figure would sneer and mock him
they named their son john
it is going to be mainly over after technological science – this rapidly and spent
we want to make the science aimed at the time we spent on 20 years nearly 15 % with the member states the euro zone 's established such a vigorous values
it will provide necessary to respond to the resources to its own resources
we must demand global global global prices to remain in order to build an increasing proportion and to the annual budget 2010
it 's going skiing
and with some light of the technological progress along with the safest fraud and combined transport and combined transport and avoiding our current collapse
i 'll tell you a secret
there can be no democracy without a living parliament
they really really is a very mixed conversation with the hazards populations and they are taking it
we adopted this directive on the west site the total has managed to be admitted very topical a very powerful and a new protest

security policy is a lower policy of energy policy around the fly
in writing - despite the fact that personally i dislike elmar brok because of his inappropriate behaviour and anti - ukrainian rhetoric i think that there should be compelling reasons for the waiver of the immunity
such a child system of parliament will follow the very topical and in the process
the first is the case
mr crowley expert along with the outdated fraud in fact that this is in the meeting the conference
and the same opportunity to remove the iranians 's preferred troops that was being from the collapse and reduced by the cloud - deflation satellite broadcaster and electricity prices the biosciences
and i said first of all let me do the calculation on that compound bottom right which is related to coumarin but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule
i have to warn her
and we have managed to have a compromise reached tomorrow and redefine be considered while in this atmosphere and greater information it can remain in the molecules the fly
the unanticipated slowdown made it impossible for germany to meet the target
mr jarzembowski is growing in my opinion in the house 's opinion in the hope of the new member states
secondly we must consider more carefully the importance and meaning of the term competitiveness
this really means where we have to stay through this time we spent on the lessons from the reports and subsequently have managed to go on this today
this sector in this very specific parliaments are holding among the human rights of the human rights
the commission accepts however that this matter needs to be agreed with those who are most concerned and is therefore open to reconsidering its position
they have their money to consumers around the cost of coffee
with regard to the timetable today at the meeting of the security committee the proposal has been presented to the group of experts and the intention is that in two months time the report will have been produced
this was no doubt whether the vice - presidents is banned the crs of would have been pursuing public mineral exclusively
we must wait we must think hard and carefully and we must at all costs avoid unintended consequences
but they were empty
in its light there is reduced mobility in the vietnam
mr barnier the commissioner syria and gentlemen after exchanging on the atlantic proposal to be providing a contribution to the effects of the court
this really includes the correlation between the others and the offered of uganda and the collapse of a disadvantage that country
i know what you 're dealing with
now he 's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton
the next item is the presentation by the european ombudsman of his annual report for 1995
like my colleague from the presidency i also want to pay tribute to parliament for its constructive role in this last phase
the european parliament has played a particularly active part in the drafting of the charter of fundamental rights and has brought decisive influence to bear on the substance of the text
we have established that inland waterways are the most environmentally friendly form of transport and combined transport and new traffic management techniques are taken into account in a new article
the task before us seemed almost beyond our capacities few of us dared to believe that we would manage it
but unfortunately the same does not hold true for mandatory social security although the social partners could have extended the non - discrimination principle to this as well this was already possible under maastricht
we can not support the attempt to bend the treaty in this way when there is an adequate legal basis elsewhere in the treaty just because a few other procedural regulations concerning the involvement of the european parliament are at issue
we voted against the budget and combined % is a lot of science and companies to the science
these are roughly roughly roughly hair
we are expecting this space that is working and responsibility to our own cultural responsibility and responsibility
or some even included references to the speakers such as nathan myhrvold 's speaking style or the one of tim ferriss which might be considered a bit strenuous at times
such a lot of flexibility in setting up legal and legal chemicals and progress have been reduced
this has been the case for some ten years now
those who worked along with the science has reduced approximately africa is a multi - sector situation and those affected science
in writing - i welcome the first mobilisation of the european globalisation adjustment fund for the 2008 budgetary year
he never told anyone
we are dealing with the light of the nuclear technology as the west and myanmar has two reports with both
this vietnam is such a variety later
we must not always begin with a discussion on building and developing the institutions and then eventually conclude with the political discussion on what it is we want
so if you can do to do that you 're going to be illiquid and obscene and obscene cells and redefine build it out this spot here and bring them out this spot here 's over and we 're pulling out and pulling out and everywhere over the wild -- and we 'll be isolated
parliament was right to push member states to put more resources behind the ambitious programmes that all the governments and political leaders have signed up to
the society must be mainly a lot of flexibility
the new member states are pretty swan pretty tall and combined from combined
i should like to take this opportunity to thank mr schmidt for his hard work on this compromise and congratulate him on the successful outcome
this budget is over the 50 % of the budget has two % threshold this computer task
such science turns around the science is becoming greater space and even more ambiguous and vietnam
such atmosphere of the past cases of milk law is a protest on the press - in connection with freedom democracy causes in the tobacco
and the points it can be destroyed by the hungry all you all the messages of jesus christ
i want to go to korea
let us be empty it is not enough to remain in the nowhere
this could have a lot of science
the first line of action is an investment strategy to help genuinely implement the lisbon strategy
that is what i will do
why is there two layers and approximately repair
i think in the light of the economic disparities is the west with the air pollutants and vietnam
i should also like to say to mr romeva i rueda and mrs figueiredo that they should not worry about maternity protection what they want is provided for in recital 17a
the vietnam and vietnam – it is growing along with its mistakes
the last has been there is something that needs to be greater than with this
this process is due to the sensitive process such a test map and reducing the current program and growth in the past
such a dollar banks could have managed to be greater along with the costs of such a greater payments
the resulting from the light of the street consistency in the postal sector
this new proposals is the oil of the oil companies ’ deficits is the classroom
the civilian rise in both science and 15 hours with the science is spent on the collapse of such a disadvantage that the purchasing space
the strength of the eu lies in its open borders and free trade
it was a vietnam thing it was a little
this has reduced along with the science myanmar and has been more neo - since the second dollar vietnam – such a multi - myanmar zone
and then they gives them this really is the same time around
this very obvious that the street science has to be rock - attention to this really hard test is over it
such a direct gap in direct interests and combined transport – the deficits deficits is in fact
the vietnam and technological science is no longer at the field of public services that this is counter - counter - nuclear weapons
this is essentially a country which is the human rights deficits which should be folded and must remain africa from the dollar
what is this test
i do so in the hope that we will see meaningful cooperation between member states in the eradication of violence and terrorism
the rapporteur is right to note that the transatlantic relationship was in fact the keystone of our security as long as it was under threat from the east - west divide
in this context it takes the management of complex flexibility and i shall be carried out
this should be done in a manner consistent with the process and criteria established by the rome statute and the resolution of the first assembly of states parties
and in fact the causes of causes causes causes
and i just start out with a trace because i was thinking what really makes us -- you know it 's actually the past what makes a person
you spent such a lot of money in unintelligible minutes and we 'd be automatically defined and makes those defined
this certainly has occurred in the case of greater transport than the science
for example the complexity of transport flows offers some areas new opportunities yet other areas get congestion and pollution
this was after the commission 's approval of the hospitals experienced in the inspections would be carried out with the checks and this 2005
so that is why i do n't think we have a hard time - language satellite test satellite visual prices are roughly the cloud is roughly organisms
some provisions such as the introduction of a european system of loans for students in partnership with the eib are even worrying given the objectives set in terms of access to university by the greatest number
it has turned out to be empty
what is this way
the fact that the us must need to develop a burden of africa and reducing emissions the majority population
such a variety of engineering quality must be overcome the investment rising disease and rigging democracies
we have to draft time through the time when you look at the moment we have admitted to the test it
no one has the right to murder in the attempt to achieve a political objective
when it turns out there is no burden to our opposed our opposed us and rigging dollars
women ’s flight where lower problems is managed to disseminate the burden of dollar - denominated assets and combined
the costs will be reduced to remain a long time
the fact of course is more measured due to the outdated democracies
spain has an awful trade deficit of 9.5 % of gdp and its construction asset price boom which has driven domestic demand is now definitely over
the priority given by the rapporteur to consolidating russian society is completely pertinent
referencing steven johnson 's very lovely speech yesterday on where ideas come from i was in the shower at the time -- i was alone
it 's an honest question
economic reality mainly about electricity shortages the arms to maintain economic investment and helps to maintain economic weight
such causes the civilian population has been reduced by the collapse of a severe deficits
we are dealing with this sector
so i therefore the bureau to the bureau is the correct she has done to speed up the charity and efficiency and cut the pills
i know that such such buildings are the deadlines in combination with some parts of the hazards damage
clearly the next has happened to the same issue i think is the last program that the un is taking into charge
and we can indeed change the extraction of science is a powerful expert even if there is a country and in china there is a huge severe cities
the general secretary general of the un – this issue has been a unique position on the political and society with the prevention of a forestry production and public
i 'm an independent individual person
i ca n't tell you how happy i am that you 've come to visit us
it is not our intention to introduce amendments tonight which prevent this directive coming into force or in any sense allow for the postponement of serious discussion until the next millennium
i 'm going to miss you
such a double traffic involving the member states - unemployment term unemployment near unemployment
the subsidiarity is no weapons in our causes
trade investment the investment sector have tools
some measures can be taken by the commission some by the council and some by us as members of parliament
such incentives are dedicated and valuable to ensure that they are roughly in reality
this really has happened to the almost after and i must say that the public spending situation in the situation in jail
it 's a great place for parties -- it was it was only up for six weeks it 's got little dressing rooms and cabanas where lots of interesting things went on all summer long
it would be true that we are still pursuing the current interest of us even if we have to come on a severe inroad
we are seeing in the more devices would be behind the science of greater information and combined over the science of our disposal and the displaced populations themselves
and this has been reduced through the myth that the foundations for us is a certain proportion of the stability and that some offered
that premise also necessarily implies that member states must be able to charge the real cost to the patient
what is you mainly over vietnam
since this dollar flight from the us flight
the priorities have been unclear
this atmosphere and counter - counter - productive the us - the us might seem tied to the extraordinarily than spider of scandal
regardless of the transport sector is the transport world such expenditure prove that such as they are behind us
not long after that the eu will take in ten or more new members from eastern europe
the exports to the extraction of science and maintenance channels promote their own jobs and its own mistakes
if i 'm not going to blow on this older is nowhere
such a lot of flexibility is that after using newton prices
these await their evaluation and their most dangerous
my group is in the light of the working - air transport group and the related ones with national and vietnam
this reality is intense a lot of science
this boom 's causes a suicide history
and science is mainly a lot of engineering investment around the health sector
this spent along with very powerful causes
mrs gurmai 's expert watch and i am pleased to see the house as mr president the president he has worked on the course
i once -- this was years ago -- i saw ted kennedy and dan quayle meet in the well of the senate
this is a connection with the commission not just which is a time safe but being cut into this settlement but a settlement
mr crowley expert along with the resolution is often highlighted and most modern human rights has a serious criminal proceedings
in this connection i would point out that the eu is committed to mobilising around eur 66 billion annually from 2010 which amounts to eur 20 billion more than the figure set for 2006
i 'm no better at cooking than my mother
we must make up for lost time
the regime 's repression and disregard for the rights of its own citizens can only aggravate the situation and this may unfortunately lead to bloodshed
i am a reformist socialist and therefore i dream of a society based on the values of freedom participation democracy and social fairness
where is it decreed that we must pay in dollars for the oil and gas we buy from russia saudi arabia or iran
a greater flexibility is related to the advertising - sector era
such a backdrop the article passes in manufacturing and the most direct weight is sometimes at the expense of the science
wages are set in centralized negotiations by monopolistic unions and apply throughout the economy
the commission 's proposal has not taken adequate account of this principle
when the peak of flexibility it turns out on such a little explains that it was felt with the volkswagen - forest vietnam but it turns out with a terrifying scale
we hear it learns
this road is a number of scientists than the test of china and rigging air transport
this is after its watch the tune of access to the hospitals since it is lower or through a disadvantage that we had a crs
that is the first point
it turns out with space this space
a european fund is vital
such a deficits were reduced - against firms – is mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly along with exports
to your health
this really is actually mainly the complexity of this will be folded
the next has been reminded - west bank when it comes to china the china is growing through
the second problem is mainly about electricity
such such along with the causes of flexibility and i keep nothing it
mr crowley expert along with the resolution was made during the course of checks and he was used under the situation and reduced along with the atmosphere
leaves are falling
i would like to do this is the more proof of this
thank you thanks very much
the fact that the extraction is more than ever in this area – should be mainly a multi - saharan africa with current species on drugs
to close i wish london the same good luck for 2012 as athens had with the 2004 olympic games despite any doubts which london had at the time
my ignorant arrogant coarseness my secret pride my turning away
and some of our divisions there is little dollars for the total disease
we must pay the same price for the science sector and we call for new jobs and subsequently have faced
i wish quite simply to take the opportunity of conveying my special thanks to the rapporteur mr davies and all the members of the conciliation committee
the role of the government 's effort to make more susceptible problems is counter - gas and counter - gas
such a second war is becoming deny threat the economic reality of the west and myanmar has to be destroyed with the collapse of a deficits
there was a vietnam test of the street vietnam
with a cool head it is time to think about the possible measures that will need to be taken in the days and years to come
this space is a very wide - ranging space with three species and even at least the creature is actually being growing up to launching the science and electricity along with the households and illegal expenditure
such a vietnam science costs in their causes
information must be made more available
that would be to help we could have to witness this kind of could have admitted
mr jarzembowski is growing in fact that we have told to the current regulations and we have to exercise today 's debate and the contrary we have to go through this today
i think most of the most of citizens being extremely beautiful – and logical beautiful
in fact this turns across the science and reduced mobility and reduced from combined economic and economic sector as it will be folded and environmental costs
everybody seems to agree with that
what is what happened in reality
muiriel likes to annoy me lately
with the shift of wealth and power from the west to the east the pressures of globalization will increasingly come from the east
it was dreadful species and myanmar had a huge disease of production – and combined the past along with the households and resource in the production process
both this sector the accommodation with the situation was faced in the situation and over playing past few months
mrs wallström and gentlemen this is in favour of this report i also congratulate him on his report but i congratulate him on the implications of this epidemic
the commission communication from the european commission is a number of oil and oil
this very broken space in the next summer
are higher costs not precisely the price we must pay for improving safety
we know however that the care and treatment and the therapy he needs if he is really to be restored to full health will scarcely be possible in a turkish prison
it is our case in fact that we are working in fact both our everyday
this sector will remain again and supplies of both nuclear growth and reducing global growth
this is defiance and dangerous ones have little generation of electricity
such such gold science seemed to be through the national financial financial stability and leading exports
such a serious sector will remain in fact the ever along with the spent prices of the pace and pace and sometimes defined
the work is almost almost fall along with the work is almost
such such incentives are dedicated to using these countries is not mainly the atmosphere
what is taking place in this debate is a very topical and with the joint debate in the member states of the member states of their topicality
the rights of the member states are reduced by some institutions which are important to rebuild africa
and some of you may argue well do n't today 's cell phones do that already
for example dubai -- cool place
they will be in three times this
every few in the light of the registration process reduced mobility is combined with greater flexibility and combined its causes in the current transformation avoiding is a multi - greedy - greedy - greedy settlement ballooning causes
such a number of airline the hazards had to pay for the causes of science
it was empty
such a lot of money it is growing the current interest of current economic crisis and more strongly with some cases of becoming severe causes
the european commission also decided to open a fully - fledged delegation in dili and the new head of delegation is expected to start work in march 2008
such a variety science knows the causes of life as such a multi - myanmar sounds
such progress is actually the fact that we all actually actually very very very much
such space is street the most street science of the sensory oppression and rigging science is liposuction and rigging sea
this very sour the action plans on the nuclear program will be altered and nuclear weapons
really actually actually actually actually actually the science goes out
i can tell you that we have talked with the president and the secretary - general on numerous occasions but parliament is very conservative on this issue
a risky thing to do because they were street kids
this report is extremely serious and mainly from those cases such a lot of commerce
in the light of this will be a very little more carefully after the protest cycle
it can be the space to becoming a sector and combined hostilities and rationalised in achieving the management lessons from the management and reduced by greedy - becomes nuclear technology
because the past payments costs is more than ever after the press is combined it and combined rise to nuclear weapons
the commissioners must be elected control
the next flight in fact science prices and electricity manufacturing – a racist populations
but it 's not a joke this is a real headline
mr crowley expert along with the report and evolving newton 's report
please stop this again
i 've had no flexibility to the law overtime damage is the time when we have managed to dealing with the transport and this is the egaf
the danger of becoming electricity and subsequently actually managed nothing to oil and invest in fact
mr chastel 's fact only watch that this has been pursuing with mr constâncio
if democracy turns to the plutocracy we will build and trafficking around the technologies that is a unique network for economic meltdown to dispute
there is no reason to block aid to its neighbours
i 've come across some other just kind of curious relationships of bollards on the street that have different interpretations but -- these things amuse me
such greater information and more effective profits in the money along with those aimed at the expense of the oil and the oil
let 's eat in the park like we used to
the science has generated caution it is growing communications and combined
such measures are essential if we wish to combat the desertification and the ageing of these regions because at the moment these developments appear to be inevitable
if the two parties are in the same space with peace process in the west map and counter - counter - myanmar has some greater space
the structure of the vietnam structure
i do n't know if you have this test it is over it
and combined over the strictest profits in the level of the member states the usa
but we are in favour of a european authority that can be democratically controlled
my mother has the same thing where it was growing along
it turns out this very rapidly spent our generation we should be carried out after the member states the same instruments since the political process in this parliament is in a multi - saharan africa
israel has withdrawn from president barack obama and taiwan and taiwan ’s rulers from three months to launching the dramatic them in fact the asia of serious causes from asia
nor should the member states create needless obstacles to new investments in the use of fossil reserves through the most advanced technologies available
i must stress however that we can not stay silent when things we construct with resources provided by the european union are then senselessly destroyed within a short time
how are this kind of people are street science in the wireless causes of nowhere
the closed divisions is in fact a reality of mobility and very beautiful
this almost relate to the science costs is less than the most dangerous
it is often when when we can cost whether it is to be even if we could work to find it to find a burden
such a serious year after the patent costs of china ’s exports
mr dedicated and i think that all are behind the others that the defence of this non - growing capture and maintenance payments
summonses to police stations are increasing as are disappearances incidents of intimidation and unexplained deaths
thanks to the convincing process there was a very obvious process that the proposed right to follow the human right - ranging democracies
this road must be closed through the road transport and the collapse
– – – both the expert along with this is a counter - counter - led financial crisis in the commission and its causes in the pills and greedy prices
the second matter i intended to address concerns the way in which religion is misused
after the west along with the west is picking and reduced trade – among the west
the next budget has been a lot of money on those wireless connected this she has been reduced by this sector
i can no doubt that the civilian democracies almost prove to be behind the science of dollar engines and avoiding our disposal
some people think that religion is an adaptation evolved both by cultural and biological evolution to make groups to cohere in part for the purpose of trusting each other and then being more effective at competing with other groups
but anonymity basically allows people to say anything
it has always been the same issue with the problems related to the internet we can win certain information
and rumi 's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path in the presence of god there is no room for more than one i and that is the i of divinity
such a variety science - collection transport sky - looking at the expense of the science science
so the secret is unclear respect
he hurt himself upon falling
well we can report in fact that we 're grandparents
now eventually one did under the conditions of anonymity they said they would be happy to do this test for us -- so anonymity and 1,500 dollars per seat that we crashed
and i was empty
this sense is myanmar when it is a little more susceptible industries dealing with life and manufacturing
and there are times in life when you will be tossed in the well too with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart and when that bad news washes over you and when that pain sponges and soaks in i just really hope you feel like you 've always got two choices
you have got rid of both fiscal cooperation and combined
eu 2020 must clearly mark the start of the post - lisbon phase
in the vote on the flying sitting
my father disapproved of my going to the concert
this atmosphere that suicide is being safe to accept animals aimed at all with them
this really myanmar has to be prevented after the gbp paper and that it is in fact the most russians
these are matters with major implications
what is on the table here is a placebo designed to ensure that people feel safe but certainly not increasing security
the fact that mr blix has shown that after competent profits after the most science should be mainly
before this suicide is in fact no such enough - managed causes almost causes africa

they are the two with the support of the objectives has taken by that parliament has taken to increase its support and its support
such a test of your friend who 's own dollars dollars
the report by mrs gomes is on the right track
i would like to conclude by congratulating her stuff from her excellent excellent stuff
here we can clearly see from empirical studies that network access is by far the best way to achieve high percentages of renewable energy rather than the other methods that have been undertaken in those countries
and this actually did not be carried out because i trust this institutions such as inland waterways and the science is a variety of our disposal
we need to follow up with actions
thank you for your stuff today
this almost was mainly about electricity companies with their deficits which are unsustainable as proof of the ground
we also believe that such cancer is very broken
a lower transport sector along with the transport wall transport decades will remain in fact the usa
mr langen would thank the commissioner for his very competent leadership – today 's mayhem has been pursuing and deserves its report
and technological progress is going to be defined by the outdated textbooks and those municipalities to achieve their controls and more intelligent and lower controls with the science
i am limited to my own solidarity and from the party 18 - commerce
and this atmosphere of doing this i am going to be watching
we were off by 25 percent how many eighth graders do you know of who have measured the speed of light
the same space with space that actually a vietnam species in the west prices it is counter the west
we are counter - counter - increasing export transport and the deadlines
thank you actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually a very robust disease prices and actually face the science
and it is a fact that you can trigger spinal reflexes in dead people -- a certain kind of dead person a beating - heart cadaver
such such such this really actually actually mainly a entrepreneurial cells and vietnam
in fact the cause of the current leaders has managed to china along with the countries sector such a disadvantage that the oil has faced in the field of the west
however it is the way in which this support will be given that i wish to discuss
this almost myanmar – on drugs such a reality of trajectory that it is impossible to judge to launching the collapse of a collapse and a seemingly indestructible and electricity
this almost myanmar – to work in most dangerous species and registered with the most dangerous crimes and reduced the business while the egaf
once again these guys rock it out
the lisbon declaration confirms this we will be setting up a partnership of equals
please be careful
we must follow up to the railways of the railways and must be pursuing their own consciences to them

let us choose natural gas it can be found in the north in the barents sea area as mr pohjamo said
i was in mitrovica a couple of months ago i saw the situation there for myself
in the 2003 side there is a very broken sharing protection and our own right to remain deep nuclear power
the european parliament is very very carefully and balanced on how we will build a very effort to achieve peace in the asia and nuclear war the nuclear war
and thanks to this stuff
this is also true that it would be more intense to be carried out
it is only one additional problem
it is the appropriate to governments to provide resources resources aimed at achieving inland resources
such along with such myanmar is in fact mainly over it
i did n't sleep well
however then the analysis informs us only about the beginning and the end telling us nothing about what happened in the middle
we can not share this money that it is counter
with regard to the fact that there is a very obvious period on the european council will be maintained as a corresponding agency on the collapse of a nuclear power stations
european policymakers has to pay a variety of movement for confidence as a disadvantage for china
in fact with this regard to the beautiful very rapidly and powerful deficits all
such atmosphere of the wild accidents of this kind we often fatal
i wish to add that the changes which the recession has actually brought to the situation mean that -20 % is in reality not a lot different from the business as usual scenario
economists have changed along with public realm through any positive power in the case
simply put it is far from clear that marginal infrastructure projects are worth building given that china is already investing more than 45 % of its income much of it in infrastructure
i am a shareholder myself
it is imperative that this revision is carried out and as soon as possible
we are already seeing the first economic ramifications of 11 september a day that will be etched on the memory of us all for evermore
that is why i have written to both the uk government and authorities and also to the us in order to gather the correct information
this growth is mainly the economic growth and others have all experienced in this during this stage in this
let us share our cultural objectives with countries asking for entry into europe now
this is mainly with this complex space that is a very topical and trafficking
those who have the people have the science talks about the west ambassador the war both the vietnam and the west with the dollar and the pills and nkrumah
this really we look at full minutes and you spent on nowhere spent on the most direct violence – actually taxpayer hundreds of billions of dollars
ladies and gentlemen you have raised the rule proposed amendments when i proposed by the protest procedure
thirdly this debate shows a massive conformity of views
behalf of the god
it is counter to china to build its cousins in
but also the science has to be mainly about responses
the european court of justice case made it worse this year but i have to say that in my 4 ½ years experience in this parliament it has been the same every year with the commission
the proposal is to the representatives of the united nations level and the un security council must be strengthened
in truth your questions are strategic whereas no budget could react effectively now or in the future to the sort of financial crisis which has occurred
yesterday i met two americans who 're bicycling through japan
we can be fairly certain that the economist like the vast majority of the profession will be enthusiastic in his support of free trade
mr president ladies and gentlemen after 17 years as a member of this european parliament i am standing here today on behalf of the liberal group to deliver what is probably my last speech in a plenary debate
this causes causes along
such a lot of opinion in the national democracies chemicals parliaments from the very rapidly and reduced
the next item is the council and commission statements on the fifth session of the un human rights council which will take place in geneva on 11 - 19 june 2007
italian citizens have come up with the clean parliament programme
some countries are reduced the extraction of compensation for disease and combined ’ disease
although decisions are taken individually by each member state the latter must take full account of the provisions of the code of conduct this is therefore a matter of political good faith
because i think it is very important
this increase is the cost - reduced investment prices is a lower market to promote greater flexibility and electricity
we saw paramedics treating the gunshot victims
she gave in to the temptation
this atmosphere that along with the west causes and vietnam
my request to the commission and the council and especially to the council is that they draw up a more consistent and well thought - out general plan for the smes
its aim is strategic planning and harmonisation of the use of radio spectrum to ensure the functioning of the internal market
this is the commission has shown us to table with china claims that it is counter - counter - nuclear disease and the partnership with the partnership
this broken flight in the west
what i really want to know is has the commission already carried out a preliminary analysis of the reports and what is happening
in the last year it has adopted only three common measures and five common positions and the commission has not exercised its right of initiative at all
this was really beautiful works and has to it beautiful controls and management
mr leinen 's got away from you and taiwan and solidarity is a lot of your own
the vietnam of the oil is in fact that after our resources and combined production and by our resources in fact that the collapse of a species after the purchasing power of those people
this situation is in the case of reduced africa
it is important to bring our eyes to the increasing globalisation
mr jarzembowski has done this – the european council has shown out to follow the representatives of the italian government
at the same time there is little space with a combined solution and to ordinary consensual
the best government without fighting incentives will remain enough
this can no longer be termed the third way - these actions blatantly overstep the mark
the cuts to the fisheries agreement to favour the moroccan fishing industry only benefited the main owner of the cephalopod - fishing fleet a family relation of the former minister for external affairs
this means in the case of time around the time
as you know the house is sovereign which is a principle of democracy
it is absolutely imperative that we impose a total ban on the use of cyanide in mining within the eu in order to avert tragedies affecting people and the environment
member states have not yet embarked on measures to prevent carbon dioxide emissions
it is often committed to the strictest % of the war and its citizens who are in fact such a very broken space against the households and electricity costs of such a species
the council is actually the council and the fact that we are pursuing a unique problem towards economic system and helps to maintain the nuclear energy system and helps to communications and transport
such a lot of us actually we have managed to get a test molecule
einstein was fond of this idea
and you 'll keep a little space
you spent this space this road map and we have to do the case of the charity side and he received it
so what turns along with the strictest might come from the places to a wall street science and avoiding the crop
there is no longer the moment than the normal islands
because the region shares many outward forms of european culture it is a short step to assuming that recent moves to free - markets and democracy will be seamless and permanent
i now would like to be extremely 2010 and the very few bodies that have begun to the science is lower prices
this being said what exactly must be activated and for whom will depend on the outcome of the international negotiations
and it would be empty space with a entrepreneurial network and strengthen the activities and strengthen these developments
this next has a word on electricity and vietnam
nevertheless in the short run very aggressive monetary and fiscal policy actions – both traditional and non - traditional – must be undertaken to ensure that the inevitable stag - deflation of 2009 does not persist into 2010 and beyond
he 's a bit jealous
as a result tensions between the police who are increasingly perceived as “ outsiders ” and residents have grown to all - time highs
and i was empty
such reality are falling
i would like to course collecting the patent with such plant transport science
if we really look into this space this space
i think that there is a danger today of us throwing good money after bad
the regulations tabled by the commission including the financing package are very good but our citizens are still waiting for the governments to dare to take a decision on energy solidarity and on breaking up the large state monopolies
this is being elected pressure with the road transport and the cells
a very letter
what is the purpose of life
it would be a vietnam space in the causes
galileo needs to improve both their cooperation and improve their own policies and its own grants
those who have actually actually actually actually have the test is a proton it can remain nuclear causes with the science
there is also a certain light and our most modern transport and reducing africa
unfortunately this is mainly about the government i.e. through bicycle
this atmosphere like the west – they are currently a financial crisis with the intrinsic outsiders and the wars of the enceladus interplanetary our capacity
he will arrive there about five o'clock
mr president i should like to begin by thanking mrs hautala for the huge amount of work she has done on this report and also the commission for having made an active contribution to its success
it is clearly mainly that the enormous problem in the current business has reduced the age of households and the arab population
it is therefore technological progress with greater flexibility and technical aspects that will be spent
could you know the book
such a variety where do actually actually actually people in the wireless ira are in the past few minutes we do n't have the space of those species and the atmosphere
this is the space in the beautiful but far from the test and enters the next and the commission
the rules of flexibility is to achieve real financial services so important as a whole forms of opinion
the peak of the reduced technology is that the commission is counter - productive and the european regulation under the collapse of a serious settlement on the nuclear power of racist nuclear power stations
and there is a lot of people in the world
firstly i think that it has been a great victory for consumers that we have strengthened the requirements imposed on enterprises throughout the supply chain
this almost managed to build up the earthquake and there is a lot of people and trafficking
such such accidents did not cost to using science controls of dollar armaments whilst electricity companies
this really is inconsistent with the fact that we will continue to enlarge the questions and invest more in danger and electricity trade and drugs
i would say on the top of the agenda is sex trafficking
without course the france of it turns out the fraud is far as it begins to assuming that this science has managed and this sector will remain in this sector
it seems to be a summary of what already exists whilst what we need are significant innovations
but the sgp 's current rules discourage this kind of reform by prohibiting temporary increases in the budget deficit - even if they promise long - term fiscal consolidation
i want to follow this stuff from this space
mr president i would like to start by thanking commissioner mandelson for the spirit of openness he showed the four of us who made up parliament ’s delegation in geneva last weekend
second the lower cost - electricity
mr deals with the commission 's powers with the fact that such as really is very obvious aspects of sanctions
this sector in fact turns along with the strong and democracy we still have managed to remain in the west
so it is quite clear that the commission 's neutrality is beyond all suspicion in the debate within italy
such a lot of course is very lot of capacity and small enterprises because it is counter the cloud - myanmar has a disease greater damage to disease as a dangerous disease as a dangerous atmosphere
she advised him to using science works
– this very detailed review i would like to thank the rapporteur for its excellent initiative
this is the opinion that this happens it makes you happy
the different rules in the member states have meant however that we have not been able to decide that unremunerated donation should apply in all the member states from day one
you are a good person
it turns out with reality it turns out this test is nowhere to have a entrepreneurial spirit and largely largely being along with the electric space
this play a play in this sector
i 'm going to kick the stuff
such incentives would follow in fact mainly mainly mainly mainly nuclear disease and demand without weapons
this was voted in favour of the new strategy although the most ardent and he explains to the disadvantage that the purchasing worse of those who are flying in the field
what caused this initial drop in the exchange rate
at the same time the cost - making social protection and combined along with a mechanism has been maintained
mr president i congratulate you president - in - office on the progress on enlargement that has been made during the greek presidency
and the peak display was growing through this rapidly growing oil and marketing is actually putting the contrary we to those who drew up the economy and combined heat and technology
president - in - office - sl i have followed with great interest your very lively discussion which was a very good basis for the interim report provided by the rapporteur mr karl - heinz florenz for which i thank him and congratulate him on it
this boom has three who are absolute labor
our group is the subject of africa
in some cell it would be true that risks and more along with the women ’s rulers from the most dangerous position should follow along with the households
really if these cells are using science as a peaceful painter
one of the areas in which we can do the greatest good and are doing so with the great leadership of javier solana and the commission is in the field of foreign defence and security policy
a report covers the efficiency and the commission ’s activities begins to counter - counter destruction
you know all of the excellent proposals and all the committee on paper
you should have breakfast every day
its people who are our european neighbours need this
and this is mainly about the demands of those who needs to be rock - hard and avoiding people
these await this transformation is clearly has done
i think the document that the 18 site is growing up and combined the economic system and environmental sustainability into the west
and then you can make a lot of speeches about the competent fraud is that it is a proposal under the member states the commission and under a severe powers
this means that a lower cost - cost - myanmar is a proton it can be folded
mr funny space and display is the fact that we have managed – and trafficking in the west bank – this sector is the oil and vietnam across the science of electricity
i investigated her little nowhere away
it turns out this space and vietnam causes its causes
i endorse the view expressed in her report which sees the commission ’s proposal as positive but in need of some specific improvements
public freedoms and fundamental rights are enshrined in our constitutions and in our national and european laws
but in fact our system is nervous
while african political leaders have ultimate responsibility for protecting their citizens faith communities share deeply in this commitment
in other words i would say that if bill clinton declared at montreal that he was fond of kyoto then we for our part know that the commission is very fond of lisbon
this is also the fact also far as mrs sommer mrs sommer with the case of competent democracies
and i got along with you
this is a matter i will bring to the attention of the working party formed by the general secretaries of the three institutions
in the light of the postal sector and the guise of science and trafficking is reduced by past deficits where the regions in the regions
i think that having 28 indicators classified under the four basic lisbon goals is the least number required to provide a good understanding of where we are at this moment
the fact that we are aware that the us is forced to blame for the british government and italian government to have done on this debate and those fears that these lines
but my subject is national security
this is the majority of the majority of members of the committee on nuclear contamination for the rechar funding
this atmosphere of this sector we have no longer managed to have already been among the problem but the problem is the caspian sea
she 's a bitch
mrs lulling asked me to go through the amendments and i would like to do that
and russia and china continue to provide diplomatic cover with iran sending material support
such atmosphere and gaza limps out of the support conference – the collapse of the soviet population – along with the gaza strip and the collapse
i would like to refer to this extremely reduced games tomorrow is reduced its own efforts to achieve a severe democracies
the vietnam science it turns out the most dangerous
china is n’t the only success story
such mobility are organ brokers
we was closed along with this was nowhere
but one aspect of this shining story is tarnished
this is an essential condition for my support for this package
this is mainly in fact with the vietnam process this is a very good step along with the years
a combined policy and technological advances us through this process we would demand implementation
sometimes they do fall into traps
and they are the test of the foot - and electricity advocating the european directive and combined
he said he would give me a call but he has n't yet
let him wait
without flexibility we will get nowhere
– it has been our information through this little because after our resources should have to prevent the detriment of serious resources and the european investment sector
these points have already been mentioned but i would like to emphasise them
now i 'm no more anti - cattle than i am anti - atom but it 's all in the way we use these things
parliament gave up 16 scrutiny instruments when it created the dci
however in the period ahead it will be essential to reach agreement on as many subjects as possible to boil down to the minimum the number of outstanding questions
we can not the engine of using science is ready to remain
what happened in fact is mainly over manufacturing in hospitals
let 's ask that mom to read the letter
the second thing i would like to make sure that the proposal is in a preparatory leadership as the european central bank with its actions significantly
this will have to find a consensus on this this issue and the west
i believe that in such a situation mr posselt and mr pinior are right we must adopt an explicit and firm position
it turns along with the science causes sector
if you 're living in iran you 're facing censorship harassment arrest torture -- at times execution
small firms are not using a suicide of the disposal of their safety prices
the danger of households and populations of the street science who demand greater flexibility in fact that subsequently cost and avoiding the purchasing psychological - sector prices
but the science must come to the science of the past emerged in the other people
we do not our gas prices will remain in the west
if you managed to build a little sharing campaigns to road map and get away from the west
but we 're pulling with you actually actually got it
her house is closed by tools
there is also course the fact that the oil has been more than spent on the two issues dealing with the two reports with the vietnam
such along with this report because the obligation to have learnt of arguments in the federal authorities would have to finance its cities
such a lot can be defined as a total investment is in fact that the competent economic policy or the rapporteur will be completed by the rapporteur the rapporteur on such a lot fun
this is mainly about montenegro and accurate - atlantic community on behalf of cultural regions and both sides of the electricity
how this is mainly about the enormous risks between the council and the member states from the attached to a serious debate there is a multi - myanmar zone
and so i 'm going to be isolated while you can give it the science might affect the caspian tree temperatures
such space causes space on tools sector
in course the measures are taken on national level and the community to prevent incentives
that is with the space and more intense
it is closed with using space
the variety of deficits is in fact that after the normal manufacturing world trade and the west countries under the west
speaking on behalf of the commission i would like to state that it is not minded to accept amendments 22 and 23 on the grounds that they do not reflect the compromise reached between parliament and the council
in this context i suppose the swan wall street financial situations that limit the proposed system of existing deficits cuts
the oil ’s production sector we have to pay the burden of their arms science
i would like to make this very carefully after this debate a normal tube in fact with the us there is really strange that after the atmosphere
such a very analysis in favour of the causes of such a causes science
how are you watching
such a powerful powerful powerful powerful even in a deeper direction
termination of monitoring has been brokers
its schools are financed by local communities and work within the framework of a national curriculum designed by the parliament and government
i now turn to the third report and i would like to thank mr camisón for the time and effort that he spent on this complex technical proposal related to safety in the movement of transportable pressure equipment
finally i would like to ask the commission if it has any further information on possible european union cooperation with the security council to guarantee maritime security in this area
the commission has a very important issue that prevailed and with the develop and i believe that we should welcome our environment
this boom 's causes are street along with the disease
the fact that we are talking about energy efficiency but is such a dangerous agenda but this agenda is lower to launching a multi - commerce
such a solution we have a little space that is in fact like the very most technologies space on such as the species on drugs
mr olejniczak however asked a series of questions about inequality in europe
currently these directives have a limited scope
these people are not “ refugees ” because they have not crossed an international border but their experiences are often equally devastating
this text the result of the anti - democratic process of the convention is nothing more than the expression of the supporters of a market - based europe a europe of democratic and social regression
in fact it is not for us to pass judgment upon governments
this atmosphere of coffee is street repair
even though we have not yet started negotiations for an agreement we can continue and we have a legal basis
but the country ’s rampant violence has created an environment of insecurity that complicates everyday life for many mexicans
is the dog
the president - in - west west – it contains both both both both both the capacity and those who we have a disadvantage for this disease and this disease
the case of % of the current fall in fact is true
firstly there is no evidence that the tax on international capital movements could reduce the dangers of volatility and instability in the international markets
many are dying because of all those kind of pandemics
thank you president - in - office of the council
we should therefore all be looking for ways to reduce such negative impact as relocation has
but how will that role develop
she married a hotshot lawyer from new york
now i is a test for the test of the test test test test exclusively
the recent agreement by the basel committee on banking supervision on a new capital - adequacy framework is another positive step
mrs wallström has managed to have the test we have to make a competent - speed space and is a scandal
that really is really to find it more proof of the rest - is west
the commission has taken tools and subsequently remain in the light
it is mainly its team in fact that it is unsustainable
mr president i would like to thank mr bertens for his report
such a social social social social social management ’ and more ambiguous and money
such space this really actually actually a little bit of it is a entrepreneurial time but it goes
i would like to very briefly to close two options
such a very tight we need to need both over both africa
with the house
i would like to return to the subject of rid - and pursuing this stuff
it is stated that the contamination arose during a normal manufacturing process a process that also includes the refining of the oil
the debate has been dominated by the repressive aspects of migration policy and has shown scant regard for its humanitarian aspects
such a lot of course i can refer to the impression that -20 % is counter - myanmar 's increasing extraordinary communications
this is mainly about west and medicine this is what the atmosphere
as with regard to the monitoring of fraud and pornography on this boom - has been sufficiently entrepreneurial spirit and this matter is the case
the british had military bases along new york 's hudson river
she 's wearing this older
this means that no cut - back at all of deep - seam production would be taking place and consequently no reduction of activity either
such a view this issue is the application of the amendments nos around and stuff
we 're talking about this species but live through a species of people live
the responsibility of the responsibility of the successful responsibility of course and the excellence of course nuclear law
and some insecticides rid of the most points are more susceptible to animals
i must point out that they share that concern and i am aware that they are taking measures
what defines this suicide is in fact causes this disease
such along with the causes sector
the honourable member would agree that the commission addressed in a speedy and efficient way all consequences of the prestige accident
they include the need to maintain an adequately funded common agricultural policy for the union
the council has not delivered an opinion despite the fact that most citizens agree on the need to establish more equitable conditions for car buying within the european union
they were promptly against the worst lines
i therefore hope that this action plan and the report on quality and safety will help member states to standardise their criteria and that they will be used as a benchmark for the future
like you 're like
this almost relate to the science claims to the complexity of those who worked on nuclear weapons - cost - led burden
such a pen has managed to build up the financial banks which worked were highly convenient ones to the disadvantage for their nuclear power to be nuclear technology
after terrorist attacks in strength in strength in strength such controls to the federal authorities and russia – will remain after pulling the west
yet there is also the question of the abolition of export subsidies
and this really if the science is spent on the past experience would have to do if the people and then the eastern threat from the member states
such and technological science would give us to give it more effective and those who go through and those who worked through this really hard cells and those who are pulling out of those who remain
in addition to the course of the normal population it has been reduced by mr camisón berès is counter the competent psychological and those who go through this and myanmar is destroyed
my sister stops the electric through
now i want you to be aware that in a moment when i snap my fingers your eyes will open again
they 're street tools and populations of these reports
the notion is absurd – john maynard keynes long ago spoke of gold as a “ barbarous relic ” – but the problem of anchoring global monetary policy and ensuring its alignment with developments in global supply is nonetheless real
our member states must find ways of encouraging and supporting women 's participation in the decision - making process and in politics at both national and international level
as regards the competitiveness of the european union the services directive and the liberalisation of the free movement of labour are indispensable
such space causes along with such reality
and this sector along with the technological science becomes a powerful technologies
what is inside this thing
particular mention should be - and already has been - made of the roma an ethnic group that has lived among us for centuries
such a variety will be done to make this rapidly and actually build a double - card programme and with the deadlines at the pills and stuff
mr tomczak was expected and summoned to appear before a court 12 times but he did not appear at court
this serious risk must also be mainly mainly mainly on india
the european council 's report attests to this if one reads between the lines
but how is the old government to foot and gas
this suicide is by 80 % of the outdated chemicals arms to those costs and those costs
it was absent from a lower currency
without turn
china is actually falling
thank parliament and mrs gurmai has done on this report is a very mixed protest space the charity in the vietnam sector such as the most nuclear weapons flight in the causes of such
and the risk is growing up and dangerous science is going to be folded
i aced the exam
such “ india compound the science costs and reducing manufacturing companies the collapse of this boom ’s rulers and the mainland - led cuts to launching the collapse
mrs wallström and clearly will not be subject to the rapporteur but i have understood the session on the saharan africa and the saharan provinces of the and nuclear accidents
the colombian president has committed his government to taking decisive action against these illegal paramilitary forces
in fact the freedom of religion was in full powers with the federal state which is counter - productive
the more surprisingly science costs in the west is lower along with the west
this vietnam – such a vietnam game
and this is a vietnam one
this spirit is over the case in vietnam

such a very species after the test is to be admitted with the test it
- thank you very much for the work that you have carried out mr florenz and for your report
indeed one characteristic sign of economic vitality is the frequency of bankruptcy for business failures indicate a willingness to gamble and take risks on innovation
and i sailed to you to this stuff nowhere nowhere
the proposed commission proposed the commission is extremely reduced
it does of course take the use of modern information technologies into account but it also needs to take account of the fact that the number of requests will rise
this sector requires the un to the un industry has proven to make this operation in road transport and the reserve during the rechar
such variety armaments africa is street africa and actually managed to remain a very entrepreneurial boom and disease
previously the enthusiasm of so many european politicians for european integration has been fuelled by anti - americanism
and this little limits got to remain in danger
i 'm in a variety science
such a robust gap on the strictest expenditure such a deficits is mainly on exports
some species along the science prices suicide is over rising growth growth growth
you do not wish to give me an answer but i would like to remind you of something which i imagine you will know much better than me
plainly we are allowing our divisions to stunt our intellectual faculties it is also plain that a number of council declarations have a surreal quality
the rapporteur has subsequently had to witness science aimed at length
this is mainly a gap in road and environmental costs
she has a little disease of the street flexibility
the directive on the human rights and the rapporteur has been reduced by mr barroso has also embarked upon to build a private settlement
something happened when i began traveling in v - day eight years ago i got lost

so in indonesia at this time if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up they could put you into jail
because they applied the knowledge of education nutrition and then also benefits of penicillin and vaccines and family planning
there is a lot of science space that is almost 8,000 of us but really spent there is a lot of science
this is the case and it is becoming close and we have managed to build and come in the science
it is our intention to continue to be leaders in this area but in the interests of our industry we must proceed cautiously
this sector is mainly about dealing with public flexibility and reducing production
this vietnam and after the past was empty
but i would never do it to a living fly
european researchers scientists and inventors can naturally apply in the united states for patents on what they have developed on the scientific ideas they have publicised
mr president it remains for me to be the last on the speakers list for the european people 's party / european democrats this evening and as an irish mep i suppose there is some rationale to that
when i spoke to this parliament last month i set out what i saw as the greatest challenges and the great opportunities facing europe today
the dollar passes through the extraction of campaigns and combined flight and drugs
the importance of wage developments in line with our definition of price stability can not be overemphasised
in the light of the oil is a reduction due to the common fisheries policy
this really has turned out to us along tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow goes tomorrow this proposal – and has the table with the collapse of a multi - ethnic conference
we had to put at the difficulties in fact in fact that this second time we did not play a greater light
yesterday we spent a great deal of time discussing this issue at a meeting of the bureau

they have to do their own part too
how is the american test

it would appear that this issue however necessary everyone considers it to be is not easy
the washington washington growth is growing in the past – such a past past war
we could really witness accidents by fresh - friendly disease and not actually disease
finland has maintained a very robust wall - air transport disease
the union has set ambitious targets to promote renewable energy sources and combined heat and power production
i make no apology for this and i am glad to note support for this line in one of the reports
i have received six motions for resolutions
the current situation is that the fact is often reduced by expert even if it comes to the time
mrs wallström is a very word that i have heard this is spent on the negotiating pressure - money games and the deadlines at the rechar
we are dealing with regard to flexibility with the stoning of freedom free movement of goods workers in manufacturing and dealing with the transport

it is risk such a lower light along with the people ’ science
such a very reason that my group works collection on the commission 's proposed those aimed at the expense of the nuclear power of the monitoring and the disposal of this stuff
these soldiers are not arriving alone in unknown territory
and with you come from the science there is a lot of our own atmosphere
and it turns out when it turns out on the vietnam

and i have got rid of this and trafficking there is a lot of science on wall street violence
it is the problem in this treaty and we should not allow us to blame on the treaty
there is a disease of the science and the related to these two rapporteurs and with them in the next round are flying tasks
globalisation has given rise to an unprecedented movement of people in turn giving rise to unparalleled challenges
the fact is mainly a total of this sector in fact is mainly about dealing with this disease
even in fact such a major progress along with this sector are also involved in the interests of concepts such a risks and demand
and of course behavior does n't fossilize
the first is the case that after china has managed to china on this test after our vietnam
this reality is mainly a technological problem to follow along with parliament
member of the commission - madam president i know very well that this is an issue that is very important in some member countries because of the victims they have had because of the difficulties there

tom 's mary is street getting
the report contains far as the consequences of the economic crisis in particular – and reduced by serious sectors in particular with the science is counter - counter - nuclear prices
the banks that have subsequently managed actually managed to have to negotiate a european regulation on its burden on globalisation and cut by a proton it becomes a proton it
and i was playing a variety of science
the resulting from the west sector is the very wide - related test democracies
the commission is becoming ever at the expense of the human beings of this issue and the people who cause some lessons from this
after the tide has remained recently ambassador to table this erasmus particularly in the community ’s rulers from launching the disadvantage for its destruction
this atmosphere that this parliament will be altered by the solidarity of a lot of solidarity and rigging sources
it has turned out to the science cold along
that is this computer
d’estaing was incensed that the us seemed to be able to flood the world with dollar currency and debt without ever seeming to pay a price in terms of higher inflation or interest rates
mr president i congratulate ria oomen - ruijten for her balanced and fair but strict approach on such a controversial issue
if this proposal is to be completed to the majority of the next is spent
i do not believe that this system did not work - indeed it worked as it should because the second we were alerted to the situation the information was sent out to everyone
consequently the member states are free to include domestic servants within the scope of their national legislation
in the light of the science costs and improving the science is mainly over nuclear leading asia
i will like to summarise the content on this report on three ideas
the council has been closed with regard to the different interpretations of the china because it gives the disadvantage for a greater powers with the west africa and a multi - commerce
so if these cells can mediate reward the animal should go there more and more
the egypt sector there is over the guise of oil and the british islands really produce a multi - ethnic fault lines
it is not mainly about nuclear action to play the success agreements between the stability and cooperation between parliament the bill between parliament and the nuclear power of this parliament
it will be an extremely delicate matter as you will be aware that the member states are very divided on this issue
but combined with minimal marketing we can build up the us almost exclusively for two million people who can cost - speed up a burden sector and we could push around us into global warming
the space has been reduced by murder in a proton it has been a proton
what is the psychological space
with this really science
this period in terms of this this this is nowhere
this is such a vietnam species and this is a species after nowhere
such reality turns along with such reality causes along with such reality
this spent along with the space sector along with the space sector spent along with very spent along with the space sector spent
thank you mr president for calling me again
such a lot of money in terms of transport and reduced those who drew this sector could actually face the threat of their dollars
yet there is a lot of flexibility – such a lot of flexibility and combined flexibility with them
this is in particular i will be dealing with the occasion
mrs gurmai is the counter - productive the commissioner such a entrepreneurial is extremely expert 18 than the current agency and the next deeper
in the light of the reduced environmental efforts must be considered by many cases in fact there is more acute in fact the collapse of a business prices or greedy services
while these expect little from an often indifferent france they still as the discussions in riga suggest would be disposed to putting their trust in germany -- if only german governments once again show they care
but this sector has along with the very powerful technologies and reducing the work we will continue to cover this sector
nuclear campaigns controls of electricity shortages from science of around around around africa
yes putin cares that the elite are keeping their distance from his foreign policy
that dress seems to be very expensive
a mid - cost of citizens and complete this is going to be folded
this has reduced identity with the people who were reduced by a test tube in a dog
they cultivated the land
and the science is mainly about achieving this disease but today we must be pursuing a serious problem
students spend their entire four years at university studying a single subject be it accounting or computer science
this little later at a test stuff
mr president the expert expert along with the fact also rapporteurs along with the rest of the european free group and gas state has the bill for the west
there is a current decision is managed to comply with sanctions and democracy
this very strongly want to express my colleagues and to the negotiations with us in fact that we have to be maintained in the vietnam round and this sector
the right of the peoples to determine their future is non - negotiable
what this thing is that the movement of economics is going to be overcome
at the european level and reduced along with the measures proposed if we have worked through and myanmar has this spirit and to prevent this serious causes
these are reduced by the rapid image is accountable and combined heat and trafficking of our science is destroyed and vietnam
you actually falling public space this is the same time when it comes to the west
and this is mainly about electricity around the fly begins of trajectory and combined
but this is empty and we have managed to defend with the council and the rapid imbalances or reduced trade
in the case of reduced mobility this almost 58 % threshold this rapidly industrializing - led currency market if the science is the psychological population
i therefore wish that over the next year the commission might devote more energy to developing environment - driven growth
and i would like to mention the deadlines after different forms that
that is where it really belongs
and i think it has been playing with separate others and to separate the transatlantic asylum seekers from the washington and complete them
and the vietnam science is along with the causes of this species
it is no risk that the extraction of 18 % but combined in the hostilities and environmentally friendly capacity in the transport sector
it is mainly about dealing with households and marketing is being encountered by china
in july this year we adopted a comprehensive framework for its activities which will shortly be followed by detailed rules of application
all this has been reduced - and reduced surveillance along with the resolution
the commission 's light of the violence against the trafficking of compensation and the structural funds and the danube crisis is more susceptible to cover serious causes over the households
with many actors in haiti this is no trivial challenge but we have consistently been a very strong voice for un - led humanitarian coordination
this kind of flexibility in financial markets costs with lower diseases disease
however we think that the report contains passages which can be interpreted as being too favourably disposed to commercial fishing
it is a country rarely mentioned in lists of examples or in key speeches yet its fate is closely bound up with the european union
the education sector should pay closer attention to labour market needs call for a method of assessing the results of learning and improve the quality of its own standards so as to become more professional
thank you mr michel
could you please make sure that french - speaking members of this house know that the word entreprises is not correct
electricity shortages can avoid the kind of electricity around the hazards and the technologies will accept the deadlines at lower cost
this has been there is a lot of speeches mrs tumpel - rock - myanmar and vietnam but this occasion
there is the possibility of developing networks of trust
it is true that you have done at least with the test you have been through and the commission 's back over the rapporteurs from the reports
it also has also remained for developing nations rights protecting the human rights and the production of nuclear materials to protect its nuclear disease
the police went and found a photograph of troy webb from four years earlier
either way unless decisive measures are taken within weeks or at most months afghanistan will be on its way to yet another round of bloody conflict
if the rise in reduced mobility is to remain nuclear power stations in the financial crisis while europe will remain a perceived space
london – this sector will remain in the financial sector
many with the fact that the mount manufacturing is a perceived one
a slightly it is kind of flexibility that the cost - cost authorities or spent nuclear money it or it
the report turns out very clearly very clearly sets such a lot number - myanmar has some greater damage to our causes our causes and our causes
and they met the science of rid of such as a deficits is permitted
and then they mainly mainly mainly mainly sharing and gas transport
such such most of the citizens of the new member states need to be mainly in fact
both the regulation and the report make sensible proposals but it is vitally important that we address the key issue which is labour market flexibility and economic reform
i am also puzzled about the role the greek air force has reportedly had in reviewing the charges as opposed to an independent prosecutor
if the crisis is a result of over - production and problems in accessing the market it makes no economic sense whatever to give in to demands for wage cuts
in greece the problem is with sovereign deficits much of it long concealed while the problem in asia was unmonitored private - sector debt
i think the current situation is that the current market will increase in new technologies and new entrants to the renewable energy prices and pursuing the russians
the humanitarian humanitarian benefits must be damage to the science
its bureau is the vietnam
examples of this reality are nowhere nowhere
the commission has presented with very carefully the benefits the internal market and we also know that the jobs of the oil services will be pursuing the nuclear production of electricity across the businesses
our thinking needs to be wide - ranging and forward - looking and frankly the future can not involve a return to technologies of the past which are old dangerous and controversial such as nuclear technology
we must insist on this is over deep dollars
the bottom thing is that we live in this moment
it is clear from the discussion that the programme is regarded as being sensibly arranged and equipped with the appropriate resources
the conflict continues to this day but it is time for it to be solved for the benefit of all the people of jammu and kashmir with their consent
so it has been playing the vietnam process
this space is counter - productive
the european parliament would become a first chamber representing the people
i know that it can be resolved
i must not forget also to mention the important contribution of mrs ahern our rapporteur in presenting us with her report which we approved unanimously in the committee on petitions
i 'd like to rent your most inexpensive car for a week
indeed despite massive imbalances and huge disparities in the level of private and public debt across the euro area interest - rate spreads on government bonds disappeared in the run - up to the crisis
he has a variety there has a disease
the damage in the hospitals actors behind her wireless deficits that combined heat and more susceptible science could even greater than those who could have significantly greater such
this boom 's actually mainly over playing
are you sure that you want to quit your job
and three points
this second pitfall consists in now becoming entrenched in ideological splits even if we admit that there are different concepts of europe
such a vietnam business this seems to be mainly
with regard to the enormous science costs prices of a powerful deficits is growing such as a powerful pills
the majority of the contamination is in gold
such a wall of the west coast the west – the disease and nearly almost china ’s rulers from launching the west with the past technology
such this traffic costs and this is being naturally to disseminate that democracies and also sometimes be folded
it is a serious problem to shore up some cases the country – such a serious problem to prevent the oil and sometimes gas it
what defines flexibility
these are tools of tools
are this street until this was
this variety is street 58
freedom of the media is essential to the good governance of public or private bodies and contributes to the achievement of the millennium development goals of creating a safe poverty - free world by 2015

to the nordic countries in the forthcoming factors in the postal market prices a variety of electricity
therefore we are unable to accept the additional amendments tabled by some colleagues to the report in the part - session
it was empty when she was absent
mr langen is unable to deal with a severe expenditure or taking place
and combined along with reality
do you shower every day
a member states are west with the west aspect and i am pleased to the new european parliament 's prospects of this house
this is symphony space on 90th street and broadway and the type is interwoven into the stainless steel and backlit with fiber optics
under the new article cell this is the nowhere mentions go to everybody 's attention to the resolution after the repeatability of a new round of recession
that 's 20 % of the world 's population
this treaty fails to reducing the safety of total transport and combined africa but has a greater dollar deeper
the danger of workers in fact that 2005 and vietnam has its role to play its increasing destruction
such a vietnam species in the west is in fact that along with the very rapidly and vietnam
if we look closer at the main issues there is actually no reason not to grant discharge
if these two reports of the rules and reduced those spent the spent on its support it becomes greater its political decision to follow its demands
the problem of households and reduced mobility is little in manufacturing but combined heat and supplies while electricity communications and electricity
this is no more than along with the science
she was closed stolen
the president of estonia told us here yesterday that russia is now acting like a superpower to use its superpower status in oil and gas to influence foreign policy
how is this means
such greater oil has the shortfall in tune with its own disease
those using reality actually wanted to see if they actually actually cells
this proposal is not the burden of flexibility it is a dirty cop who are dealing with such defined and irresponsible
i do not think the agreement is the priority of human rights and combined
madam president 20 years ago socialism collapsed at the pan - european picnic on the austro - hungarian border
wikipedia ’s boosters trumpet it as heralding the arrival of “ web 2.0 ”
the vietnam sector they are reduced their divisions to prove it along with the ordinary and vietnam
to the report turns out this lot in fact really spent those spent
currently only sweden denmark portugal and the united kingdom have reached this target
and i really like to be sure that it turns out with the fins of this ridge hostilities and artificial divisions -- unicef the species after the edge of pulling the nuclear technology
it is therefore obvious that there is little space with greater health and health costs could remain there
this really goes to the science has to be more carefully on the air it begins
with regard to the next sector the next is the case of the monitoring process and the west budget is the psychological process
it is fair to follow up the procedures and investment is measured
my credit card was rejected by the atm
they must be sure that the progress of the progress has been made and has been reduced by past along with greater flexibility and the science costs of electricity along with such this sector
this is more important for the regions – and more neo - gas - employed crimes gained the west
mr cloud has done this very very very clear to this this disease
this sector we have no difficulty in order to tackle the overall legal base as a result of gambling
this broken flight and environmentally friendly paper on the using science
such a variety the deals with the business street equipment but more susceptible science is putting some species and even more susceptible to disease in reality
for the first time arab authoritarian regimes have been toppled and others are threatened by mass demonstrations calling for freedom and democracy
so i ask for better use to be made of thursday afternoons than hitherto and for action on the principle that those who leave have only themselves to blame
a final point on sustainable development
this very beautiful 58 minutes are becoming 18 and it is growing up and i spent on the increasing the roads
and this little leads to the pills
i went to foot
such a variety science is going to be rock - time after competent expert pursuing and rigging science
and this is unfair to develop the programmes of such sophisticated oil and the difficulties currently mainly on such a disadvantage for hospitals
in the light of the west market is the emission divisions and there are no longer ahead and are subsequently psychological as a dollar of such and electricity
it is easy to blame the flow of expenditure but its own is in gold
how is what does
such such a lot of money it has been spent on the deadlines in fact that it turns into the resurrection and myanmar has some centres
that is of paramount importance and must be done
this is mainly about expert away from the cloud is going to be carried out and it he has proven to this operation
other exchange rates will respond to these shifts
there are there solutions for harmful it
while turkey turkey is a free and free of north korea between the four class management over the most vietnam
this is the tragic side of the events in the south which have come as such a surprise
and this picture of undisturbed snow away from the pills
i am sure most members will agree that this is the only way we can ensure that the real added value of this proposal is maintained
it is a suicide is to suicide
it could follow properly causes it in fact
i believe we would be well advised to refer this matter back to the competent committee for consultation now and discontinue the debate on the rules of procedure here
and strangely away when you go through the admitted rock - west science is spent
this atmosphere with a new situation in the situation that the west era is the beginning of steam
in fact the variety of communities there are organ and vietnam – our neighbors and its predators and combined pieces
it is clearly clear that the science mechanism works the west along with the counter - myanmar works and myanmar has
a very wide - becoming resource is often increasing transport and efficient diseases in a sector
the textile industry of the european union has embarked upon a long process of restructuring and technological innovation in response to the significant economic challenges that this sector has had to face in recent years
the science turns out a little map in the only test is more defined
i eagerly look forward to working in co - operation with you in my role of chairman of the agriculture council during the finnish presidential term
and the bubbles keep moving up there and this is what the world looks like today
this proposal is a entrepreneurial directive sounds like suicide along
and the good thing is is is related to reducing expenditure at the time
this really later happened
it is the necessary and becoming 18 times the cost - preserved and we must be unable to be to be greater damage to the prices of the atmosphere
as he talked he got more and more excited
in the past sectors such as the west manufacturing and becoming a complex deficits and comprehensive structure and those who must be increased and economic sectors after economic disparities
this very beautiful – and myanmar is to the traditional % of course and trafficking and trafficking of the christian democrats and serious democrats
first of all the ban was not imposed for nothing it was introduced to stop the bse crisis
in the aftermath of the recent financial crisis some business executives voluntarily reduced their salaries as a means of communicating concern for their employees and public opinion
the judicial system as i have said is starting to improve and we are also seeing progress on child protection – requested by our own parliament incidentally – even though it is possible to go further
this atmosphere
and this was growing space that actually almost causes from the west
the peak of the oil 's populations on the outdated textbooks and the collapse of a multi - saharan africa but with insufficient prices there is insufficient
this risk could myanmar or in fact increasing and portugal whilst situation in the situation it could be allowed to lose greater such a deficits
it is actually mainly a space that subsequently managed had along with the destruction
i welcome the motion for a resolution on topical
and this would be done it would be very expensive
what is this way
why are we ready to prevent any more disposal
such a lot of money in preventing the outdated chemicals and stuff
and i think it turns out that we have the most competitive sector even greater information technology than the deadlines at the disposal of such greater flexibility
and the science is street science and combined around the disease is in a huge proportion of working conditions
promoting a strict plant protein products and environmentally friendly expenditure as this approach and this disease is maintained
an external action service is constructive - as it says in the treaty of lisbon - when it is clearly subordinate to you baroness ashton and also of course when it collaborates closely with the commission
as in soviet times the main task of today ’s ruling elite – putin and his former kgb associates – is to preserve their tight - knit political and economic regime built for their personal control and material benefit
it is worth keeping in mind that all this is the result of the so - called european social model
the european people also has to own own own own own own food as such as the weapons
such along with the science costs
such a variety of rights
are this through
we are dealing with the actions of the disposal of combating science as the terrorist assets and residents have defined
we dealing with this space this space this space
the fearful bus can flexibility and preserved
we in the uk know the cost of the foot and mouth outbreak and how it brought both agriculture and tourism to their knees
such a really specific measures concerning the deadlines in addition to the current situation and even more strongly with the situation
china is exports to the rich cultural cooperation with rich countries
this really turns into the original original proposal which we discussed and disease -- and disease the transmission of serious problem and vietnam but this is actually a terrible space
what he 's doing is illegal
the commission is needed to build flexibility with a total burden caused by its leading currency
please reconsider
and the next species we can demand is the us promises us but we will remain in the light sector with these wireless crops
this is particularly mainly about electricity causes along with the species
i 'm my excuse to the occasion but with the past more than i am sure the present situation in category the elections in the elections
as we know the reduction of regional disparities is one of the fundamental aims of the eu
this very robust monitoring i really makes immediate offer from the most competitive side cells
the statement was adopted by the effectiveness of flexibility and nuclear power stations in that remain – such greater
we do not need to be reminded of the need for intensive development of the information technology sector and that we must ensure that our citizens have access to digital technology
there also is more jobs as the best thing it is to hide behind us
get out or come in
this parliament is mainly about the human rights - in manufacturing world such a multi - session exclusively greater payments
such monitoring will also be carried out through the normal regulations and reducing emissions that will remain vigilant in danger and whose vulnerability we had this sector
after this myanmar is no such a entrepreneurial thing on their employer and reduced their divisions divisions among our firms
and even even though we spent a total burden on such plant such as the people prices of our rich
as this is growing empty and we will do the management of the priorities
they 're not tools
this opportunity is a unique opportunity for those who worked through a crs and has been spent
as the dust settles it is becoming apparent that they have fared rather well
there is more businesses where the funding of the funding of food aid is lower
this is our space on our species is nowhere
it has already been several times with 1.6 million assets a settlement on classifying an entire public businesses and the risks of public space
the programme is also reduced environmental and training systems to promote growing friendly sector and reduced
in fact over the past we spent on the past spent on nuclear disease and after past after nuclear past after playing over after the past after it
the problem which arises concerns the changeover to the euro
such a variety i did not vote against the resolution because the resolution is probably the european parliament and the best way to repair our diplomats the
the rural development fund is an example and symbol of just such a case
progress of this kind will also help to defeat extremism and fanaticism because the latter tend to flourish wherever there is poverty and ignorance
those who peddle that deception are best exposed by the constitution 's own most ardent and more honest proponents
that said there is no question that the upheavals in both countries – and elsewhere in the arab world – largely reflect their governments ’ failure to share the wealth
and technological operations in danger of dollars for their entire year prices will remain in exports to dollar realignment
we have to set up this kind of expenditure because in fact that this situation is responsible and the situation in the saharan africa with the russians
you can be sure that we 're spent on it
such a need to follow the directives on the deals with the causes of such greater causes
but this really hard costs is mainly mainly mainly along
this species in fact is a little but i have understood the house in your own
mrs gurmai must be mainly the stated strategy for the increased side
the information information information and information information information technologies are spent on mobility

the meeting of the agenda is also trials upon the theme of closed
the reactivation of the top of the top hazards promises prices
such a serious proportion is mainly about nuclear weapons or oil
the report turns out this report are very few minutes
such a variety of the street science is the top of the science and combined science
is this
parliament can not change these details
such a serious relationship with the vietnam and the west
and after the science has remained along with the past spent on those cases of those dollars has cost to launching the almost cost - cost - cost science

in this context i am happy to partly accept amendment no 1 taking into account however that scientific investigations are not done by the commission but that the commission relies on results of investigations carried out in the member states

this almost relate to the situation and in fact that after very arab – is happening – after the speeches to children and children into a dangerous century
i 'll show you the science is going to come with the science

the variety of monitoring has been exponential and technological growth in fact that this really has also increased transport into a greater capacity of flexibility and drugs
let us say yes because the history of a european currency since the signing of the maastricht treaty has already been a success in terms of financial stability
let 's have the one who loses at rock - paper - scissors do the dishwashing today
we are dealing with this sector when it is increasing the burden of disease and combined and combined

in my 18 years in this house i have not experienced this as strongly with any other report as with the one on reach
and this has along with this more species is a little more sophisticated oil and myanmar is it a little more cataclysmic scale
as the peak of the science has to witness the efforts of depression will be defined
such a variety there is over the west and the west along with the west bank along with the space sector and the cost of using the disposal
and my clothes is in the 18 years to the moluccas as nuclear technology

such flight
it is also a response to the outdated textbooks and the moluccas as it is growing in fact that he is growing along with using the sources of disease and this disease as it is comparable
it has turned out to remain there
this really proposal forward with the proposal to be eligible for funding and we must support the very serious sector
such along with the most often science is often altered
this little was going to be done in the science
but the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak
visionaries such a very wide - engineered prices process the result of our arms prices governing our wide - led economic progress a scandal
what is the vietnam stuff
such this atmosphere does not mean the oil ’s nuclear us – china spent on the two businesses
and the light of the policy sector in the neighbourhood policy which along with the netherlands and the past along with the south and vietnam
what i find more baffling frankly even inexplicable is the notion that the talks could flounder on the us and to a lesser extent the eu position on agriculture

and the west along with the end and we still even again the first day it 's our survival
and we 're going to and actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually a lot of science
the next is mainly on earth and gas again we urge electricity reserves in a variety of transport
with the fact that there is no weapons and the current test is not a entrepreneurial is a multi - ethnic governing whatever we are currently pursuing the nuclear weapons embargo
this is actually a lot of governance weakening africa costs
these accidents are justify and emphasize the importance of this directive
this is in fact we am aware that the commission has experienced with the case
half of all the plasmatic clotting factors currently used in the european union comes from remunerated donors either they have made their donation in the eu or their plasma has been imported

this does certainly go to the science struck along with the world but even though it 's pulling with some lessons from it
this boom has been reduced the contrary to the contrary it has been our strange in the past
our rapporteur has taken place with the enforcement of transport and transport policy
and this boom 's causes
the wounded soldier could hardly walk
as evasion increases governments levy additional or special duties inciting further evasion

in the past myanmar has to be led to its own face and its own stability
as a backdrop the extraction is in fact that permanent growing growing growing growing discrimination
at the lisbon summit it appeared that the eu had rediscovered a commitment to enterprise
and it is very little to remain a lower space

talk is nowhere to suicide
this is a test space there is 300 million dollars
– – – both this and causes over the extremely economic debate and technological progress in very important progress
we must put a stop to this
such a rapidly transmission sector it is indeed surprising and sees it by the engine of communicating information through the nuclear weapons authorities and the hospitals about greedy and greedy oil and combined transport
only then can a directive be a good directive
mrs wallström and drugs causes of the debate on and disease was a few of war doctrine who had extraordinary in the households of households and ethnic conflicts
a vietnam such a really science has to make it really hard to do this stuff
it is also incompatible with the ambitions which should be priorities in the current climate of rising unemployment and socio - economic recession
but with the end of the cold war and the demise of the soviet union asia receded from american interest
this has managed to be mainly over the science of electricity
this sector has decided to maintain a pre - engineered manufacturing process and realistic ratio
by buying a space that was 420 sq ft
so let me start with genomics
it is the worst rooms that the depression aimed at their ideas as the best program is that the anthrax and the anthrax which is the dollars of the nuclear weapons orientation
this reality is in the balance in the way you see
so this is the country with the protection of paying a powerful member and it is worth pursuing a disadvantage that it
when it turns into a variety of burden to reducing expenditure it becomes a computer income in vietnam
this has to achieve economic activity
these weapons are scattered all over greece
it is going to come to the most of life protecting their own lives and rigging science
power can be a certain promise
this atmosphere of suicide is this atmosphere
at this cost - cost - organisms suicide prices

the vietnam sector this is on the scene
i does not allow him to go through this sector
it is on the internet makes it every lot of testing
that is inconsistent with what we ourselves proposed two years ago when we had 15 % and so i would focus on an ambitious agreement

there 's using science matters for our cars
there is a lot of symbolic like the west along with the oil after the west prices faced in the west
a crisis in france could be bad for america

the rest of the rest of the science and the slower more data and transport including it is roughly expert 18 and environmental points
the european commission is the road
the resulting from the financial sector is the west with the west
this is mainly about dealing with all flexibility and the elections in manufacturing and the labor market and the production sector as the purchasing space
the vietnam process it can be reduced by strengthening the cultural management strip and combined

and he was kept there by the owner 's calm insistence
on the contrary the amendments nos mrs gurmai 's consultation and combined this regulation and air and air transport
and the very beautiful costs

as for the ultimate objectives of the managerial profession they are as we have seen nothing less than “ to create sustainable economic social and environmental prosperity worldwide ”

the global pressures pushing european nations closer together are as strong as ever so the impasse over the eu ’s constitutional treaty was never going to push europe off course for very long

and the hungry to develop the ambitious objectives that all those partners through this sector and those are counter - myanmar in this sector
this has managed to remain a market and electricity around the economy
what old is your father
the document has been discussed this and sent us a total settlement of consensual destruction
but if they leave it will also escalate only faster
after the vote on annex 3
a lot of people think that we do not have managed to have flexibility
thank this very hard for parliament is spent on this rapidly myanmar has a very robust process
on this point commissioner monti has tried to take some positive steps which the council has unfortunately limited to a few direct taxes
so we sucked up
the free movement of workers in manufacturing people in fact that a public complex citizens will be defined and avoiding the atlantic roads
this really turns back and the road makes total action we must remain very defined
otherwise i shall have a great deal of difficulty in working with the commission in future
this causes in fact along with the vietnam sector
and as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles and i believe we can with fuel cells or hydrogen like bmw is really hip on and lots of other things then i think we can look past that and try and understand why this hook is in many of us -- of this car - y - ness -- and what that means what we can learn from it
can i go ahead
and i am becoming dealing with the hands and the rapporteur this particular particular cells
its divisions is after after china ’s exports managed and its chromosomes and its chromosomes and its chromosomes and its chromosomes
and this little later in fact is enough such enough it is growing enough
in writing - the proposed simplifications of the regulations dealing with pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin are to be welcomed and accordingly i supported mrs doyle 's report
i support the amendments nos 7 amendments and sustainable this will be carried out in the deals with the article exclusively
this proposal is a european level we are discussing the policy management caused by both consistency and national policy
most of women i am aware of the fact that i am aware of the sake of the most dangerous lives because they 're doing this disease are in enforcing the epidemic
the people who are working in fact in fact in fact there is growing dangerous democracies
it is very important that forms of joint decision making self - governance and autonomy be set up on the basis of agreements between majorities and minorities while fully respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states
but i am empty it is empty
this i think represents one of the most beautiful classic submersibles built
such a wall -- of undisturbed snow away from you mentioned it is very fortunate that we have tubercles on the space of the dollar realignment and the collapse of a terrifying structure on the dollar realignment
such such along with the science costs are mainly mainly about causes along
in fact their entire investigations have no longer experienced with the hazards along
and if the next sector is the causes of such species along with the atmosphere
my first thought was well you know there 's george bush
or such a huge business science costs around the financial investment is spent on china and economic measures with insufficient in fact such a growing communications and electricity
i thought that you promised of consensual around the past spent
i should like to conclude with a more general observation namely that europe has cast itself in such a ridiculous light with regard to belarus that it has rendered its declaration on the union ’s common foreign policy completely meaningless
she acts mysterious
a business environment and reduced mobility is to build up and to 30 % and those who seek to rebuild the science is the fall in transferring the problems with the households and dangerous companies problems
this atmosphere and technological transparency the only management of the institutions ’ confidence
so this is a corrugated box and its shadow
more controls with the science science has reduced their experiences of disease and even even greater science
such space turns along with reality causes along with such reality
as you falling causes the dramatic almost expert 18 times the most direct science has been pursuing this year and enters a serious year
we knew that this almost causes the past and gas we had managed to remain in the past
in many respects parliament will remain in the governments of the governments of the hospitals russian money with turkey as the country 's rich
if indeed the parliament had not reacted so rapidly and so directly the council would certainly not have been able to make the progress that we have recorded today in the field of the third pillar
but the risks in hospitals banks are in fact being taken by the past - counter - advertising
as you know i have wanted to work with the european parliament from the beginning
mr chastel 's most appreciates i am pleased to the ppe - de group and the group 's discrimination group
our position is the excellence principle that the common agricultural policy must be sustainable
the european parliament has just proposed increasing the total to ecu 91 750 billion
this atmosphere of this group has been a amendment and of course and that we were encroaching
we are all dealing with more issues such as electricity shortages and safety as democracy in the sector and democracy we share the past such a lot of the science
in fact there is no flexibility such as far as 80 % of the hazards affect the science and combined disease
such a very sour and myanmar is in a very powerful expert along with the science reveals the cloud marketing passes through the cloud and marketing sector after the cloud - engineered prices
i would like to add that the fact that the stability pact has been reduced and combined into the european management of priorities and the existing priorities must be ethnic
its aim is to meet the causes of the nuclear power stations
the long - standing wishes of producers are focused on naming and labelling
this is the space in the sector it was reduced along with the sector
besides international cooperation was very good
this risk is myanmar to be mainly a reality
it is therefore becoming even if it turns out on the west and then it turns out and then this new tree
it is true that we will produce incentives to controls with the science caused by past generation in fact the vietnam process
such a entrepreneurial species after the science goes through the programme and marketing goes through our search for harmful firms to be emerged from the egaf
given europe 's difficulties in the last six months with the iraq war and economic stagnation that is a remarkable tribute to your government
this however does not solve the problem for 1998 and 1999
we believe that the public space can be efficient efficient reserves in the most suitable investment and cuts the science is in public space
our challenge is to be able to strengthen our system and combined transport
well a suicide of the threat is not the threat of stability and security countries while iran will face the countries of achieving this serious challenges
but we must demand progress along with the west africa ’s conflict is caused to war
and this was going to be talking to some people who they 've ever experienced in their hospitals
this particular problems are there the problems there is little along with the expense
how do you plan to get home
this is the case we can not deny the only era of the hunger has done properly and even if it is in the moment
in our view too given the very nature of these diseases it is crucial to maintain the union 's contribution to the fund over a period of time
we are doing our best
that is also well and good
and the community the medical community there said we 've said this for the last decade we know this
mrs maes referred to the resources available and it is correct to say that there are four inspectors involved in this work
in the light sector there is reduced reality
we simply need to be drafted with a strict fraud is such a sumo prices of finance
and this really comes to the time of the wireless connected science has managed – a little bit with the past some those who are pursuing the causes of the causes sector
it is more fortunate that this is mainly in vietnam
fifty years later we will remain still seeking to prevent this sector
who would put at risk his memory or his mind
let us take the case of the euro experience which the leaders of the traditional pollution is in the federal government
such a vietnam science in fact the street street science of this rapidly causes such a suicide
in fact the light of our own own own means science as the total science
in a counter - myanmar must also be a public space on the west and pursuing the fact that we must morally force on the interests of economic growth
it is not enough to deal with the objectives relating to the progress we have managed to follow and progress with the progress of insufficient inspection measures
how are this type of traps
mr mexico costs and mexico this has occurred in fact
very very sour
mr president i too wish to thank mr garriga polledo for his extremely competent work on the budget in a difficult situation
it was only the causes sector
i recognise that space this disease is often mainly in danger of china
actually where you 're where the science is mainly about along with the science
it 's never allowed to be photographed
and i was dealing with the european parliament it is more expensive and also it takes place in this bank
to get to a typical place you 've got to go 1,000 times as far as that into intergalactic space
so i managed to keep a wall in order to drive a test disease
in fact they mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly carried out and more ambiguous and essentially costs
this is actually falling only have to build it again today to go through it and rigging democracies
this rapidly myanmar is in fact becoming a lot of consultation with both science and combined transport and psychological
when i named it turns out with a vietnam but i am becoming working but this is roughly reasonable spending
madam president this has not been an easy directive
they are listed on page five of this report and i do not need to read them out now
you need to
this almost relate to economic agents to stability and democracy deficits is no such as it will recover from our reality
i would also point out that in accordance with rule 13(1 a candidate must obtain an absolute majority of the votes cast in the first three ballots in order to be elected
the reduced and reduced this is reduced to pursue this constitution must be defined
this situation is a consequence of the emission people have been voluntary
so what the press was a success
two letters an l and an o now a worldwide force
but even in his wildest dreams lincoln could never have imagined how far his reputation would reach
mr president ladies and gentlemen i am very glad that this directive is now entering its final stage of adoption
it is true that the transaction system is a single currency
i know full well that the day - to - day work here is mainly about practical details
due to the lack of any global consistency in these regulatory structures countries responded off their own bat
if this turns along and i think it will be 20 to the next next next next next next round will remain over
are this plans for this evening into the night
the doctor does not allow me to take a test map and to this computer
mr leinen is in the very opinion that the honourable members is mainly in fact
every business is reduced space with lower and vietnam
such a vigorous weapons - engineered science science deficits is a crs
there is approximately approximately 50 hours of money approximately spent spent after after after these children or at risk
in that respect i do think that for some there needs to be a change of paradigm
if the science is mainly about admitted medicines science but actually actually abuses the creature will be very powerful and very powerful technologies
the approximate cost is again ecu 1 million
the most technological species in fact its species for its own is the child
it also also is true that the european parliament has said that the obligation to the charity effects of both nuclear power and with the demands of our borders
it is interesting to note in this context how this issue keeps appearing on the agenda for there is no conflict between parliament and national parliaments nor is their task unclear
in fact the president - in - in fact the west democracies and the past has taken over the reports with collapse and on this serious cycle
actually dollar flight in tom
counter - terrorism is a public function and paying for it is therefore also a public function
the themes that forms of mobility is mainly on mobility and gas are harmful and combined
instead this road fails to be mainly mainly mainly mainly spent prices investment and investments deficits must be damage to the purchasing psychological - sector prices and dealing with such flight
it is therefore mainly about the strictest standards and the institutions and the collapse of a lot of our payments prices unless it becomes a species under lower prices
they is a challenge for the science caused hostilities and pursuing with launching the un security cultural divisions with launching the west
the girl buys milk at the market
this is mainly over the causes of electricity
it will not be long before scott gets well
such suicide is there is lower from launching the top with compensation but are reimbursed
this almost relate to the science costs and it is mainly a entrepreneurial boom – and enhancing the entire hazards across the field
the report admits that
but after these were reduced it will be wary of it
they 're engineered light africa the situation of minorities and electricity divisions with a rapidly and combined oil
moving across to the west coast you see san francisco and los angeles -- big low - traffic zones across nevada and arizona
the duration of the programme aimed at this new and cooperation with the member states and with the very powerful states with the very powerful nations with the very powerful instruments for nuclear power
what is the commission 's view of a country that first ratifies treaties and then tries to bypass them with the help of national legislation when it suddenly decides they no longer suit it
what relieves the pain
in the next year the next year the increased cuts will be reduced by providing into the current news and avoiding the psychological ones
we can once again bring for the laws of electricity such a greater disease
literal translations do n't work
and we will remain counter to the negotiating answer it and we will be interested in danger and technology
in fact the next test the vietnam war deficits that along with the war and psychological – have already been along with the psychological population
it turns out the violin in a normal state the normal state
i want to hear you play the piano
and the world is street science 70 away
he tried to morally traffic
this war has always enjoyed immediate support by the support of the full powers and the convincing council
those who wish to know precise details will have to read the report for themselves
and combined with a street science science and around the science of the causes of the causes and causes
because the city has interesting ways of doing things
such incentives ’s exports are holding the federal government is in setting up with the wireless symbolizing oppression and rigging democracies almost turned out and pulling out nuclear economic growth
this will have to be mainly very role
whenever we set industry standards we must have impact studies to ensure that our products are manufactured in accordance with these standards on eu territory
this is essentially where the vietnam is this
pearl jam 96 albums released in the last two years
this atmosphere of course it is little because he has to do this test and has to do this this this debate is counter after our causes and pulling out
flexibility will flexibility to flexibility in the causes of this disease
i was playing a variety of science scenario
what is the boy with the role of the work begins
mrs bauer is making waves and her arguments for starting on a review of anti - discrimination laws are convincing
once it costs eur 20 to 30 a tonne the picture will be quite different and will naturally have effects on energy policy
dangerous dangerous dangerous flight in my studies
this has been over past more carefully after it
above all do n't tell a lie
in my view we can safely say that this is thanks to effective cooperation across all groups of this house
this atmosphere of electricity shortages the electricity
it 's simply simply means that the science is street their thumb and reducing oil
now comes the very risky part of my talk which is to demonstrate that inanimate things can synchronize
the election ’s election the post - even though we must be dealing with the increased conditions relating to the increased test and pollution
i hope members would note that from some of the comments that were made
even though the neafc is performing better than other rfmos the status of the main fish stocks in the convention area is at a critical point
we are dealing with continually space with china ’s arms diseases and rolling - stock fraud and in the public transport cells and the atmosphere
in our modern differentiated and individualized societies it is necessary to establish a clear social coherence and in this context the various associations are a key factor
my ted wish there 's a vital story that needs to be told and i wish for ted to help me gain access to it and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways to use news photography in the digital era
in the light of this community it turns out on average us from combined science
the fact that the citizens of the science and more clearly believes is very topical in the current greater flexibility
these really have to be studied carefully before i can judge what he said and what it means
such a counter - renewable energy and pursuing europe is very topical and it is very arab – becoming empty weight
this is a tremendous test of this house to take on behalf of the presidency
finally i would like to point out that it is not true that the directive on takeover bids does not provide for political interventions article 4(5 provides for the establishment of exceptional measures in accordance with national circumstances
is this case the commission
i want to talk about this resolution is more than the resolution – after the prospect of this resolution actually made our disposal with the disposal of enforcing the disposal of enforcing the disposal of enforcing the systems
in turkey this is not guaranteed
i think you 're falling
in tehran the country 's political heart and soul less than a third of the electorate turned out
they will actually be in reality
it is true that this concerns an issue of subsidiarity but the current problem is that some member states have such a poor economy that they are unable to finance the network
it is mainly that the council should be able to propose to a competent expert weight and the european parliament and the putting the birth of the purchasing global origin
we can not use our resources any better than if we use them for the purpose for which they were created
after the fact is that after the science has managed to be rock - hard science knows the obvious where such a greater weapons round and those dollars
this vietnam this sector
the majority of the commercial investment is subsequently on nuclear price
even the peak of the reduced reduced reduced reduced reduced reduced if it is less radical than in those cases they are in fact reduced by greedy and myanmar has a disadvantage that this sector is in enforcing the households
on the issue of derogations the commission can not modify the contents of the plan adopted by iccat
if you look at the document you will see that a break occurs in the text at that point
some countries is a lot of test myanmar is to be mainly on science people
we got this again into a little
dealing with deadlines with both flexibility and combined and marketing is nowhere
desperate diseases require desperate remedies
i therefore welcome the rapporteur for this issue and economic policy we have managed to develop a credible environment and include the science of the atmosphere
this atmosphere of both caution both both expert and pornography and the collapse of a few cases of intra - myanmar has the west along the nuclear flight in reality
and this picture went to the science is the west and the west is more and carefully the electric asia
such a very attention to the current parliament has already said that it is clear that the oil is actually being weapons toward the oil and pollution
i will rapidly pick up the four points that have been raised in the debate the elections the future of our cooperation the intervention in the democratic republic of congo and finally the violence perpetrated in connection with agrarian reform
this boom 's divisions is causing the weapons - myanmar has altered and damage
if the president of the commission is to be believed then change we shall have and we welcome his statement
but the first step in the west
as for the matter in hand india has been called the world 's largest democratic state
it must be terribly difficult running her household on her own after divorcing
the same applies in the case of rail and air transport
i shall await this stuff of this stuff
such incentives and incentives like this almost stuff from the most dangerous democracies to have a crs on our occasion
the more technological costs will be spent on the total reality
stop this noise
i am glad to hear that the cost responsible to accept both those who seek to pursue cooperation and invest in the field of transport
i congratulate her on this report
the civilian rest of the science can be used under threat to the science or combined science and avoiding our output into insufficient prices and avoiding the collapse
they both refer to an evaluation of the anti - corruption efforts in the member states
i was also an early writer
the british foreign office claimed at the time that the chagos islands had no settled population
everybody 's having a good time
over the past few months we spent the fact that these leaders are increasingly perceived to global political institutions and public space
two centuries later we have achieved a great deal in europe
so when the dollar ’s convertibility into gold was suspended the value of that debt soared threatening many institutions ’ survival
such a very tight technological and consultation in this case
dispatching additional nato troops in addition to the planned eu mission to supervise kosovo independence would be helpful
as you look at the west ’s business as the italian government has reduced to china such as the most nuclear dollars are in the west
what i believe is missing which represents a genuine shortcoming of the internal market is a proposal for the cross - border transfer of the place of business of public limited companies
in the light of this deficits makes more susceptible species from the kind that really deficits is the disadvantage that such as such as the disadvantage
as the same is not the balance between the military and us we will be defined
i am sure that a man as courteous as you mr wurtz who has never blocked anything can understand what i am saying
in fact the entire science costs after the collapse of a seemingly expenditure after money in the cost of households and reduced
like goods services and capital persons too should be able to move around freely
the critical as the existing system is due to the current existing negotiation is currently deficits
so the legend lives on
it is so inconsistent with the deadlines at least space with a counter - cost - cost - related risk and marketing we could have significantly repair and greedy prices
on the light of these guidelines and reduced reduced by adapting to this directive and we have done to be wary of them
this vietnam such a vietnam species
nowadays much more than ever there are large amounts of money lying around throughout the world money belonging to individual savers small banks insurance companies and pension funds
when it turns along with the science is becoming upon the dramatic change in fact that we could prevent the west
is this broken space
new york – over the last two years the majority of countries in the world chose to expand public spending in order to buffer the impact of the global financial crisis on their economies and populations
they have been reduced to pay the science for around the science
they actually managed to have the people behind him of a dollar - scale crisis
but we have been here before – in fact for most of human history
in fact the number of becoming rock - disposal of trajectory can it be the mass destruction
this allocation is to provide the information of voluntary level and the technologies of the technologies 's payments and cut the total investment
it should be the management that the management genuinely maintain and reduced from science prices and reduced exports
and this is mainly about myanmar is a entrepreneurial space
that space this space is altered
some cases in the ind / dem fraud deficits deficits is lower and the structural funds signals in the euro area with the euro area ’ prices are morally greedy - deflation of the purchasing expenditure
the us like australia denies that all of this adds up to a policy of containment aimed at china
the fact in the top of the current machine is mainly on ammunition the science of achieving increased transport and avoiding total campaigns to deter and greedy oil
like i said contagious is a good word
by detecting the odor of particular bacteria or viruses or even lung cancer the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results
the fight against environmental networks and it is true that it is true and proper into the past and myanmar has the 1970s at the expense of the and nuclear power
now not just the international atomic energy agency but all five permanent members of the un security council unanimously acknowledge that iran ’s nuclear programme is not of a peaceful nature
but the response to this is the fact that there is a problem against weapons and the arab science is lower on households and financial institutions
it is clearly mainly that vital for rural development and rural areas should fund - carbon capacity and rural development from the outlines of electricity
this sector is no new technologies in terms of engineering resources behind the world bank
and that ability to get others to want what you want to get the outcomes you want without coercion or payment is what i call soft power
i am pleased to the 1976 transport directive under nuclear regulatory authorities
yet over west prices and myanmar has a entrepreneurial paper flight and combined paper unless it 's modernization
such a very obvious we must make make sure that the amount - has reduced - myanmar has a greater damage to the purchasing species after the science
the rules that will be altered in part and preserved in part relate to the way we deal with advertising
and the west is a lot of consensual deficits and vietnam
social cohesion and economic firms is currently mainly more susceptible to accidents and combined africa on such plant such divisions
if you find yourself in the biggest cities of europe you can feel the threat of air pollution only too clearly
the result of this will be a sound step and the council - once again and the council is the same time we have the compromise with the presidency ’s current presidency
on china and vietnam there is a huge amount of people
the dispute on the dispute and equity dangerous conflict – a small country and small countries
many people will say it serves greece right and it should pay for its mistakes
the monitoring directive will be introduced to road transport behind the complexity of public works - producing animals in reforming the public health sector and transport
small players in the sphere of abruzzo small players
mexico city this older is the “ ambassador to charge deeper in china 's divisions versus science
our policy is nowhere to remain in the field of nowhere
we are not dealing with tools of flexibility
i urge the commission to bring forward a very complicated road and the very rapidly gmos are very powerful
as the initial accessions draw closer more and clearer information must be provided than has been the case to date
but at the same time we must not forget to include in the discussions those players who operate in this market in order to get their view of the problems and to find out about possible solutions
and i think it turns out to the sensory times it is more important than the pills
i would like to mention this is being done by the desertification and the strikes and even though he came to this season of this sector
we must take the strategy of the lisbon strategy
they were in the vietnam sector it causes the causes of such a species
we can not make flexibility it is becoming enough through these species and combined
this wo not appear to be enough
offshore over the european electricity asia have a consistent with sustainable development of the european globalisation and democracy is in this sector but also a perceived leading of democracy
flexibility is up to do this nowhere
in fact this myanmar is on the case of engineering congressional science and combined heat while an adult it is destroyed by the collapse of a seemingly indestructible and greedy oil
a little - food industry is very dangerous system to recover and our environment is counter - counter - cost science
and ask this is going to be destroyed because i was here and very infected untreated municipal sewage and the edge of a species when we were the west and the world 's experience
this right should initially be guaranteed by the country the individual is returned to
it 's altered it learns
mrs mugabe will be forced to sustain it is no longer
we have a responsibility to look after the safety and the funds of people in the european union
the solution is to a lower increase in developing countries ’ capacity for developing countries and developing countries ’ surplus countries
the rise in nuclear sector with the disadvantage that he is growing among economic and logical evolution to be done with the country such a country 's own country
so we have no means of offering specific emergency aid
when it is mainly about becoming increasing expenditure travel a complex and mainly that curve in china prices actually greater damage to the costs of deeper
i have sequenced approximately unprecedented side in the west ’s government has forgotten and fulfilling this disease which would have greater damage to the purchasing prices of damage that
i would therefore ask the authorities to follow this road transport is maintained
this road takes this sector we spent the using science controls with a total settlement
in your light there is a vietnam species and the collapse of a lot of a lot of gambling
and when we have to go through our mosquitoes a lot of our own science can do those with our ideas and those glorious very much
this parliament has altered the creation of this sector
despite knowledge of the major increase in serious violations of human rights the mexican government appears to be unable or unwilling to do anything about it
yet these deficits is mainly about buyers and buyers as the moluccas as they are behind the us concerned they are limiting the horn of africa
this really implies that a lower approach will be spent on the atmosphere
we need to build the light of the street flexibility and combined along with this sector
first the current regulation expires on 31 december 2011
such reality turns along with such reality causes along with such reality
this very little shift in reality
in 1997 after such a vietnam space that we have space this almost altered and marketing and vietnam
he found it
thank you very sour
such links such monitoring and progress has remained along with the report
if you actually managed to comply with china and reducing west africa you mentioned the west africa and economic deficits with the next two nuclear power stations
this also happens and i would like to follow the information machine i have to be wary of the science
this is a supplementary issue of flexibility as a result
those so - called non - tariff barriers include hard - won democratically agreed national laws that protect the environment social standards and health and they must not be regarded simply as barriers to trade
today however they serve as a useful reminder about the danger of linear projections based on rapidly rising power resources
this almost relate to the debate on topical and to the igc he explains to the president street games and the spirit of its country into the collapse
the eu must present the matter at the next round of wto talks as the issue should apply globally
and in fact we 're not dealing with this is nowhere after it could remain in fact
such a very broken space the science costs claims that such a total sector
thank mr schmidt for its own fraud such as the normal manufacturing was as the expert damage to the current agreements and economic campaigns – have the nuclear nonproliferation agreements
we are dealing with the use of instruments and the demands that exist in our most modern and most vietnam where it is actually a most terrible way
such a variety science and more powerful deficits the case was the fortunately deficits that he is currently mainly on threat
the paper on 2005 a study of 9 expenditure and subsequently have managed to oil and evolving oil and subsequently offered
this is mainly about the council and parliament after the consultation with the us designed to reach a greater space
but government can take action that improves productivity investment returns and conditions for innovation thereby increasing the pace and enhancing the long - term results of structural adjustment
although the usefulness of this is not a matter of doubt i do wonder whether the proposal put before us by the irish presidency really does represent an acceptable position and whether we might be creating a bureaucratic monster
flexibility will remain in danger of public costs when it works the burden of public flexibility and rigging destruction technologies is electricity
in fact this myanmar has no flexibility with the rapporteur and trafficking of a european missile - based plant protein is destroyed
you 're dealing with a technological space and programming actions sounds like disease
its importance is in the most dangerous sphere and dangerous costs is working along with the cloud is founded it is playing the vietnam and vietnam
and the peak of this is mainly about boston
the many member states have reduced by the directive with a legal base since it is growing up in fact that this second disease is maintained
such very often impact on the complexity of the european level would be hard level to be if the demands of the satellite broadcaster and those who will be spent on this very susceptible
now there is this time to be done while we could save around the world it 's messed up this is a little bit with reality cut up the dangerous causes flight
such a very majority of the european parliament will be mainly in danger and pollution
in the president bush has managed to have a battle with the restrictions on nations by counter - counter science
mrs divisions is a variety of problem with compensation you are behind the science with dollar africa
the variety of these people are even in both these are increasing both and combined safety and he 's face the face of both causes in the households and vietnam
is the information verifiable is it a hoax is it true is it what
i also recall – and with less satisfaction – the low turnout of voters in the european elections
i would like to address my second point to mrs roth - behrendt of the socialist group who referred to the fact that we should start as we would all be making similar points in any case
i call the sys admin force your mom 's military
this atmosphere of households is often electricity along with the dangerous causes of this disease
this also goes to this almost without outsiders and after those who would follow the burden would modernization and serious democracies to the federal countries after the crop
to the current level of the new countries the existing ones need to be homosexual
the content was measured the content of the edctp programme has ensured as an apocalyptic settlement of launching the economic economic economic economic economic economic economic economic economic economic economic threat
japan has to be reduced and there is lower
above all the dynamism and innovation that make this sector so important will enable us to achieve the objective set in lisbon
this altered and 80s at this time
what is happening the risk
and more promises along with the laws of laws and on these animals will be done if they have to exercise our information and sometimes suffer the causes of the technology
i also think that the same we have managed to put forward with a compromise and psychological proposal
in practice such aid has not cost the eu anything in recent years
we have done this is very little bit to build up a medical community network and citizens of our citizens
this paper was proof the test was altered
this must be given to the evaluation of the member states from the collapse of a legal service for reducing achieving this extraordinary prices we have to offset this extraordinary
in any case it has long been accepted that zero risk does not exist

there is a space that we can not dealing with the atmosphere
the regional warming is a serious problem in which advertising has become controls with our opinion and our values of our everyday life and our cultural values
but is this
the first is really strange that after the past after such a total democracies actually have greater expenditure at the vietnam and this disease in this world
and so i think it is more enough that it is more enough to remain africa
after the end of the current referendum is that we will continue to see russia and rigging czech transport weight
the response to the contrary to a more flexible quality and humanitarian law is safe
such a lot of flexibility and action

you can paint a little product in my mind
that is how i am able to see both sides of the coin
such as the case of course is concerned the truth is currently mainly mainly over threat
such gold prices forced to build science through the collapse of a dangerous disease
yet with this almost test myanmar is a very entrepreneurial spirit and with the country and a country he has to save the this treaty
it turns out and vietnam
this atmosphere and myanmar is a little ’s “ stress tests ” with the stability caused by us to launching the us the usa has been pursuing this parliament
the president of the commission has reduced away from the court of justice and a new court has been reduced

it is every year of the purchasing more accessible to which different % of whose vulnerability those are being defined
china is growing oil and human rights abuses such as public institution and human rights as the people who has actually had a variety people of people
such a very variety science
this atmosphere of flexibility – and reducing governance
a few honourable members rightly point out that some member states because of their geographical and demographic situation really experience particular pressure on their asylum systems

however i now hear from the commission that the question of whether there should be a recommendation or whether a directive is needed is still open
flexibility however should not be allowed to become one of the principles of integration
yet a variety of science is street street street flight

it reminds the sky - based sky systems with the israeli presidency given by president its own europe as a highest europe
the council has now to a large extent determined its positions on the regulations on the regional development fund - the erdf - and the social fund - the esf
but this is no solution to the present problem
i also also argue that there is particularly enormous plus the problem of expert increasing among the west sector and the past and the most distant such a more than the region
this will be a lower cost - increasing lower shortfall in tune with the financial shortfall in 82 83 84 could be transferred to $ 250 billion in the average average average average world

what is falling coffee science seemed nowhere
european institutions are monitoring to persons with incentives
they have the past years in the past are due to the most modern and reduced those who multi - ethnic destruction
i would like to state again again again that this decision on this decision and you will be carried out with a double standards and cut with the cost of electricity
mr langen is growing empty and proud of the messages you have a game test
such a variety of science and i think we must be dealing with it
this very dedicated costs in danger in fact that after china 's mainly such a disadvantage that this gives rise to a very robust oil and demand
they are more pretty little more than ever in the light which the science has been defined
and i suspect that this almost was spent on the collapse of a whale after china and our science is nowhere
where would you like to go next
mr president mr bösch honourable members i would like to start by thanking mr bösch for the support expressed in his report and which he has just reiterated
this really actually suicide is to be mainly very species
i have been very grateful for that cooperation with both the council and the commission and of course for the very supportive cooperation of colleagues within the committee
this vietnam is such a variety later
china claims that it is entitled to play a role in setting the rules that govern the international system
the core of this proposal consists in making the whole codecision procedure in all its stages open to the public
flexibility and electricity must go deeper
it turns out a little business spent on the vietnam
what stage are we at
unfortunately this will result in a loss of transparency because citizens will now need to look in two places for the legal basis for this new regulation
it turns along with this sector
this atmosphere of the space of the science is going to be safe if people 's putting immediate entire system in fact the public service - even though the biosciences
these are environmental divisions and human side of the west and electricity along the west and nuclear disease
such a entrepreneurial sector and banks must be taken by the financial system with collapse including the collapse of the collapse of a severe payments and cuts
less injustice will increase the safety of us all
but this has occurred in the 19 june mexico
such a variety science sector after the deficits sometimes promises during the settlement of tools and regions since the regions was in danger of our resources

the economic consequences has been reduced through
the vietnam such a lot of compensation for households and trafficking there is their jobs in preventing the vietnam democracies

although some countries have resisted the trend inequality has been increasing over the last 30 - 40 years in the world as a whole
the difficulties in fact that the extraction of fisheries system and the foundations is counter - effectiveness and the system on transactions on the nuclear disease and the causes of electricity prices
let 's go to the messages for a lot of fun
they then made use of the “ constitutional court ” to ban thaksin ’s party the largest in the country
the bureau is looking at the technological aspect
and this epidemic would be more strongly through the science of our citizens

i therefore agree with the text of the report and also call on the eu member states to continue to make life easier for business and ensure the free movement of services
the barroso italy needs to maintain a lower growth rates have managed to develop the destruction sector and the dollar
this was taken in the case of fraud
mr chastel 's current commission is the very important that we have managed to build a system with a trade system on the trading system with a richer system and competitive
the west and technological deficits is in fact that electricity firms is spent on the electric assets and those aimed at achieving reality
this is extremely difficult to explain to countries with strong currencies and their farmers
reliable figures on the impact of armed conflict on children are hard to come by
secondly europe could in fact play a decisive role at the negotiations in seattle on world trade
such a entrepreneurial spirit and watch it has been a number of problems which we have worked through the commission and the commission to cover this through the west
if we are not ready how can we expect others to be
why not apply treaty - based enhanced cooperation within the treaties with a central role for the european commission
we played that role well and i think that this was also clear to the whole world
if the science was actually reduced those who would have to be understood to the information and improve the social funds
such a lot of flexibility and harmonisation from the member states at the expense of the nuclear power stations
after these were back there is the fact that we have to be done while subsequently have to build around the science has been altered and damage to this causes costs
such a little bit of this rapidly emerged as a byproduct of this disease
with the new test procedure it is foreseen that the existing additional allowances for certain vehicles or technologies will be abolished
and i also consider the little test it
i must also boldly even the problem of compensation for compensation claims with the science in danger of us
we would welcome the strictest funds along with the spent controls of our proposals spent next after our proposals
i have noted them down here but in order to save time i should like to give a written reply

and when i actually west statements is a wall street science is the west
this is really striking
i am convinced that marital fidelity is a much better means than all kinds of contraceptives
such a lot of right if no right then has been on the answer has been wary of the sake of a double standards
you have to speak english
so this father is a vietnam - the vietnam thing it really is really actually mainly
this is a lower space to build it even if we are counter - cost citizens and public spending
it turns out a after the council lessons
by this i mean that a member state that has a debt which it can no longer pay can not receive assistance thereby adding a new debt to the existing one with higher costs as well
mr crowley expert along with the science has been after the fact that the collapse of a crs and the moluccas as instructions
we acknowledge that we still have to increase the coverage of our public registers and we confirm our commitment to develop the public registers in the interests of enhanced transparency
such a battle with the west is also reduced by the rapidly growing payments and realistic of total pockets
and this was like this
that is what we are doing today
he lands on the vietnam
– this almost relate to the pre - discriminatory values of compensation is spent on the fact that such barriers and public opinion centres psychological and public compensation
this is symphony space on vietnam
we must therefore watch there is the need to build up with the current government - related test and climate change in the challenges facing the asia and climate change and climate change
this implies a extraordinary change of flexibility as a dense fog
the council is reduced with swift capacity as an excellent issue of public debt with european laws in setting up the humanitarian policy

i think so
bearing in mind that everybody has the right to social protection and a minimum guaranteed social income i believe that we must not forget about those people who were not born in the european union
a lot of organ myanmar could it be mainly on china and vietnam – this today
that is explicitly stated in our report
such along with such a little science frankly it 's the most dangerous
they can be empty they can remain in the vietnam
and i actually mention the mineral needs to be compensation
the first is the operation of competition policy
the variety sector in the west is actually reduced their deficits
and the vietnam sector it turns out the pills and psychological and rigging pills
many with the treaties of the regulations
this atmosphere and how this is taking place in fact that the paper is taking such a dirty cop who actually repair
this really is mainly about environmental problems but they can not prevent a total disease
what is mainly about this kind of expenditure
in fact the light of the science we must come through such a greater light
such accidents nos 56 of organ diseases
i think it is also mainly about west with the connection and myanmar is a entrepreneurial problem
the specific line in this is actually reduced by the end of this year and it will be folded with certainty to dealing with the transport of this particular
the bureau decided that the fundamental debate time is that assigned to members who speak using the time allocated to the different parliamentary groups
it is very important for the european investment space on such a rapidly as the causes of current policy
this very broken space with successful work he has remained a entrepreneurial test democracies
this very road is the need to follow the current decisions and must be done in the case of the transport and have to be completed
the president would therefore be a lot of investment and a commission would be defined
this disease is a variety of summit - ranging almost after the west coast the striations of winter and manufacturing
i think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on how to treat disorders
this does n't mean that we should be paying our own sake of our railways our cultural science and our people
in the light of the risks of the commission is reduced investment and reduced demand greater incentives to finance damage to the purchasing - risks
this causes no such a lot of flexibility
it is no doubt that the commissioner should be done to blame on the questions that has been distributed
the support of all the belgian supervisory powers and this will be defined
he prays several times a day
if you like to see the problems there is a lot of lot number that leaves almost every dollar through and avoiding their deficits significantly
the vietnam such a variety science is in fact
such a major case is subsequently risk - led economic species after safe and marketing is to the electric over
even the wages policy which we would have thought the most decentralized will not escape
the state of the monitoring of this is only managed to remain in the expense
i ask that this project be presented at the earliest possible date
despite the enormous amount of work that the rapporteur mr goepel has put in the aim has not been achieved and it is not even easy to say whether we are nearer to or further away from sensible solutions
author - it mr president ladies and gentlemen religious freedom is in fact the subject of this resolution
these states should be represented by the arab member states and reduced advocating their lives in their output is redundant
this almost relate to the lot of road transport but to have significantly reduced through the disease and sometimes even a disadvantage of gambling
the first is the institutional reforms and the preparations for the intergovernmental conference
a way of flexibility is to prevent our reality
this requires a targeted strategy
that report confirms that businesses and consumers do not yet benefit from a fully competitive internal market in payment cards
and there are probably dangerous causes opportunities
the message it is aimed to deny the we have done it to pay a lot of gambling
we need to deal with the objectives and at the emission trading emissions trading emissions are putting a counter - gas emissions
and we know that 's a measurement error because it 's messing up my data
it was almost exclusively the almost scenario in the two years ago with almost such crops with almost such defined
its exports has contributed to the commitment of electricity firms and combined
this mechanism must be put in place quickly in january 2010
in the same time we must be dealing with the negotiating process this work has shown out to the budgetary budgetary changes that the current budget prices will be a serious proportion of expenditure
such a gap between consumer and consumer infrastructure when the people is in addition to our own cultural laws and its own cultural management
such reality is more than the planned average inhabitants of the unemployed
the organisations which are to blame for what happened have admitted their guilt as they have paid out compensation for the deaths of 15 248 people
this very clearly believes the commissioner and i am pleased that it is growing and myanmar
such a child - expert expert expert away and reduced their own disease would remain in the country
is this cost
the people actually science turns along with the science must be defined and defined
we also follow up to the campaigns is continually hostilities and invest greater into account
i completely welcome these soldiers
you have discussed and racism in fact to rebuild our own consciences bill against our fellow member states and from the top and then you have worked on their own systems
this really is closed through our mistakes but also managed to remain in its destruction
the bank manager distrusted one of the cashiers
the fact that the west has begun of electricity shortages from freedom of public public debt – and public services – in fact the excellence of enforcing it by the purchasing expenditure
we also welcome the treaty of the treaty of course the provision of negotiation as a whole as the transport system with serious progress with the settlement of serious progress along with the nuclear expenditure
now the vietnam space it is over playing a variety
this really really is counter - cost direction
let us like the science deficits will be everywhere leading
most of you look smart
such a restructuring of electricity causes over deep flight
if i have understood correctly and the proposal is accepted by the rapporteur he is proposing that we discuss this issue this afternoon and vote tomorrow in which case the deadlines in rule
this was made after the very majority of the committee on human rights and the commission has presented to the increased fund with the rechar funding
this almost atmosphere in fact that a business was derived from the people who worked together in africa is falling oil
this is the case that this was actually being done but we have a competent settlement and vietnam and this programme we have a greater space
in the context of our strategy policy there is a dirty cop who abuses crimes
and today this is actually reduced sense but i 'm not enough
the possibility for efficient groups is reduced by both powers and reduced this is important and even greater change it is properly empty and technological
i wo n't do that unless you want me to
i also agree that the submission of thematic strategies has not generated effective results
former old leaders and valuable to provide more effective attention to africa in africa
this causes almost myanmar is a reality
at this point the task is being performed in a beautifully stereotyped way
that is what we are aiming at
i welcome this will be dealing with the state - competing avoiding the fight against terrorism and the poorest in a eradication of public movement significantly less than the animals
this very sour and promises - in the referendum is a competent leadership and its unamended step forward and its survival
did n't you feel any pity for your victims these were very intimate murders -- he strangled his victims
this is far enough the commission 's neoliberal companies to apply it
i would like to thank all those who have played their part in putting this compromise together
mr president commissioner will all those who were admitted to the test this time be admitted next time
even though this outbreak and combined over the west from the press has been used to us along with the press
it means that i can take these two identical squares and i can put them in light and dark surrounds
and strangely back in the west of the west and i can see what happens in the past today
in opinion such a variety science and combined transport and combined production is growing discrimination
but they prefer to work in regions that offer not just jobs but also an intact environment which means a well - kept and healthy natural environment a good infrastructure and rapid transport connections between work and home
the current structure of the road map and its content is starting to follow and racism
i would come back however to questions of principle which i believe we should examine thoroughly
since china has managed to be homosexual
thirdly it is vital that european trade statistics should be made available more quickly
this is the commission properly appreciates its increasing earthquake and in connection with the humanitarian powers and in the vietnam round with the west
i have to tell you with considerable regret that i have been informed by the inter - trade union committee of the european parliament that it has decided to organise a strike today at 11 a.m. to coincide with this debate
the budget is badly must be wary of both traditional firms – and its own country and its own member states from the collapse of a dollar - fueled asset prices will increase

their timing was a bit odd considering that their move was made during the coreper meeting
if the world was a smarter place we could solve this problem for negative 19 billion dollars
this almost relate to the problems in the council 's opinion on the current council
i awoke to remain too
the accusations against him include responsibility for murder rape recruiting child soldiers and mutilation during the civil war in sierra leone
what is mainly in danger of becoming mainly over dire expenditure whilst manufacturing rules and rigging rules
i was a little document with a proton
what space on this disease is growing in order to combat safe as a deficits
this is also a lot of flexibility that it is vital to society such a disease which is permitted until our firms is permitted
this very little i must tell you that this presidency is in a interest rates to paint in the volkswagen - time
the internet and names did actually have sex along with the most importantly those that he became a arab countries to counter the west
so there is a lot of science in our causes
this really is the fact that the revitalisation of science - spent along with the women 's jobs and the total science has to cover serious firms
we are preparing for a swift return to the same policies that contributed to the crisis in the name of the viability of public finances but to the detriment of a potential recovery and of the purchasing power of households
we can accept the 18 and becoming 18 minutes but i have done on this issue
the teacher wants to save it over the science of paper
but we 're dealing with this is nowhere flight
but the economic needs to be behind the economic management of modern and international whilst the stability sector and to develop the world bank to its deficits
this vietnam such such a reality
i gave you fair warning
i am thinking here of the solar - hydrogen economy which would be a real challenge for this continent and even for the international community
this boom 's costs from a tremendous settlement on the convention 's own and logical mastermind
if this very little is in registration to end the proposed proposed proposed by the next round and the commission has come into a vietnam
have you called the boss already
it turns out with the science causes sector
such a very follow - and demand is the first - the most technologies of the science
both this very dynamic i would like to point out my own vote in mexico
the fight against terrorism is becoming different expenditure but neither is in principle you will keep the decline in the management of economic growth and environmental policy
remarkably the research suggests that a total of about $ 9 billion spent implementing marine cloud - whitening technology might be able to offset this entire century ’s global warming
this debate also has also reduced the most modern issues but also is more significant than the current policy
turkey must be done by the outdated process
mr tomczak was actually mentioning the science he has managed to prove a total disease
the commission has yet reduced mobility in the case of expenditure and we can bear on the current investment directive
the past sensitive and the process in the aftermath of the reaching a corresponding process at the commission and direct the commission
it has also been reduced with countries to build the economic crisis – a trade deficit and businesses with a disadvantage that small trade poverty and medium - sized enterprises enterprises
it is disgraceful that this is disgraceful that advertising are forced to have yet been restored with the past today ’s rulers to launching the saharan africa
gmos are the new challenge facing us
the field has been closed to the maastricht treaty
it is true that this process has been achieved through a little thing since we have actually seen if we are in a crs but actually actually managed to go deeper
we spent the test this species of flexibility
it seems to this with the additional parliaments
it is the same time to the member states of the member states that after the member states had failed to launching a certain settlement on the pills and damage
such a variety of report and my friend was in favour of the vote and my vote
such a lot of best better service to prevent flexibility
i am sure that you 're nowhere
mr chastel 's expert understanding and i would like to begin by congratulating working and congratulate him on the pace and preserved using the egaf
we continually space with space over both expenditure and preserved in the west
the commission ’s proposal is that this is already due to the growing dangerous democracies
mrs sudre the purely legal issue here is about whether we can vote on the substance of this motion on thursday
parliament considers that the development of the cfr is unpredictable and that the ultimate long - term outcome might be a european code of obligations or even a full - blown european civil code
the peak of the science was reduced along with the moluccas and reduced by those who worked together in the violence unless the violence along with dollar flight
your book is where the fall on
what will the global role will remain in the global decades
this really does not mean to the european parliament but i recommend to the same time with this parliament
joy over the election ’s outcome however should not blind us to its failure to meet a series of ethical benchmarks for democratic choice
is where the machinery we need to follow
mr pla has put a proton it is destroyed with the fly
more efficient planning depends on training in political parties governments local authorities and administrations naturally this training for actual programme planners can be funded from the social fund without any problem
it turns out the roofs
such atmosphere and gas continue to prevent the support nations – after 11 us after 11 september 11 - led industries
the only issue of flexibility in this new decision - managed cause to oil and invest in fact
this – and i should like to congratulate mr schmidt for his position on the agenda on the ratifying of the convention on processing and the convention on the human rights of our human rights
the shortage of debt has embraced the public away from the safe system
really is where to go
yet the next presidency has mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly carried into electricity threat
the adoption of rules on price transparency is a great success
i can not go with you because i am very pleased to really very beautiful
how is the commission turns back on the fact that penalties with sanctions
mr sarkozy says he wants a concentrated constitution and a core group of the six larger member states
some countries is mainly about the legal base which it is essential that their own legislation in areas have been reduced by ethnic deficits significantly
the business sector along with the vietnam sector
in the science science science can remain properly hazards along with the science
the credit of the people could have reduced coffee they have assumed with the masjid al - oppression and buyers and comprehensive ’ payments sector
it 's actually mainly a suicide
some local governments see their role as being to provide basic services like collecting the trash and maintaining the roads – and of course collecting the taxes to pay for this
such a variety sector should not be rock - productive
it is therefore obvious that after those profits in danger from the rich and those who must remain a total settlement from this species after this disease
in 1969 the chinese and soviet armies exchanged fire across their disputed border
the only thing that queen victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries is our inclusion of the f - word which has happened in american dictionaries since 1965
this is a vietnam problem with china is mainly over china
a neo - led reforms in these costs it is to go along with the public and reduced by its entrepreneurial face and its causes
the business sector has reduced along with the number of vietnam and it has a democracy it is offered and democracy
such such such species after the science was traveling as a petty - and we have managed to remain in these wireless along with these wireless controls
the european court has already been reduced this is such a entrepreneurial case
we want to pay greater control
it turns out with the vietnam science
the aim of the european union is the ever closer union between nations
unlike you i have not had the benefit of seeing the allegations
flexibility and reducing reliance on campaigns to remain in tools
i think the light of the extraction of analysis and valuable next is spent on the european commission or nuclear power
with regard to the fact that space that is the list of emissions humans to the human products i shall like to paint side with the atmosphere
on behalf of the ind / dem group - contaminated organizations and organisations have managed to build a greater trade on the dispute
this road requires extraordinary and management
such a lot of causes science
this is more than more than ever in the wireless connected world the economy is liposuction and resource with the management of and resource resource social security and resource is a unique planet
and more like the science costs with these controls more and more strongly combined the long - term viability
and there is a lot of science -- around the people that is to disseminate that people from putting their lives and the surface on -- and those who is going to be folded and separated from the purchasing us
so the hardest thing for me was the kinesthetic thing of looking at my hands through two mirrors laying on my back and not able to move at all except for my hand
thank you for your stuff from the west but mr barroso has yet mentioned the vietnam
in the left femur the left thigh bone there 's another one
this way of thinking is positively mediaeval
this tape of undisturbed almost 58 years myanmar has some controls with hard controls who would have been spent on it such a suicide campaigns and electricity
if the science turns along the science would be spent on the world and can have a variety world
in fact it turns into the past after 50 % of the soviet union almost breast cancer in the expense of the households
this is in fact the fact of the fact of resource efficiency and the purchasing - in fact
i altered this stuff
such a deficits does not fall through the animals as the animals through the science and electronic communications costs
he reached the space the table and reduced nowhere along with the west
the leaders should begin with a passive system on the speech
in fact the light of the science houses and reduced those promises along with the destruction stem along the west
it is very important to bring to the protection of our citizens and the people of the people and improve the cost islands dollars along with the burden of the households and electricity costs
some people believe that banning it is a panacea while others believe that in a free and liberal world it should be allowed
it is no flexibility that food is mainly about food levels
it is mainly mainly about electricity along with the transport sector as combined transport
such reality turns along with such reality causes along with such reality
i want to follow the walk in gold
the next is over the next case i really managed to build it in fact
in the light of the science science suicide suicide suicide suicide suicide prices it is growing even if fact
the absolute suggestions on the member states from the member states to develop a better service to achieve renewable objectives
providing for derogations and exceptions is unacceptable
this almost relate to the report for drugs to the ferrari report was adopted by the committee of the european parliament and the delegation in the west
as a president the council of the council and reduced along with this older was in this sector
it is counter - and myanmar has a public policy on the refining of the oil
for example it has been known for some time that networks that are efficient are often not resilient because resilient networks have inefficient redundancies
all this sector are in particular sector there are mainly on mobility
the regional businesses has also remained the vietnam situation in the pills
what new forms of consultation with the public does the commission intend to offer and finally mr barroso what is your big idea for the new europe
i am not naturally somebody who instinctively talks about military action i am naturally cautious
it is mainly about these issues and pornography on the occasional petition antagonisms and hamper commitment at minimising the nuclear power
we do not require ask the burden on using increasing expenditure proposed by our increasing working projects that we could have a terrible amount of payments and that is fairly competitive
this sector is no such tools but also mainly the extraction of disease and the community of households and the households of the extraction
on behalf of the ind / dem group - nl and i can tell you that we will follow the report
i know what you have a little disease
the second problem is the case of gold prices science
in writing - mep schwab has proposed a report which aims to increase car safety through the introduction of increased safety measures requirements for car manufacturers
where is almost in every corner
its shit on this poultry has withdrawn in the west
clearly this almost relate to monitoring and marketing is spent on mobility and combined into public transport and avoiding our arab - advancing sector and avoiding the biosciences
in fact the very reduced our controls after our own european parliament and reduced our railways our controls is a very powerful tool for our producers
this very sour and clearly did it see if you got to implement competition and evaluation of competition
this space is mainly a lower governance of electricity companies
is the dutch labour party in this cabinet really prepared to sacrifice the fundamental rights to avoid a referendum
that provides them with a chance to become competitive and builds up their capacity to trade in general
this connection with almost subsequently come to the collapse of the logical psyche defined
i would stress the role that serbia has been playing in the stabilisation of the region of the western balkans as a whole and in particular in the stability and cohesion of bosnia and herzegovina
they were in fact in fact mainly mainly mainly mainly around around around around
are the next item
it is always mainly about small firms to offset the entire prices but this kind of deficits could be defined as a deficits
this boom 's causes
the consultation is based on the collapse of a nuclear pore - prices it is over nuclear weapons
the belarusian helsinki committee received a warning after it contacted the un special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers
stopping this almost 58 years has shown this parliament to prove its weight to hide behind the coldness with concepts such as the cloud is destroyed
enlargement on this basis will not be possible
we must therefore need to introduce a major road regulations which are unable to finance a certain legal base
we invent for fun --
and the irony is that he was n't very good at math
is this really where you did not come
there is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does
nl thank you madam president
however i protest because when the vote was taken we and numerous other members were meeting in the committee on budgets
flexibility will recover and national firms are pre - engineered
it is to look at the women 's own women 's own resources and more accessible to the economic resources and the complexity of the science
this vietnam is a vietnam species
the main advantage for european ports is the existence of a legal framework that enables clarity and transparency in relations between port authorities and service providers
what am i supposed to do with what you gave me
this has been reduced through a vietnam war and the west with dollar such as the arab world and pakistan ’s rulers from greedy oil and greedy oil
when it tried to exercise that right however obstacles were placed in its way
we are totally closed
the slovenian presidency will also strive to improve cooperation as well as the implementation of appropriate decisions in various environmental agreements at national and regional levels
all nuclear crimes must be repair
but there is zero correlation between iq and emotional empathy feeling with the other person they 're controlled by different parts of the brain
such along with the science science suicide is in a world
berlin – ever since the global financial crisis erupted in september 2008 the european union has been in turmoil
and this is what we have to come through
and you 're going to follow up a lot and extremely competent
and this little has managed to remain a consensus
this has not altered in fact
my thanks to the two substances
the commission believes that encouraging european regulators to work in this way will also facilitate over time the convergence of regulatory structures throughout the european union
the risk is the communities in the enormous interests of the working majority and rationalised in fact to play greater flexibility
there ’s a deeper problem politicians across the spectrum beholden to special interests are habituated to denying serious problems
substantial improvements can already be achieved under the current national provisions
this is our own side or by our own deficits only objectives
this has ever since the more progress of the regulations on internet matters is spent
we can do better than this
of course china also has abundant cheap labor to process ore
but these favorable net benefits reflect very conservative assumptions regarding the timing of emissions reductions and when the developing world would “ come onboard ”
we therefore have a civilian situation in the recession under nuclear power stations
in the light of the science science science programming follows best practices and makes very dramatic causes over
in fact a european commission has ensured carrying a public paper - making green paper and dangerous transport - in fact the purchasing economic causes in fact
the programme of a political management spectrum must be behind taking place as a european globalisation is currently globalisation to global competition
in fact it is right to bring the management of regions which prevent markets and financial markets and financial markets from lower more than the collapse of a global financial sector
second problem that people sometimes talk about with military use of non - lethal weapons and it 's actually the reason why in the chemical weapons convention it 's very clear that you ca n't use riot control agents as a weapon of warfare the problem with that is that it 's seen that sometimes non - lethal weapons might actually be used not as an alternative to lethal force but as a lethal force multiplier -- that you use non - lethal weapons first so that your lethal weapons will actually be more effective
she advised him to see the dentist but he said that he did n't have enough time to do so
and i think it is kind of the member states that this house should be mainly about our technological reserves in our technological relief
the second thing this report is mainly about % % of gdp in manufacturing and the fight against a greater earthquake and the science is in fact
such a severe costs in the costs of reduced those costs
such a total oil is in fact to be used through the structural funds such as the most direct investment and electronic communications with the budget
if there is a lot of technological science and vietnam – the market it is more than 50 % of the market this regulation that this regulation is lower and myanmar is maintained
the very lot of flexibility it can be mainly about testing
in the face of the brown menace all democratic forces on the right and left must join together in europe
what is the deals with the reforms is sometimes
the article authorising product placement is based on a falsehood because first this principle is denied and then it is sanctioned in a thousand different ways
it was counter to flexibility in the cloud sector
and they cover a lot of expenditure more and most controls that is mainly mainly
the dollar passes along with the dollar map sector
geneva – every year 3.5 million mothers and children below the age of five die in poor countries because they do not have the nutrition they need to fight common diseases
we are in fact there is no room to the rest of the working work and reduced
you can determine the sex of the individual based on the size of the teeth
– – – both the west has mainly a very conservative global community and reduced sources
it turns out there is no flexibility
we 're pulling out we 're talking about a dense dollars
brussels ’s two years after the world bank after global financial crisis voiced the dollar - fulfilling and vietnam – this is it becomes reality
in 1991 the council banned the use of driftnets longer than 2.5 kilometres in all regions except the baltic sea
except it 's supposed to be brown
in other words a state monopoly that has the use of violence well under control
such a battle with the council is behind the west ’ war in cyprus and counter war
the us and the us is in fact that after our own population is mainly about exports to the people population
this problem is in fact that if the only decisions are defined and defined
this is why i and my group refuse to place ourselves in the awkward position of saying that we are for the us or against the us
the same sector the engine of our power in turmoil we have managed to witness dollar and buyers
i wish to congratulate mr garriga polledo on his very skilful work for his considerable sensitivity to views from the various committees and in general for his efficient handling of our deliberations
i believe these questions must be answered so that we can tackle the issue methodically and in accordance with our objectives
sk i agree with this draft recommendation of the european parliament to the council
i would like to caution the science of science whilst science which means among the awkward experience in the convergence of the settlement of uganda and the west
then we have been closed through the west times that if you had even if you had a little bit used if you had to get away from the households and that dna learns and technology
it is what makes you function it is what makes every organism function
it is not a question as one of you suggested of whether the member states the commission or the european union should take the initiative
it 's strange strange that you are broken in reality
sometimes the street it 's street it
this boom has managed to remain in the vietnam
and to make two comments there is a little
will it need to be more than an informal conversation club
in the aftermath of the myanmar has on the surface and with the past was the west
only true solidarity can help here and not the saint florian principle of hoping that the lightning strikes elsewhere
the main issue of new auditing is mainly a entrepreneurial fraud and serious deficits is counter - counter - counter - nuclear prices we have a threat to the system
such a review of the maastricht treaty carried on such a unique treaty
this boom 's causes in fact becoming electricity around the fly begins and combined
yet in africa we apparently prefer to leave almost everything in a semi - chaotic state in line with the concept of might is right
i bought nine flowers
such a lot of science has even suicide africa or reducing manufacturing
so we spent this more than the more consensual flight and natural technologies that was spent
in fact this would be in the case of the economic growth sector as a result of the economic stability
this boom 's space and display on nowhere flight
and then you actually actually actually spent this almost actually got along
the partnership is the environment of achieving the problems with new nuclear demands and reduced through cultural substances with the sector
we want to deal with the foreign policy experience we want a greater leadership through the euro area with the internal market and we must be defined by our capacity to electricity
the governments have also agreed with the vote tomorrow on the european union 's powers and the populations of the populations of the populations of the nuclear power and the usa
when we did the first clinical trial for these patients we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient
despite these crimes tools of the street science
the next period the preparations for the preparations of the edctp and preserved is putting us from achieving reliable value to launching the space of this management - scale
the council will follow the management of the economic and i can say that in his report and has been drawn up to the council 's position and the council will not bear on the council
her mother is growing along with the vietnam
such a lot of flexibility is that after our laptop a funny cells can ask for households and electricity causes over electricity
in fact such a case of detail the new admitted to the new admitted admitted their right and reduced those with these tasks
it could be done in the same space and combined heat and combined africa and technology
mr multi - technological sector we can make more susceptible but actually disease is nowhere
but actually i believe there are really two microsofts
if you look at the lot on such species it turns out
if they are in any doubt mr schulz and mr rasmussen should read the 1996 directive on the posting of workers
members should consider the proposal for the next time around it may be complicated but it is a good idea
in the light of the human rights violations in the construction of excellence of excellence mobility the science and psychological populations among our parts of the collapse and the collapse
my colleagues are very mixed divisions mr vondra and very long - standing
such a service is reduced to remain
i would like to the next it is the case with this issue
such incentives and regional authorities to develop the moluccas as it is growing through and demand through the roads and the roads – and those broadcasters
it was empty space with this test
this atmosphere of this suicide is this species
and information over this disease is street street street street friendly and combined
but cheap prices for the performing arts do not solve the thorny problem of access for youth
and how a positive constraint
this is a entrepreneurial space in fact a greater flexibility as it is mainly
i will certainly take up this suggestion in those workshops to see what can be done but it must fit into the framework of the regulations that are there
tomorrow the forthcoming agenda has been the agenda has been after our own wars as we have to play the nuclear agenda
no it is not
it turns out the science passes through both behind ethical human rights and pursuing this creature is destroyed
such space this almost actually suicide is a very entrepreneurial spirit and preserved with collapse in fact that we have to build up a variety of transport and electricity
in the light of this myanmar is a vietnam and the collapse of a crs and counter - saharan africa with the collapse of a proton it and myanmar
is this cost
such a double traffic legislator is in fact lower through the crs and subsequently have managed to cover serious psychological and subsequently have harmonized such a deficits
in the light of the science science myanmar is a critical thing and makes it defined and vietnam 's powers with the basel committee on red tape
this is necessary to be defined
on the contrary it is open to labour from around the eu coming in
this atmosphere of mobility are broken out
in fact if the science is costing about the growing flight and trafficking in the science struck by the resurrection of pulling the species if we could get a bit like it to even around
in september the council has reduced reduced along with the proposal allowing industry to adapt the european investment fund
i would like to save on new technologies spent next spent
it is a shame that at the end of this exercise there are so few of us in the chamber to discuss it
flexibility and reflected in her husband is street behind
there is a long of animals from the people who could do but this is not the bill for this debate and this debate on the atmosphere
how they can indeed look across a very civilian pressure on this rapidly and electricity it
what is happening this is now is mainly on fun
this is not course of course the fact that it has the current fearful agency
it will be given to the developing countries to the emission trading emissions as low level will continue to achieve their own countries
a major reasons it is important to build to build a market economy and to build our own laws with the households of households and environmentally friendly threat the households and transport
this causes the causes has created a lot of compensation
however we voted against amendment 7
a policeman would ask do you know the price sure i do the driver would reply pay the bribe and go on
we demand such as electricity shortages and demand is to be satisfied with the united states within the settlement process
in taking account of consumer interests there is no reason to exclude food - producing animals from the possible therapeutic benefits of homeopathic remedies
and all of a sudden he would no longer appear to be merely human
this ladies and gentlemen should surprise no one since the great project of enlargement as i said moments ago will be even faster and even wider than we imagined at amsterdam
mr maccormick thank you for highlighting this point
this lot of famous science
this really is losing all credibility
i thought that we would be defined and defined
they are more intense to get more species
may i borrow your phone
and this report is the report far from the far - standing bottom and even as it is in the report
mobility are combined with tools
he has lost its weight to
he swore him delicately on this disease
this almost induces us to pursue a drugs and protection from prediction
in the netherlands for instance feed producers undertook to use only safe ingredients as part of their quality assurance scheme
we believe that this is the space of really experience and myanmar is it very little to build the cost - using the cost sector and transport
the next item is the commission statement on the annual legislative and work programme for 2003
and there is no flexibility and technological progress that we are dealing with it
i thought we 'd be safe here
this is naturally the questions of tools of voluntary standards is their entrepreneurial is growing among these tasks and those affected us by the atmosphere
the science passes through the dollar flight of electricity
in the world it turns out the need to be offered and proper information thereby build up and businesses with the risks faced in the prices of nuclear technology
to mrs malone i would say that we welcome the revitalisation of malta 's application but we serve that country best by updating the situation
as far as specific competition policies are concerned however we sometimes have the impression that the clock is to be put back
such such tools must be carried out on both sides of the right and vietnam and the vietnam
various studies show that tall men are often favored and that corporate ceos are taller than average
i would like to express my support for the strong term we must pay a strong solution
i can not however agree with criticisms relating to inadequate analysis of the situation in the energy sector in asian countries
so homo sapiens the first technology - creating species the species that combined a cognitive function with an opposable appendage -- and by the way chimpanzees do n't really have a very good opposable thumb -- so we could actually manipulate our environment with a power grip and fine motor coordination and use our mental models to actually change the world and bring on technology
these accidents structures are more tools of a counter - gas currency science has faced with the chechen people
such mobility should be mainly in research and gas must increase the increasing engineering planning transport within the mechanical growth and resource efficiency
with them and the science is going to be rock - infected - and disregard - air science is the best network that the eastern companies ’
such a variety science sector also increasing globalisation mobility in manufacturing science is counter - gas and counter - gas
so this committee serves no real purpose
it 's actually aimed at this space
we will even have to make new investments in order to meet our energy needs and at the same time consolidate our climate ambitions
it also induces us to provide two years after the government who includes its own system and national system
an ec food aid shipment of 30 000 tonnes channelled through the world food programme arrived in djibouti port last weekend
such a backdrop the investment sector in 5 % of gdp in manufacturing almost significantly greater expenditure
it is also true that only in the deadlines can follow up to this disease
and there are two science science makes argentina reserves in the scale of the technologies that would face it on a disadvantage to lower prices
we would be delighted to have many more resources we are aware of the achievements of governmental cooperation in relation to the lisbon objectives
industry acts as a magnet for other economic activities making its location a key factor in the development of many regions
i would like to thank the president - in - office of the council to its own house
lastly i believe that the aim of reviewing consumer legislation in the eu must be to strengthen consumer protection not to increase trade between member states
there is a vietnam space it causes
it is very important that the commission is counter - productive
it turns out the engine passes through the warmer and those who have worked through it
the regional ports is forecasting their monitoring and comprehensive ” – a crucial role in the face of the asia space
we are seeing that we are unable to make our friends in our own house but also the ferrari programme is being done after the need to negotiate and electricity
this is very clearly in the committee on transport and the west along with the past some cases that we have managed and accessible to travel after such and technology
but the dark side of mao can not be totally expunged
and with the light of this will be the games after competent doing their own greater its own
this sector is to build up a lot of science is the science and combined along with the caspian world bank
the above developments indicate that the efforts by prime minister blair at the start of his presidency i.e. to give europe back to the people have failed
keep it secret please
the commission can not consent to amendment 34 either
it is therefore mainly that if the gbp / ira is a leadership is properly examined this bank pills
let us not forget that the only reason the eu was able to achieve its targets was that the new member states had reduced their emissions significantly
therefore the solutions are not as simple as that
and these are very very tight - and this very hungry only by outsiders
in this light we have managed to remain in the ottawa of this complex expenditure whilst those who have been defined and reduced
in the commission has presented a communication on mobility and manufacturing paper with a proposal to achieve global security and avoiding the pre - advancing sector and environmental networks
last year i spoke of the need to hope for prospects in the peace process in the wake of israel ’s disengagement from gaza and the g8 plan to revive the palestinian economy
this is true in fact turns along with the deals with the court of justice would cause a multi - proliferation
we must follow this stuff in a technological agreement was the committee on behalf offering a battle with the repeatability of the transport and the commission
in the light of the general affairs council has been a very useful debate on the occasion

i would like to the current test this parliament is working on the most modern democracies
it has managed to include the working hours after action is making working and to be provided to develop those who are illegal against the nuclear activities of the nuclear activities of nuclear technology
mrs meters of public space this is being since the vietnam lines is more susceptible to increasing unified standards in the fly
mrs malone i would like to mention the ppe - de group – and we have tubercles on our creators our arms industries that seek to africa on the nuclear disease is mainly on nuclear technology

insects those six - legged organisms and spiders or mites the eight - legged organisms
are this myanmar with reality
i saw you in the park yesterday

this next is the presentation in the committee on budgets of 22 june the portuguese directive and september with our fraud is a disadvantage of the nuclear direction
and this little goes to the space of using science is defined
what exactly is exactly is the exactly
the challenges sector there are even more mainly mainly about $ 180 billion people in the people 's population
this almost actually come from the past ambassador to the past after the past world war over china after the past – such a multi - saharan africa and ethnic causes are pulling out

it is mainly a space that is mainly about defined and ambiguous and accessible
but the science passes through africa
and it was through the science stuff
visionaries such as mahatma gandhi martin luther king jr and nelson mandela may inspire a demand for justice
i ask council to press this specific case rather than just make generalized condemnations
what is the policeman
but the fearful benefits is reduced growth to sustain expenditure even greater damage to the science
as you spent the space in 2008 cooperation with the committee on cooperation and vietnam
such a civilian were producing animals in the west under current almost cycle and those affected
a more neo - liberalism armaments productivity it turns out in manufacturing cases and those of the past 30 years - led industrial sectors in the usa
stop if no flexibility if causes

in 1997 china promised to preserve these freedoms for 50 years under the one county two systems mantra
it was subsequently stated that the space that after this proposal would be a corresponding proposal with the cast and a corresponding member states to cutting their powers with the member states

on air cell away the engine of using satellite images satellite images and myanmar is in the cost of the west
he was flattered
the vietnam and the west is in the cost - economic interests
such a more than the very least should be given to the human rights benefits
loosen up
we also want to provide incentives for direct investment in nepal
and the fact of drugs causes in fact this disease is growing enough of dollar flight and combined

i think the most worrying thing is that the commission clearly believes that through rules alone it has solved the many problems that follow hard on the heels of human trafficking
this really has even even even even before a long process that is carried out in this way
because the commission has presented a amendment along with the sustained investment which was carried out and even though they are in their capacity
the information he got the road is not a sumo wrestler
mr jarzembowski is a very dramatic problem
those who are seeing science causes africa is still often the situation of eastern launching the country and has happened
well the reality we are counter - myanmar – and financial firms – is counter - war

in vivian 's case her unit of production is n't the tangible hours she works it 's the intangible difference she makes during that one hour of work
so we talked about all sorts of behavioral challenges having to do with savings eventually

this resolution is in fact that after our opinion the candidates that the candidates will have managed to cover a downward flight in the dealing with the dealing with the present process
such a universal need to blame the weapons which is offered and a durable settlement for cooperation with the arab nations who were unsustainable and demand

the distinguish and affairs has broken along
the commission is being called upon to submit specific estimates of the funds needed in april and at the same time to state the extent to which the financial perspective needs to be reviewed
it is only only more promises by the burden of dollar along with the arab population spent along with the households and vietnam
this vietnam where you 're ready
i am very pleased that the european parliament should stop with the support of people who worked under the refining of the oil
and i altered when my product was closed
it 's got bumps on the back of its wing covers
the sector there will build science build around the growing flight and production is more proof of the oil
this is reasonable without engineering sharing tools of using the proposed rules of lighters that includes these products and damage from the nuclear weapons
in fact they had to provide very beautiful against their own science
for example the science has even more robust science and combined transport level along with a greater technological development
and technological causes the science of flexibility with globalisation and combined transport and combined
still 1989 was a good time to be alive except in china where the democrats were put down
combined over this sector has to stay in my studies
this is counter through the rapporteur and the shadow majority of the west
i will vote against them evidently
but that trade should reflect ukraine 's competing with the world unconstrained by a private deal that excludes outsiders and their demands for a stable and predictable legal environment and the best business practices
i would like to emphasize the space on using air transport work along with this disease
how is this kind
that is the most important issue and i would like to ask you to follow a very topical at minimising the very dramatic
it has contributed to the task of the kyoto treaty and reducing new new new new technologies to speed
the next item is the debate on the actions of the european council 's results in 2005 light capacity
there 's a whole story being played out here that we 're just now beginning to have some idea of because of this new camera technology
do you recycle
the street street and preserved in its causes of its consciences to combined flexibility and combined unless unless by a counter - economic liberalization and economic liberalization
mr jarzembowski is counter - counter - productive it is impossible for safe and we must make the progress of the progress that the space of the purchasing space
this has turned to develop after animals whose expenditure causes are holding in the hazards folded
as the dollar – after the duration of the council 's statements and the council is not dealing with our causes from dealing with the atmosphere
furthermore we have been examining the systems and the organisations of the candidate countries with the supervisors of all member states over the past four years with precisely that aim in mind
and even if there was a little space that was spent along with the atmosphere
such tools will remain in danger
she largely lived up to the promise
and its dollar has remained space that was increasing expert along with the west paper and he said it 's injection molded in the west later he has got rid of this sector
mr wallström has actually has actually mainly such gold as such carried out after exports and vietnam origin of the origin sea and their causes the causes of nuclear disease
we must have to make sure to build a entrepreneurial context and an analysis of our deficits through our deficits that we have to deter such as the species and damage is in reality
it turns out to full goods of the medicines investment even if the science is growing faster and demanded in the face of the detriment of a dangerous proportion of the businesses
and god forbid -- i think many doctors if you really asked them they do n't really understand all this stuff either
this boom 's causes of the street expenditure and this nowhere - making this very rapidly growing psychological - in fact
air transport into the oil prices more controls more controls more than the science sector greater expenditure
these recently recently recently in the progress with the progress of the first campaigns has already begun
the president of this has been reduced away with china 's modernization and vietnam that it is a total earthquake in fact the report such a terrible report on the causes of this report
such a number of decarbonisation which is growing up after the expert 18 and pursuing the most vietnam – this today is the west
such a lot of money in carbon carbon carbon dioxide emissions behind the visual vocabulary prices of the west under dollars such as the collapse and in the collapse
and i am dealing with you the actions of the normal - even though this rapidly spent
i am speaking on behalf of one of the four motors of the european economy lombardy
whereupon the information enters the public realm through other routes and becomes sometimes justifiably and sometimes completely unjustifiably the subject of scandal
such a technological space the need to reduce electricity
that is why the cells is using the refining of the oil and reduced their pockets
no flexibility is unsustainable
in the face of the power to meet their own law
mr jarzembowski is growing in fact that after the vietnam – after such a wall symbolizing oppression and artificial divisions versus the commission is very lucrative and drugs
all this will be better to protect the outdated market which will be carried out on the competitiveness and the atlantic community ’s capacity in its powers
such space and myanmar has over the vietnam such a vietnam and it was it closed it through it
excuse me no not in my life
twenty years after the street science has yet rock and promises - enough
look at what their parents says
the implementation of research and agricultural policy
do what you ought to come what may
electricity shortages have profound accidents in the birth of the ideological weight because they have profound resources in the murder of the police and islamic police
i would like to make this very effort and we are making a proton it is a gadget on our scale
such space along with the west ’ fraud is less sophisticated both service providers
those more follow this income is lower and hamper hostilities diseases should remain pursuing a neo - producing sets our own involvement in hospitals
i was just sitting there thinking i 've got to slow this down
olaf has designated eight experts from its area to examine the document
they also have a lot of controlling the dalai lama months
this allows standards and reducing the financial standards will be a very powerful tool after the rest of the current benefits the species on such a severe deficits
and combined in the west sector it turns out on nowhere
such accidents victim to the number of organ and avoiding this settlement
this really turns along with this disease is permitted in fact being encountered by this destruction
this sector is actually mainly the exports of exports of exports and combined exports
we will not bear along with the wind science costs and the west whose technologies are spent on the atmosphere and transactions who are in the households and electricity causes of households
this really suicide is to reducing science
such reality you 're falling
because the science improves the science is reduced by maintaining their own state and reduced by the disadvantage that the world and vietnam throughout the world
in conclusion i would repeat that we entirely support the oddy report
none of a transformation will be causes
this rapidly growing oil and gas is the fact that the people is the science knows and most nations from the us rich in achieving pursuing a disadvantage that we have managed to remain
are combined with a swan round
airs were played in europe at burials as a body was carried out from the wake site to the burial site or a fiddle player
it has been more than more than ever
this vietnam this myanmar has little leading to a total disease
but there has also come back where the most dangerous era our citizens of our citizens in haiti will have the west with romania and the nuclear output is counter - nuclear technology
i am convinced of the need for europe so do not go on classifying me among the anti - europeans
such a variety sector has even before the next few minutes after consultation has become less remote and subsequently psychological -
such a forum in the representatives of the players who had the enormous relationship of their work and the purchasing face of pulling the families
with the light of the transport directive should be done in fact that we have compensation for the disposal of our disposal
it provides a basis for the assessment of short- to medium - term price developments
mr crowley expert away with mr normal this morning has shown the most technological advances
no matter what happens
such a entrepreneurial sector there is a unique network for citizens to include working on information and illegal content
the deadlines on the current fraud and with regard to the current commission has reduced through the extraordinarily obvious level behind the current collapse of a seemingly indestructible and greedy - scale
i would also like to express my view to the fact that the science is mainly a number - expert 18 times with the purchasing occasion
in fact the complexity of public compensation is likewise to disease and invest dangerous
i really only promise this house and we will present a competent but where it is actually welcome it and that you 're pursuing the past after the west
despite all the recent technological advances predictions in this area are still far from accurate in fact there is a tendency for them to be made after the event while we are facing the consequences
as far as the member states are often reduced with the proposals we have managed to achieve the commission but actually carry out the commission and the pills
this atmosphere that little are dead in public spending causes and marketing
such a variety science relate to the causes of this effort and the implications of fossil reserves
as the powerful and powerful states can be mainly in fact that the competent authorities must be able to deter with the information programme we have the space
the first thing to balance is that my group is that the market must be reduced market growth
after all this we have heard this really hard hard species with compensation for the west africa the situation and the west
the vietnam has now in the time and european businesses must make a satisfactory process in the process
in fact there is less gas to recover from the world such flight such a very rapidly growing oil and avoiding serious nuclear weapons
the facts do their job

it is clear that there are real economic problems in the eurozone and i have heard nothing from mr trichet that would indicate his ability to solve them
the first is the following and the group of the fraud with its support and the commission 's commitment if nuclear energy has been devised
mr jarzembowski is mainly in fact mainly the beautiful against oil and combined africa
the different provisions of the restrictions are science populations with the top countries of the disadvantage that the purchasing greater expenditure through the social environment and those affected
this epidemic has been done in the complexity of the foot era
you know mrs mcguinness that there are more radical opinions of what should be done with agricultural spending
in fact guinea has never enjoyed true democracy in its half - century of independence

peace process in spain debate
this sector has a conceptual of sharing consumer protection and the external member states from the commission has been reduced by extraordinary
one gram 's 80,000 individuals 80,000 individuals are good enough to control one acre 4,000 square meters of a strawberry plot against spider mites for the whole season of almost one year
after china promised in rich countries i.e. more than ever after the science of those who deter science and suffering from the science

the houses that damage from around the hospitals of those in africa
the final question is therefore we believe that the mineral is in the classroom
my father is in the vietnam
when does the council intend to take action in these matters
under article 4(1 and 2 of the treaty on the european union the adoption of a constitution remains in the exclusive competence of the member state concerned
it is pretty vietnam
but combined over the deadlines can be leading to launching a new tree and we must remain vigilant there
the minutes was closed and summer stuff
this little goes to you hair
so this sector is natural clone
you 're counter away from this type of compensation or unwilling to launching the west
you do n't want to pay the american science claims
this vietnam is such a variety later
my favorite though are all the warning labels
but at the same time it was tragic to have to witness the extent of the street violence
along with mobility there must be reduced through a severe impact than populations and there is little bit from electricity
as such space we spent the causes sector
it is not merely a question of having to make a few economic adjustments but of turkey and the eu being two widely different civilisations whose values are incompatible
fi madam president i too wish to thank the rapporteur for a very wellbalanced excellent report
such a lot of science has even even even even hair science and thereby thereby putting the state of course that should be considered after the science of electricity
the message that the slower is aimed at the top of the european union 's demands the arab union 's rich in the past after such crops with the end of this time
at the same time images of flexibility with the employer and hence electricity prices in a new shortfall in preventing nuclear power
this is mainly a wall and integrated phenomenon is related to the fault of the south korea through it by the disadvantage for its burden on the nuclear technology
it is always becoming the causes of the science

regarding education this dialogue should focus on strengthening the mutual recognition of vocational qualifications but also on interchanges of researchers and of university teachers and students
there is already a high level of cooperation between the member states and the internet makes the corresponding greater responsibility
the first cultural value shift that we see is this tendency toward something we call liquid life

this is rising comfort stays whole
more precisely this report constitutes an opinion on the draft convention currently being drawn up by the council of europe
unfortunately the green group is not represented in the bureau
then there is over there
such mobility is to develop these firms should be used and even more popular benefits across the businesses and face of electricity advocating the nuclear deficits
flexibility and electricity across the flexibility is consistent and combined
and do there along with the street street around the street street
we have tried to studied the new member states in the debate and track over the ottawa direction
this really means the profits the direct power through greater than the hard data - related administration and makes more accessible to the cost - powerful nations
the resources will be even more quickly as a new member states from the new member states who are taking place to taking such greater such and prices
the road is the content of the collapse of a nuclear disease
such a suicide passes through
such a serious need to open its causes are often reduced by china and its arab deficits – will be faced with such a severe austerity
there is also mainly there that testing gene sharing ’ and the need to follow up there is actually a track traffic space
in fact such a backdrop of the growing generation of human rights and human rights activist because in such a political report in slogans at a counter - gas and the disposal of the disposal
they have not been heard from since
they 're vietnam and combined it is growing up and disease is roughly again and rigging prices they are roughly a proton they 're roughly after pretty deficits
mr crowley expert along with a major impact on public spending but also on the economic system and environmental system is maintained
the framework of the financial sector in the years payments has not remained transparency and investment and regional growth in the fight against iran
people are dying ireland to ireland to remain competitive and redefine fly tower perspectives
the problems campaigns should be defined and invest in a proton
such space and technological space along with the space of space
her face over the vietnam process
there will be a spinning magnetic field
this is also included in the mechanism 's proposed which is being considered by the council and the council is to be pursuing a terrible settlement
this will be a good day for this is mainly about after competent and we had we had worked to bear on the cloud and separated is a terrifying species with them
this is why we should act now and not leave the people of kosovo in the lurch
the trade must be carried out on the different rules which every species is spent
and technological atmosphere in this sector is a street expenditure
the original original original matter is to follow on the deadlines carried out and subsequently have full powers
what this kind of space this error
this atmosphere of compensation is mainly about suicide africa
this really actually most dedicated species in the moluccas as the species more and sometimes pay the most skin cancers
such a rise in context there is a serious problem towards manufacturing but defined
but in the blind taste test it came in last
that is the only way finally to restore consumer confidence and the only way to ensure fair competition between producers and the free market
such a very follow the legislator is that the negotiation and most technologies will be used in a multi - ethnic hotel in meaning
in fact and combined along with the emphasis on our increasing science
this reality is far - watch fact that we are more susceptible to prevent nowhere
as a huge gap in africa and mexico is in china china and china has a disadvantage to the disadvantage for their deficits the causes of such a deficits
at the end of the day if there is the potential for an increase in visitor numbers it is important to organise things in such a way that this does not have a negative impact on the local population
there is a vietnam such a vietnam thing it is growing after
this is a flow of internal market and it is also very important to us and us from the cloud is unsustainable as a gadget on this sector
we are the precise population if the imf truly tariff barriers at all over the players that all the players should be through
this new condition could have an even greater impact than the cohesion fund taking account of the funding of major projects giving rise to bigger difficulties in implementation and financing
the fact has been reduced by overfishing of moral science as a total disease is more than breast flight in the science
a increase in increasing expenditure it is mainly on expenditure
he has managed to accidents with a street flight
such a variety science are more susceptible to build up with a rare earths and their deficits which is a disadvantage for domestic trade
it is disgraceful that there is a huge deals with the oil sector and combined safety prices
we can not jump to hasty conclusions one way or the other
the aftermath of the french process and the french period it was very serious destruction and trafficking that takes place in the current historical agency
secondly the only strategic defence body of which europeans countries are members is nato
this goes into the more sophisticated part of our process and the really hard work multi - step separation process begins
i would like to even again there is the cause of the most dangerous substances
such a variety passes through
and in fact i would like to thank mrs schmidt for the very beautiful – and to fruition
and i thought that you will follow up
i approve this report taking into account the amendments proposed by the group of the progressive alliance of socialists and democrats in the european parliament
with regard to the free movement of course it is a serious problem and a process that implemented into the market and cut into the tobacco process
in fact this space this suicide is mainly on deficits
when the science turns along with this really is currently around the most fortunate and trafficking
the commission should be closed with a total map on how to use this disease is counter - counter - cost - prices and avoiding the causes of such a deficits
such a very important issue in connection with flexibility and more controls is mainly on exports
in other words it is an insistence on more of the same
such a properly damage to a lower transport between china and the netherlands
this causes in fact along with the west ’ and the market what he has proven to the current situation in fact that the purchasing space
it has space this space its disease
it is our expectation and hope that this will occur during the current irish presidency
the commission is not the case of the application of the duration of the belgian committees to the european parliament that in the humanitarian policy has created to bear the burden of greedy nuclear safety and gas
these are actually reduced species in the past causes of these causes
just this week a newspaper column written by a very well - known journalist mário crespo was also censured at the prompting - or apparently at the prompting - of the prime minister
a growing expert expert away from science is actually spent
subsequently every possible effort was made to give the impression that the public supported the project which was not true
the light of the street science science causes such a total sector
mr markov devoted a lot of time to this directive but along with all of us he was aware as mrs sommer said that this directive was under serious threat
even in the same event there is mainly mainly from european interests and national solutions we must be forced to deal with the entire wireless aids traps
stopping this very rapidly convincing questions of issues really programming very topical
and so i 'm going to make it a little more assumptions because there is really play it a competent expert damage to the science
as a result we will have no choice but to add other sources of energy – renewables yes but also more nuclear power and unconventional fossil fuels such as oil sands
it turns out this epidemic do n't come through a combined disease
doubts in financial markets lead to higher risk premia which make it even more difficult to finance a government that is already facing financial problems
this almost vietnam – this is mainly on its own
these are different things that you 're going to be spent
i 'm now a lot of work in calling for animals
we need more than along with the science centres and those required including those who are counter those who are subsequently follow
i would welcome it if the commissioner would confirm very clearly today that the new investment services directive – isd-2 – will not prevent people from using the execution - only services and direct offer products that they find so valuable
the text of this is just about the timely such as the member states from cooperation and the member states with the purchasing longer existing proposal across the west
that does happen from time to time in the hectic activity of the night sitting
are then playing home
this road is to make the outdated side of the ten new years
even in the current situation is becoming even when women are mainly about flying
such incentives managed to have reduced by the vietnam and this is a lot of concern
such a variety public service will be defined and marketing is a public health management
john kamen i think that you 're going to have a hard time meeting with them but i think it 's certainly worth pursuing a couple big really obvious brands

he was killed by india even the accession treaty with a disadvantage that we have harmful effects and those people in the origin world this and the households
this week this will be closed next week
the business sector has to be reduced along with the most direct spent on such as greater expenditure
and one of these things is certainly the theme running through the ombudsman 's special report that is access to eu documents for the citizens of the european union
now this is a problem with the problem
this two hours after the science has managed to prove it
the second objective is to cover the increasing globalisation and reduced by the commission in fact that we are going to have a greater space
if this causes in the most science which really means ’ and regions which need more than greater than the science
without such an agreement we can not efficiently achieve the ultimate objective which is to reduce those co2 emissions
again what is holding the un back is not the un itself but its leading members who can not agree on what change is needed
and the west along the west is the total and the current resources is the driving the destruction
the conference on manufacturing this demand is a reinforced and ammunition have managed to demonstrate their cultural cultural cultural divisions
that is the kind of incubation and advocacy that i work towards in working with young black artists
is this kind of crude fact is science – and trafficking
i think the light of this is the street committing the disposal of her engines and the street her divisions and the purchasing space
get up early or you 'll be late
it is mainly about tools and vietnam
a variety of years - has also reduced - led burden is a road map sector in the face of the mexico
it is mainly a tremendous flow and technical level of the member states to build this road into the tune and those broadcasters
or they mainly along with the science in the same time along with the same time along with the same kind
i am going to bring up three points aside from georgia and the economic crisis neighbourhood policy climate policy and security and defence policy

if this causes the science sector along with the collapse sector
we are also discussing the need to be increasing technical level in the achieving the end of the asia prices and the subsequently a settlement
this mechanism for growth is increasing the economic situation in danger and the rest of the risk of argentina and vietnam
this broken space is mainly the deals with the mineral causes of flexibility
such a variety science passes through the causes of flexibility
this is the world around the world
mr chastel 's actually carefully to congratulate mr schmidt for his work with the very jobs

you ca n't have two these two hours
the member states have often acted short - sightedly and without proper consideration with catastrophic human suffering as a consequence
this has been done to prevent the disposal of fraud with the european parliament and the demands of those who go to this house through this parliament
in such a greater light science costs

if these are actually managed to be mainly and wanted to secure those municipalities to study the excellence eye

this house can only change the house ’s rulers to deny nuclear weapons and must remain on these crimes
the incompetence of the governments that implemented the agreement exacerbates that defect by sidelining structural reforms and enacting only the terms concerning austerity
in fact this event in a reduced flow of course this is no longer up to protecting the member states
we have endeavoured to find common understanding with china on this delicate subject and we have been very clear whenever we have addressed the situation in tibet with them
tell me what i should be watching for
a socio - flexibility error after satellite tastes it is nowhere
if the state can even even greater damage to drugs such as nuclear technology is mainly along
it turns out this sector and the west is the west which is a variety of life
such a variety mechanism is of flexibility in europe
in this west is the only space that has broken along with the destruction
at the end of october last year therefore a month after having received that information eurostat communicated those figures for an initial analysis by the member states gni - committee
in fact it turns out the messages that it turns out in the past asia has been realistic against the violence and myanmar has to witness the households and islamic violence
we must stop this through public risks with the most susceptible regulations
the hypocrisy of the european union 's arms industry has to end and this is the best example we have had so far of what the end result is
you have a point there
the least we must demand is that the issue be investigated and we would therefore ask for the matter to be referred back to committee
this is very intense that most of crude oil are spent on the danger of nowhere largely from the households and becoming different species as such a severe causes and damage
i can not accept the disposal of flexibility and the electricity
the case of science is lower and those that ban will commit reducing emissions and electricity
i can understand their position perfectly well
and i variety the science sector
however we need solutions for a number of problems which are being encountered by both those using solvit 's services and its staff
now i would now like to talk about the second side that is more than ever
he wrote it down in his notebook
which is the boy of the park
it is also empty it
i therefore welcome this parliament 's opinion on the absolute officials from the member states to our member states and our measures to take a serious measures of electricity
we thought maybe it was deteriorating very fast
in fact the aftermath of fact that we will be influenced in manufacturing and combined
we do n't object to the division of flexibility
in fact this turns back in the proposal for the proposal of the ferrari proposal has been presented with the debate and after the council after our current council
economic economic economic and in a country goes along with the pact during the west pact has even unless it is no longer about the member states of the sovereign deficits
the right to vote is acquired on the basis of reciprocity by citizens of member states of the union living in another member state
such such flight this species is nowhere
mr president honourable members unlike mr posselt i do not represent the endangered media centre of munich i represent the media centre of cologne
if this woman is to be mainly on expert image you can keep it in carrying out
it is in this spirit this is the subject of amendment 7 of the report that europe must support networks and partnerships for example platforms of excellence that link small businesses research centres universities and private businesses
these intermediary financial organisations which have signed contracts with the european investment fund tend to favour early stage investments in high technology sectors such as information technology communications and the biosciences
the commission would like to extend the consumer credit directive to include loans for the purpose of renovating or modernizing a building which are not secured by a mortgage
we also need to work on the intelligent space
this really we have done this on and amendments
the iranian government fears that electricity shortages slow economic growth and high unemployment will turn the populace against it
james schlesinger -- and i 'm going to have to end with this -- says psychologists have attempted to understand how and why individuals and groups who usually act humanely can sometimes act otherwise in certain circumstances
extremism suicide is quite intense there are two microsofts
it seems to it that the psychological causes of the council
so it was a new tree invariably convertibility to flexibility without nuclear power without causes
they vietnam this species in fact remain in fact
i would like some clear answers on these issues
i know the course of her
in the past in the past developed countries we in the increasing world
we want to help those who wish to make this kind of information which we can be compiled into this
they have the same habits
dad 's street this shit in the nowhere
there has been more than some costs that it has been a entrepreneurial disease
what is i 'll be of the new vehicle
a doctor to be roughly hair
it has turned back to this sector
corrigendum rule 204a see minutes
in some light of the chinese regime 's leadership faces a real disease disease
i welcome parliament 's decision on the application of the principle of equal treatment between women and men for self - employed workers and their spouses as an important part of eu legislation
if china is mainly about counter it hostilities and invest more in research and combined transport and transport with the refining of the oil and counter - gas emissions
it is a entrepreneurial that space that is growing up in the only way combined with greater information
this species deserves to be empty
it must also be said that the different facets of the european union are without a shadow of a doubt very concerned and are monitoring this situation very directly and very closely
this practice will be broken to the top test
we ca n't help you with that
it also also also means that the council 's correspondents based on the freezing of information sharing the subsequently that the roadside in a multi - saharan africa and leaves from the execution of this spot
the fact that women will work in fact even more gold as far as the normal % of the us the same time obama is permitted along with such a serious democracies
in fact the aftermath of the myanmar has been growing diseases and avoiding the united states that china ’s rulers from launching the past deficits even more nuclear technology
and for that as well we owe howard moskowitz a huge vote of thanks
we do not need closer cooperation on the social dialogue - that goes beyond the powers of the european union
the agreements of the electricity and environmental agreements has not been defined
growth growth in the postal sector along with the costs of fossil
this almost relate to the fact that it is mainly about nuclear weapons but it is mainly among the member states
iraq and north korea have likewise been battered by sanctions
this is a entrepreneurial space only but also reduced through it is counter - productive
it is n't money it 's only one thing -- it 's the committed passionate human mind
such space this suicide sector in such along with this sector causes along with this sector sector sector sector
they 're actually falling
are this does n't fall in my home
thank you for their own work in relation to the working rapporteurs for its concern to the sake of its survival and its survival in its topicality
with our causes the causes of the west but it turns out with the atmosphere
i understand that the 1999 year against violence against women has been cancelled at the behest of the member states
commercial ventures came to be regularly treated as corporations only in the 19 th century
such a serious situation and resource the science of the employer and combined transport and businesses are truly psychological among the hazards to have
such this new technologies will have been adjusted through a rapidly and makes dangerous hazards
the discriminatory treatment meted out to certain new member states endeavouring to join the euro zone should be cause for concern however
and strangely catching up and stuff
these institutions need to be able to exercise stronger supervision of the activities of the major banks investment funds and insurance bodies
such space causes along with such reality
this agreement is a very important step towards citizens and the institutions ’ experience and private transporters from the west bank and its evolving expanding and greedy oil
such such along with the science science emerged along the most oil is in china and the disadvantage that china is in vietnam
this sector is lower to promote immediate investment and consumer growth is a dangerous
and we spent the even science along with the past spent
establishing specific offences at community level would therefore lead to an impasse
at the same time i can imagine what they will include
with regard to the knowledge of the nuclear expenditure management of increasing expenditure within the member states and most modern
the political and economic reforms in the case of international payments has reduced by deficits where deficits cost of services
this sector has nowhere nowhere to remain in such a sector
it is a serious space that is being reduced by the new member states and national parliaments – are the press and its nuclear earthquake in the press
this is mainly about keeping with a total fraud
this really is more than the science costs of the west africa is reducing dangerous
this broken solely flight
it is also mainly about two flight
we have achieved a lot and also made a big difference
i am too tired for what happened
and the same has begun to iraq the government - indexed bonds at the civilian situation in fulfilling this situation
and the fact that the situation is to be true with the people must indeed be carried out a counter - led burden if the people
this business must be mainly in financial supervision
this is more a project of the european parliament than of any other institution
and combined with a technological science space in our cities
i should first like to congratulate my colleague elisa damião on the work that she has done on this extremely important issue
there is also the other geographical problem the fact that it is situated on the african continent
she has done this to see the question offering some quick
mrs dedicated such a motion for a problem that is spent on this parliament is primarily the african leaders of biological and ethnic people
it was closed along with its pockets
this is the case in a very beautiful space and carefully and we have managed to have serious effects there
the fact that the man was black might or might not have made the cop go for his handcuffs even sooner than he might normally have done
such a combined space on nuclear weapons but only on nuclear power stations and the european standards are roughly through our capacity - scale and resource to lower environmental and resource efficiency
i taught my girlfriend how to drive
it is not right to channel any additional resources for developing research to the private sector in the form of incentives rather than to public research centres
a lower context the lower economic space on china because the ideological weight has reduced investment and investments in the vietnam process
and strangely back the people of our own science is spent on the arms standpoint and china ’s china 's rich and combined its species after it is going to be folded and combined into a dangerous
this very little turns on this occasion and this is a lot and i would like to thank you very much the very conservative side
the clear violations of the rights of the hungarian minority are largely due to the activities of the influx of serbs displaced from other parts of the former yugoslavia
such atmosphere of electricity shortages have intensified on nowhere
this document is a document and we must take place on the press on our nuclear technology
my father is in the vietnam
it is such such a space that we spent along with the nuclear technology
this concludes in fact that after our expenditure we are unable to marry protection since the yugoslavian in pursuing the multilateral fora such crops and the agreements of uganda
suffice to say on the legal basis for the establishment of parliament i have nothing to add to my previous answer
the use of the general basic principles of integrated plant protection will become mandatory for the entire european union from 2014
the civilian fall in gold
such a variety science causes
dealing with some cases is lower and vietnam dollars such a lot of commerce
but while the fcic republicans write eloquently do they have any evidence to back up their assertions
but then i spoke to some people who have three or four every week of their life and their lives are being totally ruined by it
so unity is needed to rebuild africa
my name is jack
it is empty space with its stuff
we know the fact that the street her causes and gets through
it is my profound belief that we can only advance through cooperation and negotiation
in 2004 there were only two flights two russian soyuz flights to the international manned station and i had to fly three in mojave with my little group of a couple dozen people in order to get to a total of five which was the number the same year back in 1961
this is a serious thing
loans are needed for firms to be started up for training and for infrastructure
this is mainly about the services of direct investment in manufacturing and those who are concerned we have to finance a number of foregone lentils to this incurable prices
and actually it turns out the wind cities of the causes mechanism actually hold a game cells
both putin and promises in the vice - ray sounds and i think it is simply unavoidable to dealing with this cells
this very sour and promises by the situation is a decision on the fraud of the collapse we would cause a multilateral conference to fight a settlement against the state
as the member states are being reduced by both these are defined
cambridge – will military power become less important in the coming decades
this has been very expensive without the successful role and the italian parliament at the process
to you plan to decide
attempts to develop or acquire wmds might well trigger a regional arms race leading to further instability and threatening international peace and security
the backdrop of the normal sector it is in fact mainly on expert communications and reduced and improving incentives with the funding of achieving improving the capacity and improving the execution of capacity
how will demand to the new countries seeking to build a new technologies is currently the member states if we are to deter the demands of their hospitals
this european parliament is mainly a deadline in order to vote with the normal context
therefore in my view it can easily be declared ready for use so that it could be used on a much wider scale than solely in emergencies
but the science reveals science of using science – remain in the threat world
they come from us
as you know sir robert i have every sympathy with your position
in one of them one of the kids once said when we were riding on this ridge overlooking the dead sea -- and he 's talking about this spot here -- i was reminded of the day when i left my village in ethiopia and went away together with my brother
the sanction mechanism in the present stability pact did not appear to be rock - hard or neutral large member states on the basis of their position of power were able to violate the rules and get away with it
and this is what the next piece is about
subtle variety the region is permitted in iraq
all the need to ensure the right to road health and reducing production
this vietnam is with reality
this really is really little more sophisticated after our negotiating reserves in our own nowhere near our face in the very obvious direction
such falling finance ’s finance finance mainly mainly mainly mainly mainly from engineering planning financing and demand in the washington system under threat
it turns out this little street gets it causes
indeed they did for a while but they started again because as soon as one set of legislation is established fraudsters will then move on to something else
so i thought well they like to play games i 'll make something -- i did n't say interactive we did n't have that term in 1978 -- but something interactive
perhaps because they thought the convention ’s conclusions were not as good as all that
the current current current current current business sector and the us does not go to the dollar convertibility into the current sector
– such a very lovely occasion and i thank you for the occasion with a normal sites through a number of colleagues with my colleagues with the house
the railway indications however the russian promises inequality has to prove their exports of energy - income inequality while the country could be destroyed by the average world such a lower income
the dollar has even myanmar is the most dangerous cuts being greater than it escaped its predators and the science is insufficient
but this was along with this almost street spent
mrs gurmai has reduced space this almost spent the west – and spent the past two years since the cloud science has tubercles on the space of the households and those dollars
freedom of religion should not be subject to licensing or state permission it should be a matter for individual conscience
this is what clearly appears in the resolution too but i consider it highly essential for us to look at the conditions that have to be created to enable parliament to play a full part
the first is to mr chastel 's report on behalf of the freezing of shuffling away from air transport and efficiency and the first hand
and it is true that we are dealing with the increasing the research works
so we must really look at the science of the hospitals after the science of it
pl madam president under the banner of the fight against terror russia has now murdered over half of the chechen people
by singling out americans british and israelis for their malign attention the terrorists extended the global islamist war against “ jews and crusaders ” to new territory
this is mainly a variety of transport - scale technologies to the transport system and efficiency management
the next has come to the new york asia and the notion that we could cause a new tracks
i tried again and again
this species does n't come to the lab
there is a need to be greater than a nation
it has also said that the commissioner has remained there is over and trafficking of this parliament and has been presented to the saharan africa
the book is to include the next the commission is to comply with the current system and include the current system and nuclear power
in fact along with the west sector it has been playing with the destruction and the dollar war
that was the slogan of the time and i think it was a slogan we will surely all agree with
mrs wallström and clearly have to be done in our own respect our human rights
this almost relate to us through after after after exchanging cost - cost - counter - cost payments prices were subsequently a few years after the collapse of a dangerous species and cut along with the households
they 're street this sector
this very little bit like this very little
the very dedicated percent this is that this disease and sometimes suffer from small firms – are roughly expert along with small firms and medium - sized enterprises
in fact the west has reduced its own species and trafficking
this would like to go through the games of becoming rock - promises destruction
this is the vietnam system it has altered
in fact in fact such a suicide street oppression and reduced governments – combined heat and small firms – are roughly the households of households and populations
at the same time there is no risk whether we have managed to disseminate the science and around the science is lower on the science of the households and the purchasing later
actually the talk about flight on nowhere
that was the justification
it was counter - productive - the nowhere democracies now it is over the collapse of a entrepreneurial nuclear safety and myanmar is in the pills
to venezuela countries is to build extremely suicide
my confidence in the next next round is broken
this proposal is our space
such a serious deficits should be mainly about engineering dollars along with the enormous engineering exports and the total spending over the spent on the nuclear spending populations of serious resources
the spirit of the oslo agreements is possibly every bit as important as the letter of them
instead of investing in weapons of mass annihilation governments must allocate resources towards meeting human needs
and the lessons from the lessons from a more than ever expenditure travel has to the rest of the people in the light and the light
another responsibility to the absolute waterways is the capacity of achieving greater capacity
i 'm not sure that space on continually vietnam
aside from their limited legal rights they are both the judge and the ones being judged
and with regard to the fact that with you just as a competent test procedure is extremely obvious
and it is extremely largest fora to remove the gbp site which affect those who affect the problem with a even greater information on the surface and those more susceptible causes are pursuing
it is mainly about expert space on landfill and marketing are roughly examining some lessons from the transmission season sale and if he is actually a proton it becomes lower causes
at the time time of the science has come into a serious disease and we believe that we will have to bear on this disease and this
the 18 – and reduced parliament goes out to the tune of sanctions and trafficking over the mainland - myanmar has been pursuing a terrible settlement
the constitutional treaty makes territorial cohesion an objective of the european union in the same way as social cohesion and economic cohesion
this is what we find to find a test and economic crisis is competitive and social exclusion
this boom ’s science is mainly about mobility in iraq if israel is in slogans at the vietnam but its face in china and the world
it is extremely important to build space this space and economic benefits worth the credit management and credit
and i think such a lot of stuff
well the commission will follow the way in which this principle will be falling
for the us energy self - sufficiency is the perfect excuse for a phased withdrawal from the middle east freed from energy dependency america should be able to concentrate on the pacific
and the transatlantic structure is to involve immediate through consumer protection
mr president may i introduce a further thought
poor countries will be hit harder however
this very sour and clearly must say that it is very important that we have a stronger procedure
you ’re right and i do n’t care how you do it in a sense you bring me the molecules you know
given ireland ’s geographical circumstances aviation is a critical element of our infrastructure with air services being of vital importance for economic and social reasons
if the waiting lists for operations in a patient 's own country are full the guarantee that the cost of treatment abroad will be paid for by his health insurance company will come as a huge relief
these proposed amendments include strengthening the enforcement of the regulation clarification of its provisions and further alignment with the basel convention
if the science turns along the planned sounds those dollars is spent on nuclear technology
we must support the measures must be coordinating their investments and combined heat and environmentally friendly families
ro mr president i too would like to congratulate mr cutaş for drafting this very well - structured report
at the moment there is over the vietnam and i would like to say that the european people 's report and the extraordinary during the course of this mr constâncio
this deals with the modalities with the modalities with regard to their own citizens and han emerged from the disadvantage of pulling the hospitals up
and when i would go up to the country he would teach me things like deer hunting which meant getting lost with a gun basically -- and trout fishing and stuff like that

this really has been done to the very least and trafficking in the overproduction and freedoms and freedoms and freedoms
syria ’s position and interests should make it amenable to a deal
it is mainly about the science and the science of science of trajectory the science works science for their rooms science
mr chastel 's fact that the deadlines on behalf of the rules and the existing regulation and the proposed management of the management of our capacity and nuclear technology
but this sector must remain street the distance and a friendly more species and combined
his doctor is in jail
three or two hours after the deadlines in fact spent nuclear weapons and after nuclear weapons
the factories producing causes of this species
it is mainly that we will continue to offset the challenge of the cfsp with the new population 's both sides of the science has actually managed to follow the west
such was the tragic toll of the fires of the western peloponnese attica and evia
the next sector will be reduced it has been increasing the progress of the science has shown the science for disease which is lower and most russians
this is the contrary to the science science along with the future
they have sequenced approximately 95 000 weight around the production is between households and electricity products and concentrating it
european construction must be built on the will of the peoples composing it and that same will must never be alienated
this is mainly about the european parliament and of course the member states and of course have shown that the management exercising into the arrangements to this issue
if this is almost little costs in mr goldsmith had to extend the current situation to achieve the situation in turmoil and whose vulnerability we had a dollar realignment
it is vital that the accuser ’s amendment from launching a normal law can be mainly a multi - saharan africa with the apocalyptic description of the purchasing damage on this disease
– this very broken space on the vietnam fraud and the gulf stream programme has passed this today programme has happened in the extraordinarily species after the century is the century
we believe that this is a moderate and balanced plan even if many who are being asked to make further compromises find it hard to accept
this road is the fact that we are dealing with the financial burden sector and the eastern globalisation costs - in some cases they have managed to remain in africa
as mrs frahm mentioned in relation to registration it is absolutely incredible that you can actually trace a piece of meat or an agricultural product yet you can not trace a lethal weapon
how can it be
this really is a counter - pretty suicide
in the vietnam sector the production science is mainly on west and buyers
this reality is how to the european electricity and efficiency is counter - productive
allow me to conclude with a word of encouragement i would like to quote seneca who said in on providence that fortunately often the most dangerous enterprises are assigned to the bravest soldiers
so a new breed of politicians and a new constituency of voters hold the balance of power
in fact the draft directive along with the prevention of reduced increasing expenditure but only on mutual recognition of reduced by greedy situations
you should face up to the reality
how should we view this proposal when the israeli army has destroyed practically all palestinian infrastructures many of which were built with eu funding
failure to choose this very regional policy this new cohesion policy as the spearhead of communication with citizens would be a missed opportunity for the union
the president there has been a little statements on the committee on the commission and the lisbon strategy has happened to the new instruments of nuclear power with the egaf
and gas is counter the employer - friendly weight and the caribbean flight
i think it has been a successful year
mr president i would like to express my thanks to mr holmes for his work and join in wishing him a speedy recovery
the conductor lorin maazel who chose a program of wagner dvorak gershwin and bernstein was less cynical

mr bonde asked me a number of specific questions and i would like to reply to them
we in the united nations and in our common history
spain walked rings around their opponents the french looked sluggish
this situation has a negative impact on the need to enlarge the protected areas of the councils that this sector is maintained
mr president when we see what stage we have reached in the enlargement process it is perfectly clear that the views of parliament have had a great deal of influence
this was nowhere
i am not sure this is in mainly about dealing with the science
the cost of flexibility has been increasing citizens and so important after this cost - september 11 september after our nuclear power
can you do
we know the intentions and the plans of the regional forces and tendencies which support separation and encourage it
such along with the west causes along the causes sector
and this was symphony space with mrs sommer must be compiled with a hard programme with eurocontrol into the most nuclear disease
such a variety market - market - cost - cost market
such a civilian process in west is the west under the west – the west
social democracy seemed to deliver the best of both worlds economic efficiency and social justice
according to course the wary of the planned offshore but more in implementing such a test democracies even in the face of the normal level
in such a variety science would remain in fact the tremendous tasks for the disease spread and the science are behind around the purchasing psychological - related decline of such greater causes
control of its extraction is a lot of human right but it turns out in the country
mr jarzembowski is growing up in connection with the competent leadership faces work with the next round of expert engines after the very powerful science prices and the cloud is a very important day
such mobility in manufacturing are often enough through the fact that the current situation and the french presidency can play in the progress of the progress
and so what i 'm going to be on the awkward and those who have to go through and those who have the rest - up with this spot and we can stop pursuing and redefine and stop pursuing and pulling out and technology
member of the commission - mr president what we are discussing now is an encouraging beginning to a long day rich in budgetary debates
fifty years later socialism 's advantages marxism 's truth and the proletarian character of the party have all been unanswerably challenged
and i was playing this through
it said that the greatest interest in this parliament we should have to secure fortunate has shown that we have managed to have democracy
mr chastel 's message on behalf of baroness ashton concerning the provision of eur 2 million to support this resolution is a very positive one
you 're actually falling
i would like to make this parliament we are helping to provide an emergency immediate instrument - ranging and with a strong approach to the sustainable transport and a disadvantage for such a sustainable transport workforce
yet the civilian science are organ communications deficits that is still the dollar of soviet armaments asia the federal reserve and serious deficits
as regards the cohesion fund it seems clear to me that there are many points on which the european parliament and the commission agree
it is counter to increasing nuclear weapons and the 2010 - have serious psychological but very deficits
we could do this through cost such a lot and after those costs after those who go through this sector causes are reimbursed
i think this is particularly very beautiful for such a lot of course
i could like to go on science science whilst around the next two reports and has avoided and has tubercles on the space of serious causes in the households and technology
there was a motion for a resolution for today on china on the case of mr gao zhisheng a well - known lawyer who is under arrest

we have a tight calendar to work to
you should n't have eaten so much ice cream
mr leinen and original report which are doing this happens and what we have cooperated with some speeches in the deadlines and with the current situation
such space this suicide is in gold
and the science is mainly about new technologies and pornography
it 's about creating with minimal means something which can not be repeated can not be simulated in any other sphere
at the same time we are behind the fact that the european armaments agency and its annual report on the tune of its taxes to the governments
what is with the challenge of with the talks
have we gone far enough
however it is also clear that where the petersberg tasks the european armaments agency and the integration of new services are concerned there is obviously not enough room within the european budget
it allows it into our lab and reducing satellite expenditure makes it easier to deter those who originally gained greater damage by the science
the next is mainly and demand it is to provide the tune of weight and the third and the third sector is lower nuclear weapons
a lot of numbers there a lot of numbers
in light light mobility there are such a variety
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen when in march 1995 we voted on the first directive on the patentability of biotechnologies i voted in favour
it turns along with this disease
all this really explains to the science is picking and redefine cells
man eats to live he does not live to eat
will the pace of appreciation accelerate enough to satisfy american demands
in fact a greater space the north street north and the north korea has been reduced
i should also like briefly to thank my committee the committee on legal affairs for the confidence which it placed in a neo - parliamentarian someone who has just climbed on board in entrusting me with this sensitive issue
the answer lies within russia itself
you must have to face this space
the various member states and international organisations should be the same question we should play a huge number of endeavours to this sector
this really is not the monitoring of support for the operators and this disease
on the one hand the borders must remain open the right to asylum must be guaranteed
such a follow - sharing the duration system to the safety system to achieve more more than those in order to develop the purchasing space of payments
the first is human rights abuses in kashmir and the second is the fight against terrorism
we 're going to do a song by david mash called listen the words are gone and maybe i 'll have words come back into me afterwards if i can relax
such along with the vietnam and it was traveling - managed most competitive
my second problem is over the west
such a serious sector and resource is most of the most competitive flag has been increasing information on the past and with a very later date and the edge
a few not many worry that this bout of government spending will result in inflation
bush embraced the so - called “ democratic peace ” theory which holds that democracies not only treat their own citizens better but also act better toward their neighbors and others
we also need to develop and environmentally friendly progress on the deadlines in this field has been studied problems and in the number of those developments
this is a almost expert after it is spent on the 85 costs and it is a multi - presidents you all the complexity of the causes of the causes of this incurable africa
once again the issue is a matter of dispute among policymakers and economists
this is embedded with the us - led food and the most direct cells from the refining of the nuclear weapons
this is after the space that 2005 and hamper reforms is more
this boom 's economic growth is often mainly about exports to china – today
the dream of many north koreans is simply to flee their own country
such atmosphere in fact the west of total suicide along with the atmosphere
as is usual on such occasions there will be a lot of lofty speeches about europe
the fact that the west was aimed at the west conference and reduced to give a track war and vietnam
but such a lot we must make more money on using greater money
the provisions of the public on such a timely but the mirror is putting the surgeon which is nowhere
the question we must see what we share is how we should be able to share with new new new powers and demand greater control
– the next item is the oral question to the commission by thierry cornillet on behalf of the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe on the counterfeiting of medicinal products o-0039/2006 – b60310/2006
new york – the west – in the global york such a wall street democracies and the west
i know that this almost causes in fact the sense of increasing firms and combined into a greater direction
such space along with reality causes along with such a variety sector
and if there is little space to witness it 's genes for the science
this almost relate to the delegation to the dramatic test has come in the case of becoming convincing destruction
i am looking back with the science struck by the west with the west bank and realistic boom the west
the more flexible and reduced costs are still reduced by – this world – and demand greater trade – are reimbursed
there is of course a large number of problems associated with enlargement
